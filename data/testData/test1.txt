                   How to become a lich ?
                ----------------------------

  Liches are high level clerics or magic-users who have become 
a very special undead. Before becoming a lich the cleric or
the magic user must have been at least 14th level in life,
although 18th level is most common.
once a lich is created it might drop in level ,but below 10th
level one cannot exists.
  Preperation for lichdom occurs while the figure is still 
alive and must be completed before his first "death".
if he dies somwhere along the line and is resurrected, than he 
must start all over again.
  The would-be lich needs this spells :Magic jar,Trap the soul 
and Enchant an item, plus a special potion(dealt later)
 and something to "jar" into. 
  The item into which a lich will jar is preapered by having 
enchant an item cast upon it. the item cannot be of the common
variety, but must be of high quality,solid,and of at least 
2000gp in value. The item must make a saving throw at if it were
the person casting the spell. (a cleric would have to have the 
spells Enchant an item and Magic Jar cast for him,and it is the
contracted magic user's level that would be used for the 
saving throw.) The item can contain prior magics, but wooden 
items are not acceptable.
