Cushing Co.--Berwick & Smith Co.\\n', '\\n', 'NORWOOD, MASS., U.S.A.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'PREFACE\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'As things now stand, the course of instruction in American history in\\n', 'our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject.\\n', 'Three separate books are used. First, there is the primary book, which\\n', 'is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and\\n', 'anecdotes. Second, there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth\\n', 'grade, generally speaking, an expansion of the elementary book by the\\n', 'addition of forty or fifty thousand words. Finally, there is the high\\n', 'school manual. This, too, ordinarily follows the beaten path, giving\\n', 'fuller accounts of the same events and characters. To put it bluntly, we\\n', 'do not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their\\n', 'study of history in the lower grades. If mathematicians followed the\\n', 'same method, high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the\\n', 'multiplication table and fractions.\\n', '\\n', 'There is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism advanced above. It\\n', 'is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history\\n', 'their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route. No teacher of\\n', 'history will deny this. Still it is a standing challenge to existing\\n', 'methods of historical instruction. If the study of history cannot be\\n', 'made truly progressive like the study of mathematics, science, and\\n', 'languages, then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding\\n', 'their subject to the already overloaded curriculum. If the successive\\n', 'historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text--more\\n', 'facts, more dates, more words--then history deserves most of the sharp\\n', 'criticism which it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and\\n', 'economics.\\n', '\\n', 'In this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a\\n', 'new high school text in American history. Our first contribution is one\\n', 'of omission. The time-honored stories of exploration and the\\n', 'biographies of heroes are left out. We frankly hold that, if pupils know\\n', 'little or nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John\\n', 'Smith by the time they reach the high school, it is useless to tell the\\n', 'same stories for perhaps the fourth time. It is worse than useless. It\\n', 'is an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are\\n', 'demonstrated to be progressive in character.\\n', '\\n', 'In the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles. Our\\n', 'reasons for this are simple. The strategy of a campaign or of a single\\n', 'battle is a highly technical, and usually a highly controversial, matter\\n', 'about which experts differ widely. In the field of military and naval\\n', 'operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices. To\\n', 'dispose of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is\\n', 'equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs. Any one who\\n', 'compares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign\\n', 'with the account given by Ropes, for instance, will ask for no further\\n', 'comment. No youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think\\n', 'of turning to a high school manual for information about the art of\\n', 'warfare. The dramatic scene or episode, so useful in arousing the\\n', 'interest of the immature pupil, seems out of place in a book that\\n', \"deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's\\n\", 'serious responsibilities.\\n', '\\n', 'It is not upon negative features, however, that we rest our case. It is\\n', 'rather upon constructive features.\\n', '\\n', '_First._ We have written a topical, not a narrative, history. We have\\n', 'tried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of\\n', 'each period, bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration.\\n', '\\n', '_Second._ We have emphasized those historical topics which help to\\n', 'explain how our nation has come to be what it is to-day.\\n', '\\n', '_Third._ We have dwelt fully upon the social and economic aspects of our\\n', 'history, especially in relation to the politics of each period.\\n', '\\n', '_Fourth._ We have treated the causes and results of wars, the problems\\n', 'of financing and sustaining armed forces, rather than military strategy.\\n', 'These are the subjects which belong to a history for civilians. These\\n', 'are matters which civilians can understand--matters which they must\\n', 'understand, if they are to play well their part in war and peace.\\n', '\\n', '_Fifth._ By omitting the period of exploration, we have been able to\\n', 'enlarge the treatment of our own time. We have given special attention\\n', 'to the history of those current questions which must form the subject\\n', 'matter of sound instruction in citizenship.\\n', '\\n', '_Sixth._ We have borne in mind that America, with all her unique\\n', 'characteristics, is a part of a general civilization. Accordingly we\\n', 'have given diplomacy, foreign affairs, world relations, and the\\n', 'reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place.\\n', '\\n', '_Seventh._ We have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity. The\\n', 'study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory. We\\n', 'have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association,\\n', 'reflection, and generalization--habits calculated to enlarge as well as\\n', 'inform the mind. We have been at great pains to make our text clear,\\n', 'simple, and direct; but we have earnestly sought to stretch the\\n', 'intellects of our readers--to put them upon their mettle. Most of them\\n', 'will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school.\\n', 'The world will soon expect maturity from them. Their achievements will\\n', 'depend upon the possession of other powers than memory alone.

THE COLONIAL PERIOD\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER I\\n', '\\n', 'THE GREAT MIGRATION TO AMERICA\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The tide of migration that set in toward the shores of North America\\n', 'during the early years of the seventeenth century was but one phase in\\n', 'the restless and eternal movement of mankind upon the surface of the\\n', 'earth. The ancient Greeks flung out their colonies in every direction,\\n', 'westward as far as Gaul, across the Mediterranean, and eastward into\\n', 'Asia Minor, perhaps to the very confines of India. The Romans, supported\\n', 'by their armies and their government, spread their dominion beyond the\\n', 'narrow lands of Italy until it stretched from the heather of Scotland to\\n', 'the sands of Arabia. The Teutonic tribes, from their home beyond the\\n', 'Danube and the Rhine, poured into the empire of the Caesars and made the\\n', 'beginnings of modern Europe. Of this great sweep of races and empires\\n', 'the settlement of America was merely a part. And it was, moreover, only\\n', 'one aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples, the\\n', 'institutions, and the trade of Europe to the very ends of the earth.\\n', '\\n', 'In one vital point, it must be noted, American colonization differed\\n', 'from that of the ancients. The Greeks usually carried with them\\n', 'affection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the\\n', 'altar of the parent city; but thousands of the immigrants who came to\\n', 'America disliked the state and disowned the church of the mother\\n', 'country. They established compacts of government for themselves and set\\n', 'up altars of their own. They sought not only new soil to till but also\\n', 'political and religious liberty for themselves and their children.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE AGENCIES OF AMERICAN COLONIZATION\\n', '\\n', 'It was no light matter for the English to cross three thousand miles of\\n', 'water and found homes in the American wilderness at the opening of the\\n', 'seventeenth century. Ships, tools, and supplies called for huge outlays\\n', 'of money. Stores had to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain\\n', 'the life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of their own.\\n', 'Artisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk\\n', 'the hazards of the new world. Soldiers were required for defense and\\n', 'mariners for the exploration of inland waters. Leaders of good judgment,\\n', 'adept in managing men, had to be discovered. Altogether such an\\n', 'enterprise demanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or\\n', 'gentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to\\n', 'assume. Though in later days, after initial tests had been made, wealthy\\n', 'proprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account, it was\\n', 'the corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the\\n', 'beginning.\\n', '\\n', '=The Trading Company.=--English pioneers in exploration found an\\n', 'instrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers, which\\n', 'had long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries.\\n', 'Such a corporation was composed of many persons of different ranks of\\n', 'society--noblemen, merchants, and gentlemen--who banded together for a\\n', 'particular undertaking, each contributing a sum of money and sharing in\\n', 'the profits of the venture. It was organized under royal authority; it\\n', 'received its charter, its grant of land, and its trading privileges from\\n', 'the king and carried on its operations under his supervision and\\n', 'control. The charter named all the persons originally included in the\\n', 'corporation and gave them certain powers in the management of its\\n', 'affairs, including the right to admit new members. The company was in\\n', 'fact a little government set up by the king. When the members of the\\n', 'corporation remained in England, as in the case of the Virginia Company,\\n', 'they operated through agents sent to the colony. When they came over the\\n', 'seas themselves and settled in America, as in the case of Massachusetts,\\n', 'they became the direct government of the country they possessed. The\\n', 'stockholders in that instance became the voters and the governor, the\\n', 'chief magistrate.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: JOHN WINTHROP, GOVERNOR OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY\\n', 'COMPANY]\\n', '\\n', 'Four of the thirteen colonies in America owed their origins to the\\n', 'trading corporation. It was the London Company, created by King James I,\\n', 'in 1606, that laid during the following year the foundations of Virginia\\n', 'at Jamestown. It was under the auspices of their West India Company,\\n', 'chartered in 1621, that the Dutch planted the settlements of the New\\n', 'Netherland in the valley of the Hudson. The founders of Massachusetts\\n', 'were Puritan leaders and men of affairs whom King Charles I incorporated\\n', 'in 1629 under the title: \"The governor and company of the Massachusetts\\n', 'Bay in New England.\" In this case the law did but incorporate a group\\n', 'drawn together by religious ties. \"We must be knit together as one man,\"\\n', 'wrote John Winthrop, the first Puritan governor in America. Far to the\\n', 'south, on the banks of the Delaware River, a Swedish commercial company\\n', 'in 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement, christened New Sweden; it\\n', 'was destined to pass under the rule of the Dutch, and finally under the\\n', 'rule of William Penn as the proprietary colony of Delaware.\\n', '\\n', 'In a certain sense, Georgia may be included among the \"company\\n', 'colonies.\" It was, however, originally conceived by the moving spirit,\\n', 'James Oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor men, especially those imprisoned\\n', 'for debt. To realize this humane purpose, he secured from King George\\n', 'II, in 1732, a royal charter uniting several gentlemen, including\\n', 'himself, into \"one body politic and corporate,\" known as the \"Trustees\\n', 'for establishing the colony of Georgia in America.\" In the structure of\\n', 'their organization and their methods of government, the trustees did not\\n', 'differ materially from the regular companies created for trade and\\n', 'colonization. Though their purposes were benevolent, their transactions\\n', 'had to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business.\\n', '\\n', '=The Religious Congregation.=--A second agency which figured largely in\\n', 'the settlement of America was the religious brotherhood, or\\n', 'congregation, of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common\\n', 'religious faith. By one of the strange fortunes of history, this\\n', 'institution, founded in the early days of Christianity, proved to be a\\n', 'potent force in the origin and growth of self-government in a land far\\n', 'away from Galilee. \"And the multitude of them that believed were of one\\n', 'heart and of one soul,\" we are told in the Acts describing the Church at\\n', 'Jerusalem. \"We are knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of\\n', 'the Lord ... by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all\\n', 'care of each other\\'s good and of the whole,\" wrote John Robinson, a\\n', 'leader among the Pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of Plymouth in\\n', '1620. The Mayflower Compact, so famous in American history, was but a\\n', 'written and signed agreement, incorporating the spirit of obedience to\\n', 'the common good, which served as a guide to self-government until\\n', 'Plymouth was annexed to Massachusetts in 1691.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: THE ORIGINAL GRANTS]\\n', '\\n', 'Three other colonies, all of which retained their identity until the eve\\n', 'of the American Revolution, likewise sprang directly from the\\n', 'congregations of the faithful: Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New\\n', 'Hampshire, mainly offshoots from Massachusetts. They were founded by\\n', 'small bodies of men and women, \"united in solemn covenants with the\\n', 'Lord,\" who planted their settlements in the wilderness. Not until many a\\n', 'year after Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson conducted their followers\\n', 'to the Narragansett country was Rhode Island granted a charter of\\n', 'incorporation (1663) by the crown. Not until long after the congregation\\n', 'of Thomas Hooker from Newtown blazed the way into the Connecticut River\\n', 'Valley did the king of England give Connecticut a charter of its own\\n', '(1662) and a place among the colonies. Half a century elapsed before the\\n', 'towns laid out beyond the Merrimac River by emigrants from Massachusetts\\n', 'were formed into the royal province of New Hampshire in 1679.\\n', '\\n', 'Even when Connecticut was chartered, the parchment and sealing wax of\\n', 'the royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of self-government\\n', 'and obedience to law previously established by the congregations. The\\n', 'towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield had long lived happily\\n', 'under their \"Fundamental Orders\" drawn up by themselves in 1639; so had\\n', 'the settlers dwelt peacefully at New Haven under their \"Fundamental\\n', 'Articles\" drafted in the same year. The pioneers on the Connecticut\\n', 'shore had no difficulty in agreeing that \"the Scriptures do hold forth a\\n', 'perfect rule for the direction and government of all men.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Proprietor.=--A third and very important colonial agency was the\\n', 'proprietor, or proprietary. As the name, associated with the word\\n', '\"property,\" implies, the proprietor was a person to whom the king\\n', 'granted property in lands in North America to have, hold, use, and enjoy\\n', 'for his own benefit and profit, with the right to hand the estate down\\n', 'to his heirs in perpetual succession. The proprietor was a rich and\\n', 'powerful person, prepared to furnish or secure the capital, collect the\\n', 'ships, supply the stores, and assemble the settlers necessary to found\\n', 'and sustain a plantation beyond the seas. Sometimes the proprietor\\n', 'worked alone. Sometimes two or more were associated like partners in the\\n', 'common undertaking.\\n', '\\n', 'Five colonies, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Carolinas,\\n', 'owe their formal origins, though not always their first settlements, nor\\n', 'in most cases their prosperity, to the proprietary system. Maryland,\\n', 'established in 1634 under a Catholic nobleman, Lord Baltimore, and\\n', 'blessed with religious toleration by the act of 1649, flourished under\\n', 'the mild rule of proprietors until it became a state in the American\\n', 'union. New Jersey, beginning its career under two proprietors, Berkeley\\n', 'and Carteret, in 1664, passed under the direct government of the crown\\n', 'in 1702. Pennsylvania was, in a very large measure, the product of the\\n', 'generous spirit and tireless labors of its first proprietor, the leader\\n', 'of the Friends, William Penn, to whom it was granted in 1681 and in\\n', 'whose family it remained until 1776. The two Carolinas were first\\n', 'organized as one colony in 1663 under the government and patronage of\\n', 'eight proprietors, including Lord Clarendon; but after more than half a\\n', 'century both became royal provinces governed by the king.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: WILLIAM PENN, PROPRIETOR OF PENNSYLVANIA]\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE COLONIAL PEOPLES\\n', '\\n', '=The English.=--In leadership and origin the thirteen colonies, except\\n', 'New York and Delaware, were English. During the early days of all, save\\n', 'these two, the main, if not the sole, current of immigration was from\\n', 'England. The colonists came from every walk of life. They were men,\\n', 'women, and children of \"all sorts and conditions.\" The major portion\\n', 'were yeomen, or small land owners, farm laborers, and artisans. With\\n', 'them were merchants and gentlemen who brought their stocks of goods or\\n', 'their fortunes to the New World. Scholars came from Oxford and\\n', 'Cambridge to preach the gospel or to teach. Now and then the son of an\\n', 'English nobleman left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with\\n', 'America. The people represented every religious faith--members of the\\n', 'Established Church of England; Puritans who had labored to reform that\\n', 'church; Separatists, Baptists, and Friends, who had left it altogether;\\n', 'and Catholics, who clung to the religion of their fathers.\\n', '\\n', 'New England was almost purely English. During the years between 1629 and\\n', '1640, the period of arbitrary Stuart government, about twenty thousand\\n', 'Puritans emigrated to America, settling in the colonies of the far\\n', 'North. Although minor additions were made from time to time, the greater\\n', 'portion of the New England people sprang from this original stock.\\n', 'Virginia, too, for a long time drew nearly all her immigrants from\\n', 'England alone. Not until the eve of the Revolution did other\\n', 'nationalities, mainly the Scotch-Irish and Germans, rival the English in\\n', 'numbers.\\n', '\\n', 'The populations of later English colonies--the Carolinas, New York,\\n', 'Pennsylvania, and Georgia--while receiving a steady stream of\\n', 'immigration from England, were constantly augmented by wanderers from\\n', 'the older settlements. New York was invaded by Puritans from New England\\n', 'in such numbers as to cause the Anglican clergymen there to lament that\\n', '\"free thinking spreads almost as fast as the Church.\" North Carolina was\\n', 'first settled toward the northern border by immigrants from Virginia.\\n', 'Some of the North Carolinians, particularly the Quakers, came all the\\n', 'way from New England, tarrying in Virginia only long enough to learn how\\n', 'little they were wanted in that Anglican colony.\\n', '\\n', '=The Scotch-Irish.=--Next to the English in numbers and influence were\\n', 'the Scotch-Irish, Presbyterians in belief, English in tongue. Both\\n', 'religious and economic reasons sent them across the sea. Their Scotch\\n', 'ancestors, in the days of Cromwell, had settled in the north of Ireland\\n', \"whence the native Irish had been driven by the conqueror's sword. There\\n\", 'the Scotch nourished for many years enjoying in peace their own form of\\n', 'religion and growing prosperous in the manufacture of fine linen and\\n', 'woolen cloth. Then the blow fell. Toward the end of the seventeenth\\n', 'century their religious worship was put under the ban and the export of\\n', 'their cloth was forbidden by the English Parliament. Within two decades\\n', 'twenty thousand Scotch-Irish left Ulster alone, for America; and all\\n', 'during the eighteenth century the migration continued to be heavy.\\n', 'Although no exact record was kept, it is reckoned that the Scotch-Irish\\n', 'and the Scotch who came directly from Scotland, composed one-sixth of\\n', 'the entire American population on the eve of the Revolution.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: SETTLEMENTS OF GERMAN AND SCOTCH-IRISH\\n', 'IMMIGRANTS]\\n', '\\n', 'These newcomers in America made their homes chiefly in New Jersey,\\n', 'Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Coming late upon\\n', 'the scene, they found much of the land immediately upon the seaboard\\n', 'already taken up. For this reason most of them became frontier people\\n', 'settling the interior and upland regions. There they cleared the land,\\n', 'laid out their small farms, and worked as \"sturdy yeomen on the soil,\"\\n', 'hardy, industrious, and independent in spirit, sharing neither the\\n', 'luxuries of the rich planters nor the easy life of the leisurely\\n', 'merchants. To their agriculture they added woolen and linen\\n', 'manufactures, which, flourishing in the supple fingers of their tireless\\n', 'women, made heavy inroads upon the trade of the English merchants in\\n', 'the colonies. Of their labors a poet has sung:\\n', '\\n', '        \"O, willing hands to toil;\\n', '    Strong natures tuned to the harvest-song and bound to the kindly soil;\\n', '    Bold pioneers for the wilderness, defenders in the field.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Germans.=--Third among the colonists in order of numerical\\n', 'importance were the Germans. From the very beginning, they appeared in\\n', 'colonial records. A number of the artisans and carpenters in the first\\n', 'Jamestown colony were of German descent. Peter Minuit, the famous\\n', 'governor of New Motherland, was a German from Wesel on the Rhine, and\\n', 'Jacob Leisler, leader of a popular uprising against the provincial\\n', 'administration of New York, was a German from Frankfort-on-Main. The\\n', 'wholesale migration of Germans began with the founding of Pennsylvania.\\n', 'Penn was diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to cultivate his\\n', 'lands and he made a special effort to attract peasants from the Rhine\\n', 'country. A great association, known as the Frankfort Company, bought\\n', 'more than twenty thousand acres from him and in 1684 established a\\n', 'center at Germantown for the distribution of German immigrants. In old\\n', 'New York, Rhinebeck-on-the-Hudson became a similar center for\\n', 'distribution. All the way from Maine to Georgia inducements were offered\\n', 'to the German farmers and in nearly every colony were to be found, in\\n', 'time, German settlements. In fact the migration became so large that\\n', 'German princes were frightened at the loss of so many subjects and\\n', 'England was alarmed by the influx of foreigners into her overseas\\n', 'dominions. Yet nothing could stop the movement. By the end of the\\n', 'colonial period, the number of Germans had risen to more than two\\n', 'hundred thousand.\\n', '\\n', 'The majority of them were Protestants from the Rhine region, and South\\n', 'Germany. Wars, religious controversies, oppression, and poverty drove\\n', 'them forth to America. Though most of them were farmers, there were also\\n', 'among them skilled artisans who contributed to the rapid growth of\\n', 'industries in Pennsylvania. Their iron, glass, paper, and woolen mills,\\n', 'dotted here and there among the thickly settled regions, added to the\\n', 'wealth and independence of the province.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', 'A GLIMPSE OF OLD GERMANTOWN]\\n', '\\n', 'Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans did not speak the language of the\\n', 'original colonists or mingle freely with them. They kept to themselves,\\n', 'built their own schools, founded their own newspapers, and published\\n', 'their own books. Their clannish habits often irritated their neighbors\\n', 'and led to occasional agitations against \"foreigners.\" However, no\\n', 'serious collisions seem to have occurred; and in the days of the\\n', 'Revolution, German soldiers from Pennsylvania fought in the patriot\\n', 'armies side by side with soldiers from the English and Scotch-Irish\\n', 'sections.\\n', '\\n', '=Other Nationalities.=--Though the English, the Scotch-Irish, and the\\n', 'Germans made up the bulk of the colonial population, there were other\\n', 'racial strains as well, varying in numerical importance but contributing\\n', 'their share to colonial life.\\n', '\\n', 'From France came the Huguenots fleeing from the decree of the king which\\n', 'inflicted terrible penalties upon Protestants.\\n', '\\n', 'From \"Old Ireland\" came thousands of native Irish, Celtic in race and\\n', 'Catholic in religion. Like their Scotch-Irish neighbors to the north,\\n', 'they revered neither the government nor the church of England imposed\\n', 'upon them by the sword. How many came we do not know, but shipping\\n', 'records of the colonial period show that boatload after boatload left\\n', 'the southern and eastern shores of Ireland for the New World.\\n', 'Undoubtedly thousands of their passengers were Irish of the native\\n', 'stock. This surmise is well sustained by the constant appearance of\\n', 'Celtic names in the records of various colonies.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration:_From an old print_\\n', '\\n', 'OLD DUTCH FORT AND ENGLISH CHURCH NEAR ALBANY]\\n', '\\n', 'The Jews, then as ever engaged in their age-long battle for religious\\n', 'and economic toleration, found in the American colonies, not complete\\n', 'liberty, but certainly more freedom than they enjoyed in England,\\n', 'France, Spain, or Portugal. The English law did not actually recognize\\n', 'their right to live in any of the dominions, but owing to the easy-going\\n', 'habits of the Americans they were allowed to filter into the seaboard\\n', 'towns. The treatment they received there varied. On one occasion the\\n', 'mayor and council of New York forbade them to sell by retail and on\\n', 'another prohibited the exercise of their religious worship. Newport,\\n', 'Philadelphia, and Charleston were more hospitable, and there large\\n', 'Jewish colonies, consisting principally of merchants and their families,\\n', 'flourished in spite of nominal prohibitions of the law.\\n', '\\n', 'Though the small Swedish colony in Delaware was quickly submerged\\n', 'beneath the tide of English migration, the Dutch in New York continued\\n', 'to hold their own for more than a hundred years after the English\\n', 'conquest in 1664. At the end of the colonial period over one-half of the\\n', '170,000 inhabitants of the province were descendants of the original\\n', 'Dutch--still distinct enough to give a decided cast to the life and\\n', 'manners of New York. Many of them clung as tenaciously to their mother\\n', 'tongue as they did to their capacious farmhouses or their Dutch ovens;\\n', 'but they were slowly losing their identity as the English pressed in\\n', 'beside them to farm and trade.\\n', '\\n', 'The melting pot had begun its historic mission.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION\\n', '\\n', 'Considered from one side, colonization, whatever the motives of the\\n', 'emigrants, was an economic matter. It involved the use of capital to pay\\n', 'for their passage, to sustain them on the voyage, and to start them on\\n', 'the way of production. Under this stern economic necessity, Puritans,\\n', 'Scotch-Irish, Germans, and all were alike laid.\\n', '\\n', '=Immigrants Who Paid Their Own Way.=--Many of the immigrants to America\\n', 'in colonial days were capitalists themselves, in a small or a large way,\\n', 'and paid their own passage. What proportion of the colonists were able\\n', 'to finance their voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conjecture.\\n', 'Undoubtedly a very considerable number could do so, for we can trace the\\n', 'family fortunes of many early settlers. Henry Cabot Lodge is authority\\n', 'for the statement that \"the settlers of New England were drawn from the\\n', 'country gentlemen, small farmers, and yeomanry of the mother\\n', 'country.... Many of the emigrants were men of wealth, as the old lists\\n', 'show, and all of them, with few exceptions, were men of property and\\n', 'good standing. They did not belong to the classes from which emigration\\n', 'is usually supplied, for they all had a stake in the country they left\\n', 'behind.\" Though it would be interesting to know how accurate this\\n', 'statement is or how applicable to the other colonies, no study has as\\n', 'yet been made to gratify that interest. For the present it is an\\n', 'unsolved problem just how many of the colonists were able to bear the\\n', 'cost of their own transfer to the New World.\\n', '\\n', '=Indentured Servants.=--That at least tens of thousands of immigrants\\n', 'were unable to pay for their passage is established beyond the shadow of\\n', 'a doubt by the shipping records that have come down to us. The great\\n', 'barrier in the way of the poor who wanted to go to America was the cost\\n', 'of the sea voyage. To overcome this difficulty a plan was worked out\\n', 'whereby shipowners and other persons of means furnished the passage\\n', 'money to immigrants in return for their promise, or bond, to work for a\\n', 'term of years to repay the sum advanced. This system was called\\n', 'indentured servitude.\\n', '\\n', 'It is probable that the number of bond servants exceeded the original\\n', 'twenty thousand Puritans, the yeomen, the Virginia gentlemen, and the\\n', 'Huguenots combined. All the way down the coast from Massachusetts to\\n', 'Georgia were to be found in the fields, kitchens, and workshops, men,\\n', 'women, and children serving out terms of bondage generally ranging from\\n', 'five to seven years. In the proprietary colonies the proportion of bond\\n', 'servants was very high. The Baltimores, Penns, Carterets, and other\\n', 'promoters anxiously sought for workers of every nationality to till\\n', 'their fields, for land without labor was worth no more than land in the\\n', 'moon. Hence the gates of the proprietary colonies were flung wide open.\\n', 'Every inducement was offered to immigrants in the form of cheap land,\\n', 'and special efforts were made to increase the population by importing\\n', 'servants. In Pennsylvania, it was not uncommon to find a master with\\n', 'fifty bond servants on his estate. It has been estimated that two-thirds\\n', 'of all the immigrants into Pennsylvania between the opening of the\\n', 'eighteenth century and the outbreak of the Revolution were in bondage.\\n', 'In the other Middle colonies the number was doubtless not so large; but\\n', 'it formed a considerable part of the population.\\n', '\\n', 'The story of this traffic in white servants is one of the most striking\\n', 'things in the history of labor. Bondmen differed from the serfs of the\\n', 'feudal age in that they were not bound to the soil but to the master.\\n', 'They likewise differed from the negro slaves in that their servitude had\\n', 'a time limit. Still they were subject to many special disabilities. It\\n', 'was, for instance, a common practice to impose on them penalties far\\n', 'heavier than were imposed upon freemen for the same offense. A free\\n', 'citizen of Pennsylvania who indulged in horse racing and gambling was\\n', 'let off with a fine; a white servant guilty of the same unlawful conduct\\n', 'was whipped at the post and fined as well.\\n', '\\n', 'The ordinary life of the white servant was also severely restricted. A\\n', \"bondman could not marry without his master's consent; nor engage in\\n\", 'trade; nor refuse work assigned to him. For an attempt to escape or\\n', 'indeed for any infraction of the law, the term of service was extended.\\n', 'The condition of white bondmen in Virginia, according to Lodge, \"was\\n', 'little better than that of slaves. Loose indentures and harsh laws put\\n', 'them at the mercy of their masters.\" It would not be unfair to add that\\n', 'such was their lot in all other colonies. Their fate depended upon the\\n', 'temper of their masters.\\n', '\\n', 'Cruel as was the system in many ways, it gave thousands of people in the\\n', 'Old World a chance to reach the New--an opportunity to wrestle with fate\\n', 'for freedom and a home of their own. When their weary years of servitude\\n', 'were over, if they survived, they might obtain land of their own or\\n', 'settle as free mechanics in the towns. For many a bondman the gamble\\n', 'proved to be a losing venture because he found himself unable to rise\\n', 'out of the state of poverty and dependence into which his servitude\\n', 'carried him. For thousands, on the contrary, bondage proved to be a real\\n', 'avenue to freedom and prosperity. Some of the best citizens of America\\n', 'have the blood of indentured servants in their veins.\\n', '\\n', '=The Transported--Involuntary Servitude.=--In their anxiety to secure\\n', 'settlers, the companies and proprietors having colonies in America\\n', 'either resorted to or connived at the practice of kidnapping men, women,\\n', 'and children from the streets of English cities. In 1680 it was\\n', 'officially estimated that \"ten thousand persons were spirited away\" to\\n', 'America. Many of the victims of the practice were young children, for\\n', 'the traffic in them was highly profitable. Orphans and dependents were\\n', 'sometimes disposed of in America by relatives unwilling to support them.\\n', 'In a single year, 1627, about fifteen hundred children were shipped to\\n', 'Virginia.\\n', '\\n', 'In this gruesome business there lurked many tragedies, and very few\\n', 'romances. Parents were separated from their children and husbands from\\n', 'their wives. Hundreds of skilled artisans--carpenters, smiths, and\\n', 'weavers--utterly disappeared as if swallowed up by death. A few thus\\n', 'dragged off to the New World to be sold into servitude for a term of\\n', 'five or seven years later became prosperous and returned home with\\n', 'fortunes. In one case a young man who was forcibly carried over the sea\\n', 'lived to make his way back to England and establish his claim to a\\n', 'peerage.\\n', '\\n', 'Akin to the kidnapped, at least in economic position, were convicts\\n', 'deported to the colonies for life in lieu of fines and imprisonment. The\\n', 'Americans protested vigorously but ineffectually against this practice.\\n', 'Indeed, they exaggerated its evils, for many of the \"criminals\" were\\n', 'only mild offenders against unduly harsh and cruel laws. A peasant\\n', \"caught shooting a rabbit on a lord's estate or a luckless servant girl\\n\", 'who purloined a pocket handkerchief was branded as a criminal along with\\n', 'sturdy thieves and incorrigible rascals. Other transported offenders\\n', 'were \"political criminals\"; that is, persons who criticized or opposed\\n', 'the government. This class included now Irish who revolted against\\n', 'British rule in Ireland; now Cavaliers who championed the king against\\n', 'the Puritan revolutionists; Puritans, in turn, dispatched after the\\n', 'monarchy was restored; and Scotch and English subjects in general who\\n', 'joined in political uprisings against the king.\\n', '\\n', '=The African Slaves.=--Rivaling in numbers, in the course of time, the\\n', 'indentured servants and whites carried to America against their will\\n', 'were the African negroes brought to America and sold into slavery. When\\n', 'this form of bondage was first introduced into Virginia in 1619, it was\\n', 'looked upon as a temporary necessity to be discarded with the increase\\n', 'of the white population. Moreover it does not appear that those planters\\n', 'who first bought negroes at the auction block intended to establish a\\n', 'system of permanent bondage. Only by a slow process did chattel slavery\\n', 'take firm root and become recognized as the leading source of the labor\\n', 'supply. In 1650, thirty years after the introduction of slavery, there\\n', 'were only three hundred Africans in Virginia.\\n', '\\n', 'The great increase in later years was due in no small measure to the\\n', 'inordinate zeal for profits that seized slave traders both in Old and in\\n', 'New England. Finding it relatively easy to secure negroes in Africa,\\n', 'they crowded the Southern ports with their vessels. The English Royal\\n', 'African Company sent to America annually between 1713 and 1743 from five\\n', 'to ten thousand slaves. The ship owners of New England were not far\\n', 'behind their English brethren in pushing this extraordinary traffic.\\n', '\\n', 'As the proportion of the negroes to the free white population steadily\\n', 'rose, and as whole sections were overrun with slaves and slave traders,\\n', 'the Southern colonies grew alarmed. In 1710, Virginia sought to curtail\\n', 'the importation by placing a duty of $5 on each slave. This effort was\\n', 'futile, for the royal governor promptly vetoed it. From time to time\\n', 'similar bills were passed, only to meet with royal disapproval. South\\n', 'Carolina, in 1760, absolutely prohibited importation; but the measure\\n', 'was killed by the British crown. As late as 1772, Virginia, not daunted\\n', 'by a century of rebuffs, sent to George III a petition in this vein:\\n', '\"The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of Africa\\n', 'hath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity and under its\\n', 'present encouragement, we have too much reason to fear, will endanger\\n', \"the very existence of Your Majesty's American dominions.... Deeply\\n\", 'impressed with these sentiments, we most humbly beseech Your Majesty to\\n', \"remove all those restraints on Your Majesty's governors of this colony\\n\", 'which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very\\n', 'pernicious a commerce.\"\\n', '\\n', 'All such protests were without avail. The negro population grew by leaps\\n', 'and bounds, until on the eve of the Revolution it amounted to more than\\n', 'half a million. In five states--Maryland, Virginia, the two Carolinas,\\n', 'and Georgia--the slaves nearly equalled or actually exceeded the whites\\n', 'in number. In South Carolina they formed almost two-thirds of the\\n', 'population. Even in the Middle colonies of Delaware and Pennsylvania\\n', 'about one-fifth of the inhabitants were from Africa. To the North, the\\n', 'proportion of slaves steadily diminished although chattel servitude was\\n', 'on the same legal footing as in the South. In New York approximately one\\n', 'in six and in New England one in fifty were negroes, including a few\\n', 'freedmen.\\n', '\\n', 'The climate, the soil, the commerce, and the industry of the North were\\n', 'all unfavorable to the growth of a servile population. Still, slavery,\\n', 'though sectional, was a part of the national system of economy. Northern\\n', 'ships carried slaves to the Southern colonies and the produce of the\\n', 'plantations to Europe. \"If the Northern states will consult their\\n', 'interest, they will not oppose the increase in slaves which will\\n', 'increase the commodities of which they will become the carriers,\" said\\n', 'John Rutledge, of South Carolina, in the convention which framed the\\n', 'Constitution of the United States. \"What enriches a part enriches the\\n', 'whole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest,\"\\n', 'responded Oliver Ellsworth, the distinguished spokesman of Connecticut.\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', 'E.

The feudal and\\n', 'aristocratic societies of Europe were founded on a system of landlordism\\n', 'which was characterized by two distinct features. In the first place,\\n', 'the land was nearly all held in great estates, each owned by a single\\n', 'proprietor. In the second place, every estate was kept intact under the\\n', 'law of primogeniture, which at the death of a lord transferred all his\\n', 'landed property to his eldest son. This prevented the subdivision of\\n', 'estates and the growth of a large body of small farmers or freeholders\\n', 'owning their own land. It made a form of tenantry or servitude\\n', 'inevitable for the mass of those who labored on the land. It also\\n', 'enabled the landlords to maintain themselves in power as a governing\\n', 'class and kept the tenants and laborers subject to their economic and\\n', 'political control. If land tenure was so significant in Europe, it was\\n', 'equally important in the development of America, where practically all\\n', 'the first immigrants were forced by circumstances to derive their\\n', 'livelihood from the soil.\\n', '\\n', '=Experiments in Common Tillage.=--In the New World, with its broad\\n', \"extent of land awaiting the white man's plow, it was impossible to\\n\", 'introduce in its entirety and over the whole area the system of lords\\n', 'and tenants that existed across the sea. So it happened that almost\\n', 'every kind of experiment in land tenure, from communism to feudalism,\\n', 'was tried. In the early days of the Jamestown colony, the land, though\\n', 'owned by the London Company, was tilled in common by the settlers. No\\n', 'man had a separate plot of his own. The motto of the community was:\\n', '\"Labor and share alike.\" All were supposed to work in the fields and\\n', 'receive an equal share of the produce. At Plymouth, the Pilgrims\\n', 'attempted a similar experiment, laying out the fields in common and\\n', 'distributing the joint produce of their labor with rough equality among\\n', 'the workers.\\n', '\\n', 'In both colonies the communistic experiments were failures. Angry at the\\n', 'lazy men in Jamestown who idled their time away and yet expected regular\\n', 'meals, Captain John Smith issued a manifesto: \"Everyone that gathereth\\n', 'not every day as much as I do, the next day shall be set beyond the\\n', 'river and forever banished from the fort and live there or starve.\" Even\\n', 'this terrible threat did not bring a change in production. Not until\\n', 'each man was given a plot of his own to till, not until each gathered\\n', 'the fruits of his own labor, did the colony prosper. In Plymouth, where\\n', 'the communal experiment lasted for five years, the results were similar\\n', 'to those in Virginia, and the system was given up for one of separate\\n', 'fields in which every person could \"set corn for his own particular.\"\\n', 'Some other New England towns, refusing to profit by the experience of\\n', 'their Plymouth neighbor, also made excursions into common ownership and\\n', 'labor, only to abandon the idea and go in for individual ownership of\\n', 'the land. \"By degrees it was seen that even the Lord\\'s people could not\\n', 'carry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome\\n', 'practice.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Feudal Elements in the Colonies--Quit Rents, Manors, and\\n', 'Plantations.=--At the other end of the scale were the feudal elements of\\n', 'land tenure found in the proprietary colonies, in the seaboard regions\\n', 'of the South, and to some extent in New York. The proprietor was in fact\\n', 'a powerful feudal lord, owning land granted to him by royal charter. He\\n', 'could retain any part of it for his personal use or dispose of it all in\\n', 'large or small lots. While he generally kept for himself an estate of\\n', 'baronial proportions, it was impossible for him to manage directly any\\n', 'considerable part of the land in his dominion. Consequently he either\\n', 'sold it in parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals on\\n', 'condition that they make to him an annual payment in money, known as\\n', '\"quit rent.\" In Maryland, the proprietor sometimes collected as high as\\n', '$9000 (equal to about $500,000 to-day) in a single year from this\\n', 'source. In Pennsylvania, the quit rents brought a handsome annual\\n', 'tribute into the exchequer of the Penn family. In the royal provinces,\\n', 'the king of England claimed all revenues collected in this form from the\\n', 'land, a sum amounting to $19,000 at the time of the Revolution. The quit\\n', 'rent,--\"really a feudal payment from freeholders,\"--was thus a material\\n', 'source of income for the crown as well as for the proprietors. Wherever\\n', 'it was laid, however, it proved to be a burden, a source of constant\\n', 'irritation; and it became a formidable item in the long list of\\n', 'grievances which led to the American Revolution.\\n', '\\n', 'Something still more like the feudal system of the Old World appeared in\\n', 'the numerous manors or the huge landed estates granted by the crown, the\\n', 'companies, or the proprietors. In the colony of Maryland alone there\\n', 'were sixty manors of three thousand acres each, owned by wealthy men and\\n', 'tilled by tenants holding small plots under certain restrictions of\\n', 'tenure. In New York also there were many manors of wide extent, most of\\n', 'which originated in the days of the Dutch West India Company, when\\n', 'extensive concessions were made to patroons to induce them to bring over\\n', 'settlers. The Van Rensselaer, the Van Cortlandt, and the Livingston\\n', 'manors were so large and populous that each was entitled to send a\\n', 'representative to the provincial legislature. The tenants on the New\\n', 'York manors were in somewhat the same position as serfs on old European\\n', 'estates. They were bound to pay the owner a rent in money and kind; they\\n', 'ground their grain at his mill; and they were subject to his judicial\\n', 'power because he held court and meted out justice, in some instances\\n', 'extending to capital punishment.\\n', '\\n', 'The manors of New York or Maryland were, however, of slight consequence\\n', 'as compared with the vast plantations of the Southern seaboard--huge\\n', 'estates, far wider in expanse than many a European barony and tilled by\\n', 'slaves more servile than any feudal tenants. It must not be forgotten\\n', 'that this system of land tenure became the dominant feature of a large\\n', 'section and gave a decided bent to the economic and political life of\\n', 'America.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: SOUTHERN PLANTATION MANSION]\\n', '\\n', '=The Small Freehold.=--In the upland regions of the South, however, and\\n', 'throughout most of the North, the drift was against all forms of\\n', 'servitude and tenantry and in the direction of the freehold; that is,\\n', 'the small farm owned outright and tilled by the possessor and his\\n', 'family. This was favored by natural circumstances and the spirit of the\\n', 'immigrants. For one thing, the abundance of land and the scarcity of\\n', 'labor made it impossible for the companies, the proprietors, or the\\n', 'crown to develop over the whole continent a network of vast estates. In\\n', 'many sections, particularly in New England, the climate, the stony soil,\\n', 'the hills, and the narrow valleys conspired to keep the farms within a\\n', 'moderate compass. For another thing, the English, Scotch-Irish, and\\n', 'German peasants, even if they had been tenants in the Old World, did not\\n', 'propose to accept permanent dependency of any kind in the New. If they\\n', 'could not get freeholds, they would not settle at all; thus they forced\\n', 'proprietors and companies to bid for their enterprise by selling land in\\n', 'small lots. So it happened that the freehold of modest proportions\\n', 'became the cherished unit of American farmers. The people who tilled the\\n', 'farms were drawn from every quarter of western Europe; but the freehold\\n', 'system gave a uniform cast to their economic and social life in America.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', 'A NEW ENGLAND FARMHOUSE]\\n', '\\n', '=Social Effects of Land Tenure.=--Land tenure and the process of western\\n', 'settlement thus developed two distinct types of people engaged in the\\n', 'same pursuit--agriculture. They had a common tie in that they both\\n', 'cultivated the soil and possessed the local interest and independence\\n', 'which arise from that occupation. Their methods and their culture,\\n', 'however, differed widely.\\n', '\\n', 'The Southern planter, on his broad acres tilled by slaves, resembled the\\n', 'English landlord on his estates more than he did the colonial farmer who\\n', 'labored with his own hands in the fields and forests. He sold his rice\\n', 'and tobacco in large amounts directly to English factors, who took his\\n', 'entire crop in exchange for goods and cash. His fine clothes,\\n', 'silverware, china, and cutlery he bought in English markets. Loving the\\n', 'ripe old culture of the mother country, he often sent his sons to Oxford\\n', 'or Cambridge for their education. In short, he depended very largely for\\n', 'his prosperity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations with the\\n', 'Old World. He did not even need market towns in which to buy native\\n', 'goods, for they were made on his own plantation by his own artisans who\\n', 'were usually gifted slaves.\\n', '\\n', 'The economic condition of the small farmer was totally different. His\\n', 'crops were not big enough to warrant direct connection with English\\n', 'factors or the personal maintenance of a corps of artisans. He needed\\n', 'local markets, and they sprang up to meet the need. Smiths, hatters,\\n', 'weavers, wagon-makers, and potters at neighboring towns supplied him\\n', 'with the rough products of their native skill. The finer goods, bought\\n', 'by the rich planter in England, the small farmer ordinarily could not\\n', 'buy. His wants were restricted to staples like tea and sugar, and\\n', 'between him and the European market stood the merchant. His community\\n', 'was therefore more self-sufficient than the seaboard line of great\\n', 'plantations. It was more isolated, more provincial, more independent,\\n', 'more American. The planter faced the Old East. The farmer faced the New\\n', 'West.\\n', '\\n', '=The Westward Movement.=--Yeoman and planter nevertheless were alike in\\n', 'one respect. Their land hunger was never appeased. Each had the eye of\\n', 'an expert for new and fertile soil; and so, north and south, as soon as\\n', 'a foothold was secured on the Atlantic coast, the current of migration\\n', 'set in westward, creeping through forests, across rivers, and over\\n', 'mountains. Many of the later immigrants, in their search for cheap\\n', 'lands, were compelled to go to the border; but in a large part the path\\n', 'breakers to the West were native Americans of the second and third\\n', 'generations. Explorers, fired by curiosity and the lure of the\\n', 'mysterious unknown, and hunters, fur traders, and squatters, following\\n', 'their own sweet wills, blazed the trail, opening paths and sending back\\n', 'stories of the new regions they traversed. Then came the regular\\n', 'settlers with lawful titles to the lands they had purchased, sometimes\\n', 'singly and sometimes in companies.\\n', '\\n', 'In Massachusetts, the westward movement is recorded in the founding of\\n', 'Springfield in 1636 and Great Barrington in 1725. By the opening of the\\n', 'eighteenth century the pioneers of Connecticut had pushed north and west\\n', 'until their outpost towns adjoined the Hudson Valley settlements. In New\\n', 'York, the inland movement was directed by the Hudson River to Albany,\\n', 'and from that old Dutch center it radiated in every direction,\\n', 'particularly westward through the Mohawk Valley. New Jersey was early\\n', 'filled to its borders, the beginnings of the present city of New\\n', 'Brunswick being made in 1681 and those of Trenton in 1685. In\\n', 'Pennsylvania, as in New York, the waterways determined the main lines of\\n', 'advance. Pioneers, pushing up through the valley of the Schuylkill,\\n', 'spread over the fertile lands of Berks and Lancaster counties, laying\\n', 'out Reading in 1748. Another current of migration was directed by the\\n', 'Susquehanna, and, in 1726, the first farmhouse was built on the bank\\n', 'where Harrisburg was later founded. Along the southern tier of counties\\n', 'a thin line of settlements stretched westward to Pittsburgh, reaching\\n', 'the upper waters of the Ohio while the colony was still under the Penn\\n', 'family.\\n', '\\n', 'In the South the westward march was equally swift. The seaboard was\\n', 'quickly occupied by large planters and their slaves engaged in the\\n', 'cultivation of tobacco and rice. The Piedmont Plateau, lying back from\\n', 'the coast all the way from Maryland to Georgia, was fed by two streams\\n', 'of migration, one westward from the sea and the other southward from the\\n', 'other colonies--Germans from Pennsylvania and Scotch-Irish furnishing\\n', 'the main supply. \"By 1770, tide-water Virginia was full to overflowing\\n', \"and the 'back country' of the Blue Ridge and the Shenandoah was fully\\n\", 'occupied. Even the mountain valleys ... were claimed by sturdy pioneers.\\n', 'Before the Declaration of Independence, the oncoming tide of\\n', 'home-seekers had reached the crest of the Alleghanies.\"\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, 1790]\\n', '\\n', 'Beyond the mountains pioneers had already ventured, harbingers of an\\n', 'invasion that was about to break in upon Kentucky and Tennessee. As\\n', 'early as 1769 that mighty Nimrod, Daniel Boone, curious to hunt\\n', 'buffaloes, of which he had heard weird reports, passed through the\\n', 'Cumberland Gap and brought back news of a wonderful country awaiting the\\n', 'plow. A hint was sufficient. Singly, in pairs, and in groups, settlers\\n', 'followed the trail he had blazed. A great land corporation, the\\n', 'Transylvania Company, emulating the merchant adventurers of earlier\\n', 'times, secured a huge grant of territory and sought profits in quit\\n', 'rents from lands sold to farmers. By the outbreak of the Revolution\\n', 'there were several hundred people in the Kentucky region. Like the older\\n', 'colonists, they did not relish quit rents, and their opposition wrecked\\n', 'the Transylvania Company. They even carried their protests into the\\n', 'Continental Congress in 1776, for by that time they were our \"embryo\\n', 'fourteenth colony.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT\\n', '\\n', 'Though the labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming, there was\\n', 'a steady growth in industrial and commercial pursuits. Most of the\\n', 'staple industries of to-day, not omitting iron and textiles, have their\\n', 'beginnings in colonial times. Manufacturing and trade soon gave rise to\\n', 'towns which enjoyed an importance all out of proportion to their\\n', 'numbers. The great centers of commerce and finance on the seaboard\\n', 'originated in the days when the king of England was \"lord of these\\n', 'dominions.\"\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: DOMESTIC INDUSTRY: DIPPING TALLOW CANDLES]\\n', '\\n', '=Textile Manufacture as a Domestic Industry.=--Colonial women, in\\n', 'addition to sharing every hardship of pioneering, often the heavy labor\\n', 'of the open field, developed in the course of time a national industry\\n', 'which was almost exclusively their own. Wool and flax were raised in\\n', 'abundance in the North and South. \"Every farm house,\" says Coman, the\\n', 'economic historian, \"was a workshop where the women spun and wove the\\n', 'serges, kerseys, and linsey-woolseys which served for the common wear.\"\\n', 'By the close of the seventeenth century, New England manufactured cloth\\n', 'in sufficient quantities to export it to the Southern colonies and to\\n', 'the West Indies. As the industry developed, mills were erected for the\\n', 'more difficult process of dyeing, weaving, and fulling, but carding and\\n', 'spinning continued to be done in the home. The Dutch of New Netherland,\\n', 'the Swedes of Delaware, and the Scotch-Irish of the interior \"were not\\n', 'one whit behind their Yankee neighbors.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The importance of this enterprise to British economic life can hardly be\\n', 'overestimated. For many a century the English had employed their fine\\n', 'woolen cloth as the chief staple in a lucrative foreign trade, and the\\n', 'government had come to look upon it as an object of special interest and\\n', 'protection. When the colonies were established, both merchants and\\n', 'statesmen naturally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasing value;\\n', 'but before long the Americans, instead of buying cloth, especially of\\n', 'the coarser varieties, were making it to sell. In the place of\\n', 'customers, here were rivals. In the place of helpless reliance upon\\n', 'English markets, here was the germ of economic independence.\\n', '\\n', 'If British merchants had not discovered it in the ordinary course of\\n', 'trade, observant officers in the provinces would have conveyed the news\\n', 'to them. Even in the early years of the eighteenth century the royal\\n', 'governor of New York wrote of the industrious Americans to his home\\n', 'government: \"The consequence will be that if they can clothe themselves\\n', 'once, not only comfortably, but handsomely too, without the help of\\n', 'England, they who already are not very fond of submitting to government\\n', 'will soon think of putting in execution designs they have long harboured\\n', 'in their breasts. This will not seem strange when you consider what sort\\n', 'of people this country is inhabited by.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Iron Industry.=--Almost equally widespread was the art of iron\\n', 'working--one of the earliest and most picturesque of colonial\\n', 'industries. Lynn, Massachusetts, had a forge and skilled artisans within\\n', 'fifteen years after the founding of Boston. The smelting of iron began\\n', 'at New London and New Haven about 1658; in Litchfield county,\\n', 'Connecticut, a few years later; at Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in\\n', '1731; and near by at Lenox some thirty years after that. New Jersey had\\n', 'iron works at Shrewsbury within ten years after the founding of the\\n', 'colony in 1665. Iron forges appeared in the valleys of the Delaware and\\n', 'the Susquehanna early in the following century, and iron masters then\\n', 'laid the foundations of fortunes in a region destined to become one of\\n', 'the great iron centers of the world. Virginia began iron working in the\\n', 'year that saw the introduction of slavery. Although the industry soon\\n', 'lapsed, it was renewed and flourished in the eighteenth century.\\n', 'Governor Spotswood was called the \"Tubal Cain\" of the Old Dominion\\n', 'because he placed the industry on a firm foundation. Indeed it seems\\n', 'that every colony, except Georgia, had its iron foundry. Nails, wire,\\n', 'metallic ware, chains, anchors, bar and pig iron were made in large\\n', 'quantities; and Great Britain, by an act in 1750, encouraged the\\n', 'colonists to export rough iron to the British Islands.\\n', '\\n', '=Shipbuilding.=--Of all the specialized industries in the colonies,\\n', 'shipbuilding was the most important. The abundance of fir for masts, oak\\n', 'for timbers and boards, pitch for tar and turpentine, and hemp for rope\\n', 'made the way of the shipbuilder easy. Early in the seventeenth century a\\n', 'ship was built at New Amsterdam, and by the middle of that century\\n', 'shipyards were scattered along the New England coast at Newburyport,\\n', 'Salem, New Bedford, Newport, Providence, New London, and New Haven.\\n', 'Yards at Albany and Poughkeepsie in New York built ships for the trade\\n', 'of that colony with England and the Indies. Wilmington and Philadelphia\\n', 'soon entered the race and outdistanced New York, though unable to equal\\n', 'the pace set by New England. While Maryland, Virginia, and South\\n', 'Carolina also built ships, Southern interest was mainly confined to the\\n', 'lucrative business of producing ship materials: fir, cedar, hemp, and\\n', 'tar.\\n', '\\n', '=Fishing.=--The greatest single economic resource of New England outside\\n', 'of agriculture was the fisheries. This industry, started by hardy\\n', 'sailors from Europe, long before the landing of the Pilgrims, flourished\\n', 'under the indomitable seamanship of the Puritans, who labored with the\\n', 'net and the harpoon in almost every quarter of the Atlantic. \"Look,\"\\n', 'exclaimed Edmund Burke, in the House of Commons, \"at the manner in\\n', 'which the people of New England have of late carried on the whale\\n', 'fishery. Whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and\\n', \"behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of Hudson's Bay\\n\", \"and Davis's Straits, while we are looking for them beneath the arctic\\n\", 'circle, we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar\\n', 'cold, that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen\\n', 'serpent of the south.... Nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging\\n', 'to them than the accumulated winter of both poles. We know that, whilst\\n', 'some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of\\n', 'Africa, others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along\\n', 'the coast of Brazil. No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries. No\\n', 'climate that is not witness to their toils. Neither the perseverance of\\n', 'Holland nor the activity of France nor the dexterous and firm sagacity\\n', 'of English enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hard\\n', 'industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent\\n', 'people.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The influence of the business was widespread. A large and lucrative\\n', 'European trade was built upon it. The better quality of the fish caught\\n', 'for food was sold in the markets of Spain, Portugal, and Italy, or\\n', 'exchanged for salt, lemons, and raisins for the American market. The\\n', 'lower grades of fish were carried to the West Indies for slave\\n', 'consumption, and in part traded for sugar and molasses, which furnished\\n', 'the raw materials for the thriving rum industry of New England. These\\n', 'activities, in turn, stimulated shipbuilding, steadily enlarging the\\n', 'demand for fishing and merchant craft of every kind and thus keeping the\\n', 'shipwrights, calkers, rope makers, and other artisans of the seaport\\n', 'towns rushed with work. They also increased trade with the mother\\n', 'country for, out of the cash collected in the fish markets of Europe and\\n', 'the West Indies, the colonists paid for English manufactures. So an\\n', 'ever-widening circle of American enterprise centered around this single\\n', 'industry, the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit.\\n', '\\n', '=Oceanic Commerce and American Merchants.=--All through the eighteenth\\n', 'century, the commerce of the American colonies spread in every direction\\n', 'until it rivaled in the number of people employed, the capital engaged,\\n', 'and the profits gleaned, the commerce of European nations. A modern\\n', 'historian has said: \"The enterprising merchants of New England developed\\n', 'a network of trade routes that covered well-nigh half the world.\" This\\n', 'commerce, destined to be of such significance in the conflict with the\\n', 'mother country, presented, broadly speaking, two aspects.\\n', '\\n', 'On the one side, it involved the export of raw materials and\\n', 'agricultural produce. The Southern colonies produced for shipping,\\n', 'tobacco, rice, tar, pitch, and pine; the Middle colonies, grain, flour,\\n', 'furs, lumber, and salt pork; New England, fish, flour, rum, furs, shoes,\\n', 'and small articles of manufacture. The variety of products was in fact\\n', 'astounding. A sarcastic writer, while sneering at the idea of an\\n', 'American union, once remarked of colonial trade: \"What sort of dish will\\n', 'you make? New England will throw in fish and onions. The middle states,\\n', 'flax-seed and flour. Maryland and Virginia will add tobacco. North\\n', 'Carolina, pitch, tar, and turpentine. South Carolina, rice and indigo,\\n', 'and Georgia will sprinkle the whole composition with sawdust. Such an\\n', 'absurd jumble will you make if you attempt to form a union among such\\n', 'discordant materials as the thirteen British provinces.\"\\n', '\\n', 'On the other side, American commerce involved the import trade,\\n', 'consisting principally of English and continental manufactures, tea, and\\n', '\"India goods.\" Sugar and molasses, brought from the West Indies,\\n', 'supplied the flourishing distilleries of Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\\n', 'and Connecticut. The carriage of slaves from Africa to the Southern\\n', \"colonies engaged hundreds of New England's sailors and thousands of\\n\", 'pounds of her capital.\\n', '\\n', 'The disposition of imported goods in the colonies, though in part\\n', 'controlled by English factors located in America, employed also a large\\n', 'and important body of American merchants like the Willings and Morrises\\n', 'of Philadelphia; the Amorys, Hancocks, and Faneuils of Boston; and the\\n', 'Livingstons and Lows of New York. In their zeal and enterprise, they\\n', 'were worthy rivals of their English competitors, so celebrated for\\n', 'world-wide commercial operations. Though fully aware of the advantages\\n', 'they enjoyed in British markets and under the protection of the British\\n', 'navy, the American merchants were high-spirited and mettlesome, ready to\\n', 'contend with royal officers in order to shield American interests\\n', 'against outside interference.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: THE DUTCH WEST INDIA WAREHOUSE IN NEW AMSTERDAM\\n', '(NEW YORK CITY)]\\n', '\\n', 'Measured against the immense business of modern times, colonial commerce\\n', 'seems perhaps trivial. That, however, is not the test of its\\n', 'significance. It must be considered in relation to the growth of English\\n', 'colonial trade in its entirety--a relation which can be shown by a few\\n', 'startling figures. The whole export trade of England, including that to\\n', 'the colonies, was, in 1704, $6,509,000. On the eve of the American\\n', 'Revolution, namely, in 1772, English exports to the American colonies\\n', 'alone amounted to $6,024,000; in other words, almost as much as the\\n', 'whole foreign business of England two generations before. At the first\\n', 'date, colonial trade was but one-twelfth of the English export business;\\n', 'at the second date, it was considerably more than one-third. In 1704,\\n', 'Pennsylvania bought in English markets goods to the value of $11,459; in\\n', '1772 the purchases of the same colony amounted to $507,909. In short,\\n', 'Pennsylvania imports increased fifty times within sixty-eight years,\\n', 'amounting in 1772 to almost the entire export trade of England to the\\n', 'colonies at the opening of the century. The American colonies were\\n', 'indeed a great source of wealth to English merchants.\\n', '\\n', '=Intercolonial Commerce.=--Although the bad roads of colonial times made\\n', 'overland transportation difficult and costly, the many rivers and\\n', 'harbors along the coast favored a lively water-borne trade among the\\n', 'colonies. The Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna rivers in\\n', 'the North and the many smaller rivers in the South made it possible for\\n', 'goods to be brought from, and carried to, the interior regions in little\\n', 'sailing vessels with comparative ease. Sloops laden with manufactures,\\n', 'domestic and foreign, collected at some city like Providence, New York,\\n', 'or Philadelphia, skirted the coasts, visited small ports, and sailed up\\n', 'the navigable rivers to trade with local merchants who had for exchange\\n', 'the raw materials which they had gathered in from neighboring farms.\\n', 'Larger ships carried the grain, live stock, cloth, and hardware of New\\n', 'England to the Southern colonies, where they were traded for tobacco,\\n', 'leather, tar, and ship timber. From the harbors along the Connecticut\\n', 'shores there were frequent sailings down through Long Island Sound to\\n', 'Maryland, Virginia, and the distant Carolinas.\\n', '\\n', '=Growth of Towns.=--In connection with this thriving trade and industry\\n', 'there grew up along the coast a number of prosperous commercial centers\\n', 'which were soon reckoned among the first commercial towns of the whole\\n', 'British empire, comparing favorably in numbers and wealth with such\\n', 'ports as Liverpool and Bristol. The statistical records of that time are\\n', 'mainly guesses; but we know that Philadelphia stood first in size among\\n', 'these towns. Serving as the port of entry for Pennsylvania, Delaware,\\n', 'and western Jersey, it had drawn within its borders, just before the\\n', 'Revolution, about 25,000 inhabitants. Boston was second in rank, with\\n', 'somewhat more than 20,000 people. New York, the \"commercial capital of\\n', 'Connecticut and old East Jersey,\" was slightly smaller than Boston, but\\n', 'growing at a steady rate. The fourth town in size was Charleston, South\\n', 'Carolina, with about 10,000 inhabitants. Newport in Rhode Island, a\\n', 'center of rum manufacture and shipping, stood fifth, with a population\\n', 'of about 7000. Baltimore and Norfolk were counted as \"considerable\\n', 'towns.\" In the interior, Hartford in Connecticut, Lancaster and York in\\n', 'Pennsylvania, and Albany in New York, with growing populations and\\n', 'increasing trade, gave prophecy of an urban America away from the\\n', 'seaboard. The other towns were straggling villages. Williamsburg,\\n', 'Virginia, for example, had about two hundred houses, in which dwelt a\\n', 'dozen families of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen. Inland county\\n', 'seats often consisted of nothing more than a log courthouse, a prison,\\n', 'and one wretched inn to house judges, lawyers, and litigants during the\\n', 'sessions of the court.\\n', '\\n', 'The leading towns exercised an influence on colonial opinion all out of\\n', 'proportion to their population. They were the centers of wealth, for one\\n', 'thing; of the press and political activity, for another. Merchants and\\n', 'artisans could readily take concerted action on public questions arising\\n', 'from their commercial operations. The towns were also centers for news,\\n', 'gossip, religious controversy, and political discussion. In the market\\n', 'places the farmers from the countryside learned of British policies and\\n', 'laws, and so, mingling with the townsmen, were drawn into the main\\n', 'currents of opinion which set in toward colonial nationalism and\\n', 'independence.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', 'J.

There was\\n', 'little money in private purses or public treasuries to be dedicated to\\n', 'schools, libraries, and museums. Few there were with time to read long\\n', 'and widely, and fewer still who could devote their lives to things that\\n', 'delight the eye and the mind. And yet, poor and meager as the\\n', 'intellectual life of the colonists may seem by way of comparison, heroic\\n', 'efforts were made in every community to lift the people above the plane\\n', 'of mere existence. After the first clearings were opened in the forests\\n', 'those efforts were redoubled, and with lengthening years told upon the\\n', 'thought and spirit of the land. The appearance, during the struggle with\\n', 'England, of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with history,\\n', 'political philosophy, and the arts of war, government, and diplomacy\\n', 'itself bore eloquent testimony to the high quality of the American\\n', 'intellect. No one, not even the most critical, can run through the\\n', 'writings of distinguished Americans scattered from Massachusetts to\\n', 'Georgia--the Adamses, Ellsworth, the Morrises, the Livingstons,\\n', 'Hamilton, Franklin, Washington, Madison, Marshall, Henry, the Randolphs,\\n', 'and the Pinckneys--without coming to the conclusion that there was\\n', 'something in American colonial life which fostered minds of depth and\\n', 'power. Women surmounted even greater difficulties than the men in the\\n', 'process of self-education, and their keen interest in public issues is\\n', 'evident in many a record like the _Letters_ of Mrs. John Adams to her\\n', 'husband during the Revolution; the writings of Mrs. Mercy Otis Warren,\\n', 'the sister of James Otis, who measured her pen with the British\\n', 'propagandists; and the patriot newspapers founded and managed by women.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCHES\\n', '\\n', 'In the intellectual life of America, the churches assumed a role of high\\n', 'importance. There were abundant reasons for this. In many of the\\n', 'colonies--Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New England--the religious impulse\\n', 'had been one of the impelling motives in stimulating immigration. In all\\n', 'the colonies, the clergy, at least in the beginning, formed the only\\n', 'class with any leisure to devote to matters of the spirit. They preached\\n', 'on Sundays and taught school on week days. They led in the discussion of\\n', 'local problems and in the formation of political opinion, so much of\\n', 'which was concerned with the relation between church and state. They\\n', 'wrote books and pamphlets. They filled most of the chairs in the\\n', 'colleges; under clerical guidance, intellectual and spiritual, the\\n', 'Americans received their formal education. In several of the provinces\\n', 'the Anglican Church was established by law. In New England the Puritans\\n', 'were supreme, notwithstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear their\\n', 'authority. In the Middle colonies, particularly, the multiplication of\\n', 'sects made the dominance of any single denomination impossible; and in\\n', 'all of them there was a growing diversity of faith, which promised in\\n', 'time a separation of church and state and freedom of opinion.\\n', '\\n', '=The Church of England.=--Virginia was the stronghold of the English\\n', 'system of church and state. The Anglican faith and worship were\\n', 'prescribed by law, sustained by taxes imposed on all, and favored by the\\n', 'governor, the provincial councilors, and the richest planters. \"The\\n', 'Established Church,\" says Lodge, \"was one of the appendages of the\\n', 'Virginia aristocracy. They controlled the vestries and the ministers,\\n', 'and the parish church stood not infrequently on the estate of the\\n', 'planter who built and managed it.\" As in England, Catholics and\\n', 'Protestant Dissenters were at first laid under heavy disabilities. Only\\n', 'slowly and on sufferance were they admitted to the province; but when\\n', 'once they were even covertly tolerated, they pressed steadily in, until,\\n', 'by the Revolution, they outnumbered the adherents of the established\\n', 'order.\\n', '\\n', 'The Church was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxes in the\\n', 'Carolinas after 1704, and in Georgia after that colony passed directly\\n', 'under the crown in 1754--this in spite of the fact that the majority of\\n', 'the inhabitants were Dissenters. Against the protests of the Catholics\\n', 'it was likewise established in Maryland. In New York, too,\\n', 'notwithstanding the resistance of the Dutch, the Established Church was\\n', 'fostered by the provincial officials, and the Anglicans, embracing about\\n', 'one-fifteenth of the population, exerted an influence all out of\\n', 'proportion to their numbers.\\n', '\\n', 'Many factors helped to enhance the power of the English Church in the\\n', 'colonies. It was supported by the British government and the official\\n', 'class sent out to the provinces. Its bishops and archbishops in England\\n', 'were appointed by the king, and its faith and service were set forth by\\n', 'acts of Parliament. Having its seat of power in the English monarchy, it\\n', 'could hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown and so\\n', 'counteract to some extent the independent spirit that was growing up in\\n', 'America. The Church, always a strong bulwark of the state, therefore had\\n', 'a political role to play here as in England. Able bishops and far-seeing\\n', 'leaders firmly grasped this fact about the middle of the eighteenth\\n', 'century and redoubled their efforts to augment the influence of the\\n', 'Church in provincial affairs. Unhappily for their plans they failed to\\n', 'calculate in advance the effect of their methods upon dissenting\\n', 'Protestants, who still cherished memories of bitter religious conflicts\\n', 'in the mother country.\\n', '\\n', '=Puritanism in New England.=--If the established faith made for imperial\\n', 'unity, the same could not be said of Puritanism. The Plymouth Pilgrims\\n', 'had cast off all allegiance to the Anglican Church and established a\\n', 'separate and independent congregation before they came to America. The\\n', 'Puritans, essaying at first the task of reformers within the Church,\\n', 'soon after their arrival in Massachusetts, likewise flung off their yoke\\n', 'of union with the Anglicans. In each town a separate congregation was\\n', 'organized, the male members choosing the pastor, the teachers, and the\\n', 'other officers. They also composed the voters in the town meeting, where\\n', 'secular matters were determined. The union of church and government was\\n', 'thus complete, and uniformity of faith and life prescribed by law and\\n', 'enforced by civil authorities; but this worked for local autonomy\\n', 'instead of imperial unity.\\n', '\\n', 'The clergy became a powerful class, dominant through their learning and\\n', 'their fearful denunciations of the faithless. They wrote the books for\\n', 'the people to read--the famous Cotton Mather having three hundred and\\n', 'eighty-three books and pamphlets to his credit. In cooperation with the\\n', 'civil officers they enforced a strict observance of the Puritan\\n', \"Sabbath--a day of rest that began at six o'clock on Saturday evening and\\n\", 'lasted until sunset on Sunday. All work, all trading, all amusement, and\\n', 'all worldly conversation were absolutely prohibited during those hours.\\n', 'A thoughtless maid servant who for some earthly reason smiled in church\\n', 'was in danger of being banished as a vagabond. Robert Pike, a devout\\n', 'Puritan, thinking the sun had gone to rest, ventured forth on horseback\\n', 'one Sunday evening and was luckless enough to have a ray of light strike\\n', 'him through a rift in the clouds. The next day he was brought into court\\n', 'and fined for \"his ungodly conduct.\" With persons accused of witchcraft\\n', 'the Puritans were still more ruthless. When a mania of persecution swept\\n', 'over Massachusetts in 1692, eighteen people were hanged, one was pressed\\n', 'to death, many suffered imprisonment, and two died in jail.\\n', '\\n', 'Just about this time, however, there came a break in the uniformity of\\n', 'Puritan rule. The crown and church in England had long looked upon it\\n', 'with disfavor, and in 1684 King Charles II annulled the old charter of\\n', 'the Massachusetts Bay Company. A new document issued seven years later\\n', 'wrested from the Puritans of the colony the right to elect their own\\n', 'governor and reserved the power of appointment to the king. It also\\n', 'abolished the rule limiting the suffrage to church members, substituting\\n', 'for it a simple property qualification. Thus a royal governor and an\\n', 'official family, certain to be Episcopalian in faith and monarchist in\\n', 'sympathies, were forced upon Massachusetts; and members of all religious\\n', 'denominations, if they had the required amount of property, were\\n', 'permitted to take part in elections. By this act in the name of the\\n', 'crown, the Puritan monopoly was broken down in Massachusetts, and that\\n', 'province was brought into line with Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New\\n', 'Hampshire, where property, not religious faith, was the test for the\\n', 'suffrage.\\n', '\\n', '=Growth of Religious Toleration.=--Though neither the Anglicans of\\n', 'Virginia nor the Puritans of Massachusetts believed in toleration for\\n', 'other denominations, that principle was strictly applied in Rhode\\n', 'Island. There, under the leadership of Roger Williams, liberty in\\n', 'matters of conscience was established in the beginning. Maryland, by\\n', 'granting in 1649 freedom to those who professed to believe in Jesus\\n', 'Christ, opened its gates to all Christians; and Pennsylvania, true to\\n', 'the tenets of the Friends, gave freedom of conscience to those \"who\\n', 'confess and acknowledge the one Almighty and Eternal God to be the\\n', 'creator, upholder, and ruler of the World.\" By one circumstance or\\n', 'another, the Middle colonies were thus early characterized by diversity\\n', 'rather than uniformity of opinion. Dutch Protestants, Huguenots,\\n', 'Quakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, New Lights, Moravians, Lutherans,\\n', 'Catholics, and other denominations became too strongly intrenched and\\n', 'too widely scattered to permit any one of them to rule, if it had\\n', 'desired to do so. There were communities and indeed whole sections where\\n', 'one or another church prevailed, but in no colony was a legislature\\n', 'steadily controlled by a single group. Toleration encouraged diversity,\\n', 'and diversity, in turn, worked for greater toleration.\\n', '\\n', 'The government and faith of the dissenting denominations conspired with\\n', 'economic and political tendencies to draw America away from the English\\n', 'state. Presbyterians, Quakers, Baptists, and Puritans had no hierarchy\\n', 'of bishops and archbishops to bind them to the seat of power in London.\\n', 'Neither did they look to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting\\n', 'articles of faith. Local self-government in matters ecclesiastical\\n', 'helped to train them for local self-government in matters political. The\\n', 'spirit of independence which led Dissenters to revolt in the Old World,\\n', 'nourished as it was amid favorable circumstances in the New World, made\\n', 'them all the more zealous in the defense of every right against\\n', 'authority imposed from without.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES\\n', '\\n', '=Religion and Local Schools.=--One of the first cares of each Protestant\\n', 'denomination was the education of the children in the faith. In this\\n', 'work the Bible became the center of interest. The English version was\\n', 'indeed the one book of the people.

Massachusetts was\\n', 'scarcely twenty years old before education of this character was\\n', 'declared to be compulsory, and provision was made for public schools\\n', 'where those not taught at home could receive instruction in reading and\\n', 'writing.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: A PAGE FROM A FAMOUS SCHOOLBOOK\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"     A In ADAM'S Fall\\n\", '       We sinned all.\\n', '\\n', '     B Heaven to find,\\n', '       The Bible Mind.\\n', '\\n', \"     C Christ crucify'd\\n\", \"       For sinners dy'd.\\n\", '\\n', \"     D The Deluge drown'd\\n\", '       The Earth around.\\n', '\\n', '     E ELIJAH hid\\n', '       by Ravens fed.\\n', '\\n', '     F The judgment made\\n', '       FELIX afraid.]\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Outside of New England the idea of compulsory education was not regarded\\n', 'with the same favor; but the whole land was nevertheless dotted with\\n', 'little schools kept by \"dames, itinerant teachers, or local parsons.\"\\n', 'Whether we turn to the life of Franklin in the North or Washington in\\n', 'the South, we read of tiny schoolhouses, where boys, and sometimes\\n', 'girls, were taught to read and write.

Though illiteracy was widespread, there is evidence to show\\n', 'that the diffusion of knowledge among the masses was making steady\\n', 'progress all through the eighteenth century.\\n', '\\n', '=Religion and Higher Learning.=--Religious motives entered into the\\n', 'establishment of colleges as well as local schools. Harvard, founded in\\n', '1636, and Yale, opened in 1718, were intended primarily to train\\n', '\"learned and godly ministers\" for the Puritan churches of New England.\\n', 'To the far North, Dartmouth, chartered in 1769, was designed first as a\\n', 'mission to the Indians and then as a college for the sons of New England\\n', 'farmers preparing to preach, teach, or practice law. The College of New\\n', 'Jersey, organized in 1746 and removed to Princeton eleven years later,\\n', 'was sustained by the Presbyterians. Two colleges looked to the\\n', 'Established Church as their source of inspiration and support: William\\n', \"and Mary, founded in Virginia in 1693, and King's College, now Columbia\\n\", 'University, chartered by King George II in 1754, on an appeal from the\\n', 'New York Anglicans, alarmed at the growth of religious dissent and the\\n', '\"republican tendencies\" of the age. Two colleges revealed a drift away\\n', 'from sectarianism. Brown, established in Rhode Island in 1764, and the\\n', 'Philadelphia Academy, forerunner of the University of Pennsylvania,\\n', 'organized by Benjamin Franklin, reflected the spirit of toleration by\\n', 'giving representation on the board of trustees to several religious\\n', \"sects. It was Franklin's idea that his college should prepare young men\\n\", 'to serve in public office as leaders of the people and ornaments to\\n', 'their country.\\n', '\\n', '=Self-education in America.=--Important as were these institutions of\\n', 'learning, higher education was by no means confined within their walls.\\n', 'Many well-to-do families sent their sons to Oxford or Cambridge in\\n', 'England. Private tutoring in the home was common. In still more families\\n', 'there were intelligent children who grew up in the great colonial school\\n', 'of adversity and who trained themselves until, in every contest of mind\\n', 'and wit, they could vie with the sons of Harvard or William and Mary or\\n', 'any other college. Such, for example, was Benjamin Franklin, whose\\n', 'charming autobiography, in addition to being an American classic, is a\\n', 'fine record of self-education. His formal training in the classroom was\\n', 'limited to a few years at a local school in Boston; but his\\n', 'self-education continued throughout his life. He early manifested a zeal\\n', \"for reading, and devoured, he tells us, his father's dry library on\\n\", \"theology, Bunyan's works, Defoe's writings, Plutarch's _Lives_, Locke's\\n\", '_On the Human Understanding_, and innumerable volumes dealing with\\n', 'secular subjects. His literary style, perhaps the best of his time,\\n', 'Franklin acquired by the diligent and repeated analysis of the\\n', '_Spectator_. In a life crowded with labors, he found time to read widely\\n', 'in natural science and to win single-handed recognition at the hands of\\n', 'European savants for his discoveries in electricity. By his own efforts\\n', 'he \"attained an acquaintance\" with Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish,\\n', 'thus unconsciously preparing himself for the day when he was to speak\\n', 'for all America at the court of the king of France.\\n', '\\n', 'Lesser lights than Franklin, educated by the same process, were found\\n', 'all over colonial America. From this fruitful source of native ability,\\n', 'self-educated, the American cause drew great strength in the trials of\\n', 'the Revolution.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE COLONIAL PRESS\\n', '\\n', '=The Rise of the Newspaper.=--The evolution of American democracy into a\\n', 'government by public opinion, enlightened by the open discussion of\\n', 'political questions, was in no small measure aided by a free press. That\\n', 'too, like education, was a matter of slow growth. A printing press was\\n', 'brought to Massachusetts in 1639, but it was put in charge of an\\n', 'official censor and limited to the publication of religious works. Forty\\n', 'years elapsed before the first newspaper appeared, bearing the curious\\n', 'title, _Public Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestic_, and it had not\\n', 'been running very long before the government of Massachusetts suppressed\\n', 'it for discussing a political question.\\n', '\\n', 'Publishing, indeed, seemed to be a precarious business; but in 1704\\n', 'there came a second venture in journalism, _The Boston News-Letter_,\\n', 'which proved to be a more lasting enterprise because it refrained from\\n', 'criticizing the authorities. Still the public interest languished. When\\n', \"Franklin's brother, James, began to issue his _New England Courant_\\n\", 'about 1720, his friends sought to dissuade him, saying that one\\n', 'newspaper was enough for America. Nevertheless he continued it; and his\\n', 'confidence in the future was rewarded. In nearly every colony a gazette\\n', 'or chronicle appeared within the next thirty years or more. Benjamin\\n', 'Franklin was able to record in 1771 that America had twenty-five\\n', 'newspapers. Boston led with five. Philadelphia had three: two in English\\n', 'and one in German.\\n', '\\n', '=Censorship and Restraints on the Press.=--The idea of printing,\\n', 'unlicensed by the government and uncontrolled by the church, was,\\n', 'however, slow in taking form. The founders of the American colonies had\\n', 'never known what it was to have the free and open publication of books,\\n', 'pamphlets, broadsides, and newspapers. When the art of printing was\\n', 'first discovered, the control of publishing was vested in clerical\\n', 'authorities. After the establishment of the State Church in England in\\n', 'the reign of Elizabeth, censorship of the press became a part of royal\\n', 'prerogative. Printing was restricted to Oxford, Cambridge, and London;\\n', 'and no one could publish anything without previous approval of the\\n', 'official censor. When the Puritans were in power, the popular party,\\n', 'with a zeal which rivaled that of the crown, sought, in turn, to silence\\n', 'royalist and clerical writers by a vigorous censorship. After the\\n', 'restoration of the monarchy, control of the press was once more placed\\n', 'in royal hands, where it remained until 1695, when Parliament, by\\n', 'failing to renew the licensing act, did away entirely with the official\\n', '\\n', 'censorship. By that time political parties were so powerful and so\\n', 'active and printing presses were so numerous that official review of all\\n', 'published matter became a sheer impossibility.\\n', '\\n', 'In America, likewise, some troublesome questions arose in connection\\n', 'with freedom of the press. The Puritans of Massachusetts were no less\\n', 'anxious than King Charles or the Archbishop of London to shut out from\\n', 'the prying eyes of the people all literature \"not mete for them to\\n', 'read\"; and so they established a system of official licensing for\\n', 'presses, which lasted until 1755. In the other colonies where there was\\n', 'more diversity of opinion and publishers could set up in business with\\n', 'impunity, they were nevertheless constantly liable to arrest for\\n', 'printing anything displeasing to the colonial governments. In 1721 the\\n', 'editor of the _Mercury_ in Philadelphia was called before the\\n', 'proprietary council and ordered to apologize for a political article,\\n', 'and for a later offense of a similar character he was thrown into jail.\\n', 'A still more famous case was that of Peter Zenger, a New York publisher,\\n', 'who was arrested in 1735 for criticising the administration. Lawyers who\\n', 'ventured to defend the unlucky editor were deprived of their licenses to\\n', 'practice, and it became necessary to bring an attorney all the way from\\n', 'Philadelphia. By this time the tension of feeling was high, and the\\n', 'approbation of the public was forthcoming when the lawyer for the\\n', 'defense exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of liberty itself, not\\n', 'that of the poor printer, was on trial! The verdict for Zenger, when it\\n', 'finally came, was the signal for an outburst of popular rejoicing.\\n', \"Already the people of King George's province knew how precious a thing\\n\", 'is the freedom of the press.\\n', '\\n', 'Thanks to the schools, few and scattered as they were, and to the\\n', 'vigilance of parents, a very large portion, perhaps nearly one-half, of\\n', 'the colonists could read. Through the newspapers, pamphlets, and\\n', 'almanacs that streamed from the types, the people could follow the\\n', 'course of public events and grasp the significance of political\\n', 'arguments. An American opinion was in the process of making--an\\n', 'independent opinion nourished by the press and enriched by discussions\\n', 'around the fireside and at the taverns. When the day of resistance to\\n', 'British rule came, government by opinion was at hand. For every person\\n', 'who could hear the voice of Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, there were a\\n', 'thousand who could see their appeals on the printed page. Men who had\\n', \"spelled out their letters while poring over Franklin's _Poor Richard's\\n\", \"Almanac_ lived to read Thomas Paine's thrilling call to arms.\\n\", '\\n', '\\n', 'THE EVOLUTION IN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS\\n', '\\n', 'Two very distinct lines of development appeared in colonial politics.\\n', 'The one, exalting royal rights and aristocratic privileges, was the\\n', 'drift toward provincial government through royal officers appointed in\\n', 'England. The other, leading toward democracy and self-government, was\\n', 'the growth in the power of the popular legislative assembly. Each\\n', 'movement gave impetus to the other, with increasing force during the\\n', 'passing years, until at last the final collision between the two ideals\\n', 'of government came in the war of independence.\\n', '\\n', '=The Royal Provinces.=--Of the thirteen English colonies eight were\\n', 'royal provinces in 1776, with governors appointed by the king. Virginia\\n', 'passed under the direct rule of the crown in 1624, when the charter of\\n', 'the London Company was annulled. The Massachusetts Bay corporation lost\\n', 'its charter in 1684, and the new instrument granted seven years later\\n', 'stripped the colonists of the right to choose their chief executive. In\\n', 'the early decades of the eighteenth century both the Carolinas were\\n', 'given the provincial instead of the proprietary form. New Hampshire,\\n', 'severed from Massachusetts in 1679, and Georgia, surrendered by the\\n', 'trustees in 1752, went into the hands of the crown. New York,\\n', 'transferred to the Duke of York on its capture from the Dutch in 1664,\\n', 'became a province when he took the title of James II in 1685. New\\n', 'Jersey, after remaining for nearly forty years under proprietors, was\\n', 'brought directly under the king in 1702. Maryland, Pennsylvania, and\\n', 'Delaware, although they retained their proprietary character until the\\n', 'Revolution, were in some respects like the royal colonies, for their\\n', 'governors were as independent of popular choice as were the appointees\\n', 'of King George. Only two colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut,\\n', 'retained full self-government on the eve of the Revolution. They alone\\n', 'had governors and legislatures entirely of their own choosing.\\n', '\\n', 'The chief officer of the royal province was the governor, who enjoyed\\n', 'high and important powers which he naturally sought to augment at every\\n', 'turn. He enforced the laws and, usually with the consent of a council,\\n', 'appointed the civil and military officers. He granted pardons and\\n', 'reprieves; he was head of the highest court; he was commander-in-chief\\n', 'of the militia; he levied troops for defense and enforced martial law in\\n', 'time of invasion, war, and rebellion. In all the provinces, except\\n', 'Massachusetts, he named the councilors who composed the upper house of\\n', 'the legislature and was likely to choose those who favored his claims.\\n', 'He summoned, adjourned, and dissolved the popular assembly, or the lower\\n', 'house; he laid before it the projects of law desired by the crown; and\\n', 'he vetoed measures which he thought objectionable. Here were in America\\n', 'all the elements of royal prerogative against which Hampden had\\n', 'protested and Cromwell had battled in England.\\n', '\\n', \"[Illustration: THE ROYAL GOVERNOR'S PALACE AT NEW BERNE]\\n\", '\\n', 'The colonial governors were generally surrounded by a body of\\n', 'office-seekers and hunters for land grants. Some of them were noblemen\\n', 'of broken estates who had come to America to improve their fortunes. The\\n', 'pretensions of this circle grated on colonial nerves, and privileges\\n', 'granted to them, often at the expense of colonists, did much to deepen\\n', 'popular antipathy to the British government. Favors extended to\\n', 'adherents of the Established Church displeased Dissenters. The\\n', 'reappearance of this formidable union of church and state, from which\\n', 'they had fled, stirred anew the ancient wrath against that combination.\\n', '\\n', '=The Colonial Assembly.=--Coincident with the drift toward\\n', 'administration through royal governors was the second and opposite\\n', 'tendency, namely, a steady growth in the practice of self-government.\\n', 'The voters of England had long been accustomed to share in taxation and\\n', 'law-making through representatives in Parliament, and the idea was early\\n', 'introduced in America. Virginia was only twelve years old (1619) when\\n', 'its first representative assembly appeared. As the towns of\\n', 'Massachusetts multiplied and it became impossible for all the members of\\n', 'the corporation to meet at one place, the representative idea was\\n', 'adopted, in 1633. The river towns of Connecticut formed a representative\\n', 'system under their \"Fundamental Orders\" of 1639, and the entire colony\\n', 'was given a royal charter in 1662. Generosity, as well as practical\\n', 'considerations, induced such proprietors as Lord Baltimore and William\\n', 'Penn to invite their colonists to share in the government as soon as any\\n', 'considerable settlements were made. Thus by one process or another every\\n', 'one of the colonies secured a popular assembly.\\n', '\\n', 'It is true that in the provision for popular elections, the suffrage was\\n', 'finally restricted to property owners or taxpayers, with a leaning\\n', 'toward the freehold qualification. In Virginia, the rural voter had to\\n', 'be a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land, if there was no\\n', 'house on it, or twenty-five acres with a house twenty-five feet square.\\n', 'In Massachusetts, the voter for member of the assembly under the charter\\n', 'of 1691 had to be a freeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year\\n', 'at least or of other property to the value of forty pounds sterling. In\\n', 'Pennsylvania, the suffrage was granted to freeholders owning fifty acres\\n', 'or more of land well seated, twelve acres cleared, and to other persons\\n', 'worth at least fifty pounds in lawful money.\\n', '\\n', 'Restrictions like these undoubtedly excluded from the suffrage a very\\n', 'considerable number of men, particularly the mechanics and artisans of\\n', 'the towns, who were by no means content with their position.\\n', 'Nevertheless, it was relatively easy for any man to acquire a small\\n', 'freehold, so cheap and abundant was land; and in fact a large proportion\\n', 'of the colonists were land owners. Thus the assemblies, in spite of the\\n', 'limited suffrage, acquired a democratic tone.\\n', '\\n', 'The popular character of the assemblies increased as they became engaged\\n', 'in battles with the royal and proprietary governors. When called upon by\\n', 'the executive to make provision for the support of the administration,\\n', 'the legislature took advantage of the opportunity to make terms in the\\n', 'interest of the taxpayers. It made annual, not permanent, grants of\\n', 'money to pay official salaries and then insisted upon electing a\\n', 'treasurer to dole it out. Thus the colonists learned some of the\\n', 'mysteries of public finance, as well as the management of rapacious\\n', 'officials. The legislature also used its power over money grants to\\n', 'force the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise have vetoed.\\n', '\\n', '=Contests between Legislatures and Governors.=--As may be imagined, many\\n', 'and bitter were the contests between the royal and proprietary governors\\n', 'and the colonial assemblies. Franklin relates an amusing story of how\\n', 'the Pennsylvania assembly held in one hand a bill for the executive to\\n', 'sign and, in the other hand, the money to pay his salary. Then, with sly\\n', 'humor, Franklin adds: \"Do not, my courteous reader, take pet at our\\n', 'proprietary constitution for these our bargain and sale proceedings in\\n', 'legislation. It is a happy country where justice and what was your own\\n', 'before can be had for ready money. It is another addition to the value\\n', 'of money and of course another spur to industry. Every land is not so\\n', 'blessed.\"\\n', '\\n', 'It must not be thought, however, that every governor got off as easily\\n', \"as Franklin's tale implies. On the contrary, the legislatures, like\\n\", 'Caesar, fed upon meat that made them great and steadily encroached upon\\n', 'executive prerogatives as they tried out and found their strength. If\\n', 'we may believe contemporary laments, the power of the crown in America\\n', 'was diminishing when it was struck down altogether. In New York, the\\n', 'friends of the governor complained in 1747 that \"the inhabitants of\\n', 'plantations are generally educated in republican principles; upon\\n', 'republican principles all is conducted. Little more than a shadow of\\n', 'royal authority remains in the Northern colonies.\" \"Here,\" echoed the\\n', 'governor of South Carolina, the following year, \"levelling principles\\n', 'prevail; the frame of the civil government is unhinged; a governor, if\\n', 'he would be idolized, must betray his trust; the people have got their\\n', 'whole administration in their hands; the election of the members of the\\n', 'assembly is by ballot; not civil posts only, but all ecclesiastical\\n', 'preferments, are in the disposal or election of the people.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Though baffled by the \"levelling principles\" of the colonial assemblies,\\n', 'the governors did not give up the case as hopeless. Instead they evolved\\n', 'a system of policy and action which they thought could bring the\\n', 'obstinate provincials to terms. That system, traceable in their letters\\n', 'to the government in London, consisted of three parts: (1) the royal\\n', 'officers in the colonies were to be made independent of the legislatures\\n', 'by taxes imposed by acts of Parliament; (2) a British standing army was\\n', 'to be maintained in America; (3) the remaining colonial charters were to\\n', 'be revoked and government by direct royal authority was to be enlarged.\\n', '\\n', 'Such a system seemed plausible enough to King George III and to many\\n', 'ministers of the crown in London. With governors, courts, and an army\\n', 'independent of the colonists, they imagined it would be easy to carry\\n', 'out both royal orders and acts of Parliament. This reasoning seemed both\\n', 'practical and logical. Nor was it founded on theory, for it came fresh\\n', 'from the governors themselves. It was wanting in one respect only. It\\n', 'failed to take account of the fact that the American people were growing\\n', 'strong in the practice of self-government and could dispense with the\\n', 'tutelage of the British ministry, no matter how excellent it might be or\\n', 'how benevolent its intentions.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', 'A.M.

The imperative call to common\\n', 'defense, the habit of sharing common burdens, the fusing force of common\\n', 'service--these things, induced by the necessity of resisting outside\\n', 'interference, act as an amalgam drawing together all elements, except,\\n', 'perhaps, the most discordant.

A\\n', 'generation later, King Philip, son of Massasoit, the friend of the\\n', 'Pilgrims, called his tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought\\n', 'the strength of all New England to the field and ended in his own\\n', 'destruction. In New York, the relations with the Indians, especially\\n', 'with the Algonquins and the Mohawks, were marked by periodic and\\n', 'desperate wars. Virginia and her Southern neighbors suffered as did New\\n', 'England. In 1622 Opecacano, a brother of Powhatan, the friend of the\\n', 'Jamestown settlers, launched a general massacre; and in 1644 he\\n', 'attempted a war of extermination.

It was the ambition of Louis XIV of France,\\n', 'rather than the labors of Jesuit missionaries and French rangers, that\\n', 'sounded the first note of colonial alarm.\\n', '\\n', 'Evidence of this lies in the fact that three conflicts between the\\n', 'English and the French occurred before their advancing frontiers met on\\n', \"the Pennsylvania border. King William's War (1689-1697), Queen Anne's\\n\", \"War (1701-1713), and King George's War (1744-1748) owed their origins\\n\", 'and their endings mainly to the intrigues and rivalries of European\\n', 'powers, although they all involved the American colonies in struggles\\n', 'with the French and their savage allies.\\n', '\\n', '=The Clash in the Ohio Valley.=--The second of these wars had hardly\\n', 'closed, however, before the English colonists themselves began to be\\n', 'seriously alarmed about the rapidly expanding French dominion in the\\n', 'West. Marquette and Joliet, who opened the Lake region, and La Salle,\\n', 'who in 1682 had gone down the Mississippi to the Gulf, had been followed\\n', 'by the builders of forts. In 1718, the French founded New Orleans, thus\\n', 'taking possession of the gateway to the Mississippi as well as the St.\\n', 'Lawrence. A few years later they built Fort Niagara; in 1731 they\\n', 'occupied Crown Point; in 1749 they formally announced their dominion\\n', 'over all the territory drained by the Ohio River. Having asserted this\\n', 'lofty claim, they set out to make it good by constructing in the years\\n', '1752-1754 Fort Le Boeuf near Lake Erie, Fort Venango on the upper\\n', 'waters of the Allegheny, and Fort Duquesne at the junction of the\\n', 'streams forming the Ohio. Though they were warned by George Washington,\\n', 'in the name of the governor of Virginia, to keep out of territory \"so\\n', 'notoriously known to be property of the crown of Great Britain,\" the\\n', 'French showed no signs of relinquishing their pretensions.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', \"BRADDOCK'S RETREAT]\\n\", '\\n', '=The Final Phase--the French and Indian War.=--Thus it happened that the\\n', \"shot which opened the Seven Years' War, known in America as the French\\n\", 'and Indian War, was fired in the wilds of Pennsylvania. There began the\\n', 'conflict that spread to Europe and even Asia and finally involved\\n', 'England and Prussia, on the one side, and France, Austria, Spain, and\\n', 'minor powers on the other. On American soil, the defeat of Braddock in\\n', \"1755 and Wolfe's exploit in capturing Quebec four years later were the\\n\", 'dramatic features. On the continent of Europe, England subsidized\\n', 'Prussian arms to hold France at bay. In India, on the banks of the\\n', 'Ganges, as on the banks of the St. Lawrence, British arms were\\n', 'triumphant. Well could the historian write: \"Conquests equaling in\\n', 'rapidity and far surpassing in magnitude those of Cortes and Pizarro had\\n', 'been achieved in the East.\" Well could the merchants of London declare\\n', 'that under the administration of William Pitt, the imperial genius of\\n', 'this world-wide conflict, commerce had been \"united with and made to\\n', 'flourish by war.\"\\n', '\\n', 'From the point of view of the British empire, the results of the war\\n', 'were momentous. By the peace of 1763, Canada and the territory east of\\n', 'the Mississippi, except New Orleans, passed under the British flag. The\\n', 'remainder of the Louisiana territory was transferred to Spain and French\\n', 'imperial ambitions on the American continent were laid to rest. In\\n', 'exchange for Havana, which the British had seized during the war, Spain\\n', 'ceded to King George the colony of Florida. Not without warrant did\\n', 'Macaulay write in after years that Pitt \"was the first Englishman of his\\n', 'time; and he had made England the first country in the world.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE EFFECTS OF WARFARE ON THE COLONIES\\n', '\\n', 'The various wars with the French and the Indians, trivial in detail as\\n', 'they seem to-day, had a profound influence on colonial life and on the\\n', 'destiny of America. Circumstances beyond the control of popular\\n', 'assemblies, jealous of their individual powers, compelled cooperation\\n', 'among them, grudging and stingy no doubt, but still cooperation. The\\n', 'American people, more eager to be busy in their fields or at their\\n', 'trades, were simply forced to raise and support armies, to learn the\\n', 'arts of warfare, and to practice, if in a small theater, the science of\\n', 'statecraft. These forces, all cumulative, drove the colonists, so\\n', 'tenaciously provincial in their habits, in the direction of nationalism.\\n', '\\n', '=The New England Confederation.=--It was in their efforts to deal with\\n', 'the problems presented by the Indian and French menace that the\\n', 'Americans took the first steps toward union. Though there were many\\n', 'common ties among the settlers of New England, it required a deadly\\n', 'fear of the Indians to produce in 1643 the New England Confederation,\\n', 'composed of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven. The\\n', 'colonies so united were bound together in \"a firm and perpetual league\\n', 'of friendship and amity for offense and defense, mutual service and\\n', 'succor, upon all just occasions.\" They made provision for distributing\\n', 'the burdens of wars among the members and provided for a congress of\\n', 'commissioners from each colony to determine upon common policies. For\\n', 'some twenty years the Confederation was active and it continued to hold\\n', 'meetings until after the extinction of the Indian peril on the immediate\\n', 'border.\\n', '\\n', 'Virginia, no less than Massachusetts, was aware of the importance of\\n', 'intercolonial cooperation. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the\\n', 'Old Dominion began treaties of commerce and amity with New York and the\\n', 'colonies of New England. In 1684 delegates from Virginia met at Albany\\n', 'with the agents of New York and Massachusetts to discuss problems of\\n', 'mutual defense. A few years later the Old Dominion cooperated loyally\\n', 'with the Carolinas in defending their borders against Indian forays.\\n', '\\n', '=The Albany Plan of Union.=--An attempt at a general colonial union was\\n', 'made in 1754. On the suggestion of the Lords of Trade in England, a\\n', 'conference was held at Albany to consider Indian relations, to devise\\n', 'measures of defense against the French, and to enter into \"articles of\\n', \"union and confederation for the general defense of his Majesty's\\n\", 'subjects and interests in North America as well in time of peace as of\\n', 'war.\" New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York,\\n', 'Pennsylvania, and Maryland were represented. After a long discussion, a\\n', 'plan of union, drafted mainly, it seems, by Benjamin Franklin, was\\n', 'adopted and sent to the colonies and the crown for approval. The\\n', 'colonies, jealous of their individual rights, refused to accept the\\n', 'scheme and the king disapproved it for the reason, Franklin said, that\\n', 'it had \"too much weight in the democratic part of the constitution.\"\\n', 'Though the Albany union failed, the document is still worthy of study\\n', 'because it forecast many of the perplexing problems that were not solved\\n', 'until thirty-three years afterward, when another convention of which\\n', 'also Franklin was a member drafted the Constitution of the United\\n', 'States.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN]\\n', '\\n', '=The Military Education of the Colonists.=--The same wars that showed\\n', 'the provincials the meaning of union likewise instructed them in the art\\n', 'of defending their institutions. Particularly was this true of the last\\n', 'French and Indian conflict, which stretched all the way from Maine to\\n', 'the Carolinas and made heavy calls upon them all for troops. The answer,\\n', 'it is admitted, was far from satisfactory to the British government and\\n', 'the conduct of the militiamen was far from professional; but thousands\\n', 'of Americans got a taste, a strong taste, of actual fighting in the\\n', 'field. Men like George Washington and Daniel Morgan learned lessons that\\n', 'were not forgotten in after years. They saw what American militiamen\\n', 'could do under favorable circumstances and they watched British regulars\\n', 'operating on American soil. \"This whole transaction,\" shrewdly remarked\\n', 'Franklin of Braddock\\'s campaign, \"gave us Americans the first suspicion\\n', 'that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regular troops had not\\n', 'been well founded.\" It was no mere accident that the Virginia colonel\\n', 'who drew his sword under the elm at Cambridge and took command of the\\n', 'army of the Revolution was the brave officer who had \"spurned the\\n', 'whistle of bullets\" at the memorable battle in western Pennsylvania.\\n', '\\n', '=Financial Burdens and Commercial Disorder.=--While the provincials were\\n', 'learning lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills. All the\\n', \"conflicts were costly in treasure as in blood. King Philip's war left\\n\", 'New England weak and almost bankrupt. The French and Indian struggle was\\n', 'especially expensive. The twenty-five thousand men put in the field by\\n', 'the colonies were sustained only by huge outlays of money. Paper\\n', 'currency streamed from the press and debts were accumulated. Commerce\\n', 'was driven from its usual channels and prices were enhanced. When the\\n', 'end came, both England and America were staggering under heavy\\n', 'liabilities, and to make matters worse there was a fall of prices\\n', 'accompanied by a commercial depression which extended over a period of\\n', 'ten years. It was in the midst of this crisis that measures of taxation\\n', 'had to be devised to pay the cost of the war, precipitating the quarrel\\n', 'which led to American independence.\\n', '\\n', '=The Expulsion of French Power from North America.=--The effects of the\\n', 'defeat administered to France, as time proved, were difficult to\\n', 'estimate. Some British statesmen regarded it as a happy circumstance\\n', 'that the colonists, already restive under their administration, had no\\n', 'foreign power at hand to aid them in case they struck for independence.\\n', 'American leaders, on the other hand, now that the soldiers of King Louis\\n', 'were driven from the continent, thought that they had no other country\\n', 'to fear if they cast off British sovereignty. At all events, France,\\n', 'though defeated, was not out of the sphere of American influence; for,\\n', 'as events proved, it was the fortunate French alliance negotiated by\\n', 'Franklin that assured the triumph of American arms in the War of the\\n', 'Revolution.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'COLONIAL RELATIONS WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT\\n', '\\n', 'It was neither the Indian wars nor the French wars that finally brought\\n', 'forth American nationality. That was the product of the long strife\\n', 'with the mother country which culminated in union for the war of\\n', 'independence. The forces that created this nation did not operate in the\\n', 'colonies alone. The character of the English sovereigns, the course of\\n', 'events in English domestic politics, and English measures of control\\n', 'over the colonies--executive, legislative, and judicial--must all be\\n', 'taken into account.\\n', '\\n', '=The Last of the Stuarts.=--The struggles between Charles I (1625-49)\\n', 'and the parliamentary party and the turmoil of the Puritan regime\\n', '(1649-60) so engrossed the attention of Englishmen at home that they had\\n', 'little time to think of colonial policies or to interfere with colonial\\n', 'affairs. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660, accompanied by\\n', 'internal peace and the increasing power of the mercantile classes in the\\n', 'House of Commons, changed all that. In the reign of Charles II\\n', '(1660-85), himself an easy-going person, the policy of regulating trade\\n', 'by act of Parliament was developed into a closely knit system and\\n', 'powerful agencies to supervise the colonies were created. At the same\\n', 'time a system of stricter control over the dominions was ushered in by\\n', 'the annulment of the old charter of Massachusetts which conferred so\\n', 'much self-government on the Puritans.\\n', '\\n', \"Charles' successor, James II, a man of sterner stuff and jealous of his\\n\", 'authority in the colonies as well as at home, continued the policy thus\\n', 'inaugurated and enlarged upon it. If he could have kept his throne, he\\n', 'would have bent the Americans under a harsh rule or brought on in his\\n', 'dominions a revolution like that which he precipitated at home in 1688.\\n', 'He determined to unite the Northern colonies and introduce a more\\n', 'efficient administration based on the pattern of the royal provinces. He\\n', 'made a martinet, Sir Edmund Andros, governor of all New England, New\\n', 'York, and New Jersey. The charter of Massachusetts, annulled in the last\\n', \"days of his brother's reign, he continued to ignore, and that of\\n\", 'Connecticut would have been seized if it had not been spirited away and\\n', 'hidden, according to tradition, in a hollow oak.\\n', '\\n', 'For several months, Andros gave the Northern colonies a taste of\\n', 'ill-tempered despotism. He wrung quit rents from land owners not\\n', 'accustomed to feudal dues; he abrogated titles to land where, in his\\n', 'opinion, they were unlawful; he forced the Episcopal service upon the\\n', 'Old South Church in Boston; and he denied the writ of _habeas corpus_ to\\n', 'a preacher who denounced taxation without representation. In the middle\\n', 'of his arbitrary course, however, his hand was stayed. The news came\\n', 'that King James had been dethroned by his angry subjects, and the people\\n', 'of Boston, kindling a fire on Beacon Hill, summoned the countryside to\\n', 'dispose of Andros. The response was prompt and hearty. The hated\\n', 'governor was arrested, imprisoned, and sent back across the sea under\\n', 'guard.\\n', '\\n', 'The overthrow of James, followed by the accession of William and Mary\\n', 'and by assured parliamentary supremacy, had an immediate effect in the\\n', 'colonies. The new order was greeted with thanksgiving. Massachusetts was\\n', 'given another charter which, though not so liberal as the first,\\n', 'restored the spirit if not the entire letter of self-government. In the\\n', 'other colonies where Andros had been operating, the old course of\\n', 'affairs was resumed.\\n', '\\n', '=The Indifference of the First Two Georges.=--On the death in 1714 of\\n', 'Queen Anne, the successor of King William, the throne passed to a\\n', 'Hanoverian prince who, though grateful for English honors and revenues,\\n', 'was more interested in Hanover than in England. George I and George II,\\n', 'whose combined reigns extended from 1714 to 1760, never even learned to\\n', 'speak the English language, at least without an accent. The necessity of\\n', 'taking thought about colonial affairs bored both of them so that the\\n', 'stoutest defender of popular privileges in Boston or Charleston had no\\n', 'ground to complain of the exercise of personal prerogatives by the king.\\n', 'Moreover, during a large part of this period, the direction of affairs\\n', 'was in the hands of an astute leader, Sir Robert Walpole, who betrayed\\n', 'his somewhat cynical view of politics by adopting as his motto: \"Let\\n', 'sleeping dogs lie.\" He revealed his appreciation of popular sentiment\\n', 'by exclaiming: \"I will not be the minister to enforce taxes at the\\n', 'expense of blood.\" Such kings and such ministers were not likely to\\n', 'arouse the slumbering resistance of the thirteen colonies across the\\n', 'sea.\\n', '\\n', '=Control of the Crown over the Colonies.=--While no English ruler from\\n', 'James II to George III ventured to interfere with colonial matters\\n', 'personally, constant control over the colonies was exercised by royal\\n', 'officers acting under the authority of the crown. Systematic supervision\\n', 'began in 1660, when there was created by royal order a committee of the\\n', \"king's council to meet on Mondays and Thursdays of each week to consider\\n\", 'petitions, memorials, and addresses respecting the plantations. In 1696\\n', 'a regular board was established, known as the \"Lords of Trade and\\n', 'Plantations,\" which continued, until the American Revolution, to\\n', 'scrutinize closely colonial business. The chief duties of the board were\\n', 'to examine acts of colonial legislatures, to recommend measures to those\\n', 'assemblies for adoption, and to hear memorials and petitions from the\\n', 'colonies relative to their affairs.\\n', '\\n', 'The methods employed by this board were varied. All laws passed by\\n', 'American legislatures came before it for review as a matter of routine.\\n', 'If it found an act unsatisfactory, it recommended to the king the\\n', 'exercise of his veto power, known as the royal disallowance. Any person\\n', 'who believed his personal or property rights injured by a colonial law\\n', 'could be heard by the board in person or by attorney; in such cases it\\n', 'was the practice to hear at the same time the agent of the colony so\\n', 'involved. The royal veto power over colonial legislation was not,\\n', 'therefore, a formal affair, but was constantly employed on the\\n', 'suggestion of a highly efficient agency of the crown. All this was in\\n', 'addition to the powers exercised by the governors in the royal\\n', 'provinces.\\n', '\\n', '=Judicial Control.=--Supplementing this administrative control over the\\n', 'colonies was a constant supervision by the English courts of law. The\\n', 'king, by virtue of his inherent authority, claimed and exercised high\\n', 'appellate powers over all judicial tribunals in the empire. The right\\n', 'of appeal from local courts, expressly set forth in some charters, was,\\n', 'on the eve of the Revolution, maintained in every colony. Any subject in\\n', 'England or America, who, in the regular legal course, was aggrieved by\\n', 'any act of a colonial legislature or any decision of a colonial court,\\n', 'had the right, subject to certain regulations, to carry his case to the\\n', 'king in council, forcing his opponent to follow him across the sea. In\\n', 'the exercise of appellate power, the king in council acting as a court\\n', 'could, and frequently did, declare acts of colonial legislatures duly\\n', 'enacted and approved, null and void, on the ground that they were\\n', 'contrary to English law.\\n', '\\n', '=Imperial Control in Operation.=--Day after day, week after week, year\\n', 'after year, the machinery for political and judicial control over\\n', 'colonial affairs was in operation. At one time the British governors in\\n', 'the colonies were ordered not to approve any colonial law imposing a\\n', 'duty on European goods imported in English vessels. Again, when North\\n', 'Carolina laid a tax on peddlers, the council objected to it as\\n', '\"restrictive upon the trade and dispersion of English manufactures\\n', 'throughout the continent.\" At other times, Indian trade was regulated in\\n', 'the interests of the whole empire or grants of lands by a colonial\\n', 'legislature were set aside. Virginia was forbidden to close her ports to\\n', 'North Carolina lest there should be retaliation.\\n', '\\n', 'In short, foreign and intercolonial trade were subjected to a control\\n', 'higher than that of the colony, foreshadowing a day when the\\n', 'Constitution of the United States was to commit to Congress the power to\\n', 'regulate interstate and foreign commerce and commerce with the Indians.\\n', 'A superior judicial power, towering above that of the colonies, as the\\n', 'Supreme Court at Washington now towers above the states, kept the\\n', 'colonial legislatures within the metes and bounds of established law. In\\n', 'the thousands of appeals, memorials, petitions, and complaints, and the\\n', 'rulings and decisions upon them, were written the real history of\\n', 'British imperial control over the American colonies.\\n', '\\n', 'So great was the business before the Lords of Trade that the colonies\\n', 'had to keep skilled agents in London to protect their interests. As\\n', 'common grievances against the operation of this machinery of control\\n', 'arose, there appeared in each colony a considerable body of men, with\\n', 'the merchants in the lead, who chafed at the restraints imposed on their\\n', 'enterprise. Only a powerful blow was needed to weld these bodies into a\\n', 'common mass nourishing the spirit of colonial nationalism. When to the\\n', 'repeated minor irritations were added general and sweeping measures of\\n', 'Parliament applying to every colony, the rebound came in the Revolution.\\n', '\\n', '=Parliamentary Control over Colonial Affairs.=--As soon as Parliament\\n', 'gained in power at the expense of the king, it reached out to bring the\\n', 'American colonies under its sway as well. Between the execution of\\n', 'Charles I and the accession of George III, there was enacted an immense\\n', 'body of legislation regulating the shipping, trade, and manufactures of\\n', 'America. All of it, based on the \"mercantile\" theory then prevalent in\\n', 'all countries of Europe, was designed to control the overseas\\n', 'plantations in such a way as to foster the commercial and business\\n', 'interests of the mother country, where merchants and men of finance had\\n', 'got the upper hand. According to this theory, the colonies of the\\n', 'British empire should be confined to agriculture and the production of\\n', 'raw materials, and forced to buy their manufactured goods of England.\\n', '\\n', '_The Navigation Acts._--In the first rank among these measures of\\n', 'British colonial policy must be placed the navigation laws framed for\\n', 'the purpose of building up the British merchant marine and navy--arms so\\n', 'essential in defending the colonies against the Spanish, Dutch, and\\n', 'French. The beginning of this type of legislation was made in 1651 and\\n', 'it was worked out into a system early in the reign of Charles II\\n', '(1660-85).\\n', '\\n', 'The Navigation Acts, in effect, gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to\\n', 'British ships. No trade could be carried on between Great Britain and\\n', 'her dominions save in vessels built and manned by British subjects. No\\n', 'European goods could be brought to America save in the ships of the\\n', 'country that produced them or in English ships. These laws, which were\\n', 'almost fatal to Dutch shipping in America, fell with severity upon the\\n', 'colonists, compelling them to pay higher freight rates. The adverse\\n', 'effect, however, was short-lived, for the measures stimulated\\n', 'shipbuilding in the colonies, where the abundance of raw materials gave\\n', 'the master builders of America an advantage over those of the mother\\n', 'country. Thus the colonists in the end profited from the restrictive\\n', 'policy written into the Navigation Acts.\\n', '\\n', '_The Acts against Manufactures._--The second group of laws was\\n', 'deliberately aimed to prevent colonial industries from competing too\\n', 'sharply with those of England. Among the earliest of these measures may\\n', 'be counted the Woolen Act of 1699, forbidding the exportation of woolen\\n', 'goods from the colonies and even the woolen trade between towns and\\n', 'colonies. When Parliament learned, as the result of an inquiry, that New\\n', 'England and New York were making thousands of hats a year and sending\\n', 'large numbers annually to the Southern colonies and to Ireland, Spain,\\n', 'and Portugal, it enacted in 1732 a law declaring that \"no hats or felts,\\n', 'dyed or undyed, finished or unfinished\" should be \"put upon any vessel\\n', 'or laden upon any horse or cart with intent to export to any place\\n', 'whatever.\" The effect of this measure upon the hat industry was almost\\n', 'ruinous. A few years later a similar blow was given to the iron\\n', 'industry. By an act of 1750, pig and bar iron from the colonies were\\n', 'given free entry to England to encourage the production of the raw\\n', 'material; but at the same time the law provided that \"no mill or other\\n', 'engine for slitting or rolling of iron, no plating forge to work with a\\n', 'tilt hammer, and no furnace for making steel\" should be built in the\\n', 'colonies. As for those already built, they were declared public\\n', 'nuisances and ordered closed. Thus three important economic interests of\\n', 'the colonists, the woolen, hat, and iron industries, were laid under the\\n', 'ban.\\n', '\\n', '_The Trade Laws._--The third group of restrictive measures passed by the\\n', 'British Parliament related to the sale of colonial produce. An act of\\n', '1663 required the colonies to export certain articles to Great Britain\\n', 'or to her dominions alone; while sugar, tobacco, and ginger consigned to\\n', 'the continent of Europe had to pass through a British port paying custom\\n', \"duties and through a British merchant's hands paying the usual\\n\", 'commission. At first tobacco was the only one of the \"enumerated\\n', 'articles\" which seriously concerned the American colonies, the rest\\n', 'coming mainly from the British West Indies. In the course of time,\\n', 'however, other commodities were added to the list of enumerated\\n', 'articles, until by 1764 it embraced rice, naval stores, copper, furs,\\n', 'hides, iron, lumber, and pearl ashes. This was not all. The colonies\\n', 'were compelled to bring their European purchases back through English\\n', 'ports, paying duties to the government and commissions to merchants\\n', 'again.\\n', '\\n', '_The Molasses Act._--Not content with laws enacted in the interest of\\n', 'English merchants and manufacturers, Parliament sought to protect the\\n', 'British West Indies against competition from their French and Dutch\\n', 'neighbors. New England merchants had long carried on a lucrative trade\\n', 'with the French islands in the West Indies and Dutch Guiana, where sugar\\n', 'and molasses could be obtained in large quantities at low prices. Acting\\n', 'on the protests of English planters in the Barbadoes and Jamaica,\\n', 'Parliament, in 1733, passed the famous Molasses Act imposing duties on\\n', 'sugar and molasses imported into the colonies from foreign\\n', 'countries--rates which would have destroyed the American trade with the\\n', 'French and Dutch if the law had been enforced. The duties, however, were\\n', 'not collected. The molasses and sugar trade with the foreigners went on\\n', 'merrily, smuggling taking the place of lawful traffic.\\n', '\\n', '=Effect of the Laws in America.=--As compared with the strict monopoly\\n', 'of her colonial trade which Spain consistently sought to maintain, the\\n', 'policy of England was both moderate and liberal. Furthermore, the\\n', 'restrictive laws were supplemented by many measures intended to be\\n', 'favorable to colonial prosperity. The Navigation Acts, for example,\\n', 'redounded to the advantage of American shipbuilders and the producers\\n', 'of hemp, tar, lumber, and ship stores in general. Favors in British\\n', 'ports were granted to colonial producers as against foreign competitors\\n', 'and in some instances bounties were paid by England to encourage\\n', 'colonial enterprise. Taken all in all, there is much justification in\\n', 'the argument advanced by some modern scholars to the effect that the\\n', 'colonists gained more than they lost by British trade and industrial\\n', 'legislation. Certainly after the establishment of independence, when\\n', 'free from these old restrictions, the Americans found themselves\\n', 'handicapped by being treated as foreigners rather than favored traders\\n', 'and the recipients of bounties in English markets.\\n', '\\n', 'Be that as it may, it appears that the colonists felt little irritation\\n', 'against the mother country on account of the trade and navigation laws\\n', 'enacted previous to the close of the French and Indian war. Relatively\\n', 'few were engaged in the hat and iron industries as compared with those\\n', \"in farming and planting, so that England's policy of restricting America\\n\", 'to agriculture did not conflict with the interests of the majority of\\n', 'the inhabitants. The woolen industry was largely in the hands of women\\n', 'and carried on in connection with their domestic duties, so that it was\\n', 'not the sole support of any considerable number of people.\\n', '\\n', 'As a matter of fact, moreover, the restrictive laws, especially those\\n', 'relating to trade, were not rigidly enforced. Cargoes of tobacco were\\n', 'boldly sent to continental ports without even so much as a bow to the\\n', 'English government, to which duties should have been paid. Sugar and\\n', 'molasses from the French and Dutch colonies were shipped into New\\n', 'England in spite of the law. Royal officers sometimes protested against\\n', 'smuggling and sometimes connived at it; but at no time did they succeed\\n', 'in stopping it. Taken all in all, very little was heard of \"the galling\\n', 'restraints of trade\" until after the French war, when the British\\n', 'government suddenly entered upon a new course.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SUMMARY OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD\\n', '\\n', 'In the period between the landing of the English at Jamestown, Virginia,\\n', 'in 1607, and the close of the French and Indian war in 1763--a period of\\n', 'a century and a half--a new nation was being prepared on this continent\\n', 'to take its place among the powers of the earth. It was an epoch of\\n', 'migration. Western Europe contributed emigrants of many races and\\n', 'nationalities. The English led the way. Next to them in numerical\\n', 'importance were the Scotch-Irish and the Germans. Into the melting pot\\n', 'were also cast Dutch, Swedes, French, Jews, Welsh, and Irish. Thousands\\n', 'of negroes were brought from Africa to till Southern fields or labor as\\n', 'domestic servants in the North.\\n', '\\n', 'Why did they come? The reasons are various. Some of them, the Pilgrims\\n', 'and Puritans of New England, the French Huguenots, Scotch-Irish and\\n', 'Irish, and the Catholics of Maryland, fled from intolerant governments\\n', 'that denied them the right to worship God according to the dictates of\\n', 'their consciences. Thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in\\n', 'the Old World and to find free homes in America. Thousands, like the\\n', 'negroes from Africa, were dragged here against their will. The lure of\\n', 'adventure appealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the\\n', 'enterprising merchants.\\n', '\\n', 'How did they come? In some cases religious brotherhoods banded together\\n', 'and borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way. In other\\n', 'cases great trading companies were organized to found colonies. Again it\\n', 'was the wealthy proprietor, like Lord Baltimore or William Penn, who\\n', 'undertook to plant settlements. Many immigrants were able to pay their\\n', 'own way across the sea. Others bound themselves out for a term of years\\n', 'in exchange for the cost of the passage. Negroes were brought on account\\n', 'of the profits derived from their sale as slaves.\\n', '\\n', 'Whatever the motive for their coming, however, they managed to get\\n', 'across the sea. The immigrants set to work with a will. They cut down\\n', 'forests, built houses, and laid out fields. They founded churches,\\n', 'schools, and colleges. They set up forges and workshops. They spun and\\n', 'wove. They fashioned ships and sailed the seas. They bartered and\\n', 'traded. Here and there on favorable harbors they established centers of\\n', 'commerce--Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and\\n', 'Charleston. As soon as a firm foothold was secured on the shore line\\n', 'they pressed westward until, by the close of the colonial period, they\\n', 'were already on the crest of the Alleghanies.\\n', '\\n', 'Though they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast,\\n', 'the colonists were united in spirit by many common ties. The major\\n', 'portion of them were Protestants. The language, the law, and the\\n', 'literature of England furnished the basis of national unity. Most of the\\n', 'colonists were engaged in the same hard task; that of conquering a\\n', 'wilderness. To ties of kinship and language were added ties created by\\n', 'necessity. They had to unite in defense; first, against the Indians and\\n', 'later against the French. They were all subjects of the same\\n', 'sovereign--the king of England. The English Parliament made laws for\\n', 'them and the English government supervised their local affairs, their\\n', 'trade, and their manufactures. Common forces assailed them. Common\\n', 'grievances vexed them. Common hopes inspired them.\\n', '\\n', 'Many of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw\\n', 'them into opposition to the British Crown and Parliament. Most of them\\n', 'were freeholders; that is, farmers who owned their own land and tilled\\n', 'it with their own hands. A free soil nourished the spirit of freedom.\\n', 'The majority of them were Dissenters, critics, not friends, of the\\n', 'Church of England, that stanch defender of the British monarchy. Each\\n', 'colony in time developed its own legislature elected by the voters; it\\n', 'grew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself. Here was a\\n', 'people learning self-reliance and self-government. The attempts to\\n', 'strengthen the Church of England in America and the transformation of\\n', 'colonies into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence\\n', 'which they were designed to quench.\\n', '\\n', 'Nevertheless, the Americans owed much of their prosperity to the\\n', 'assistance of the government that irritated them. It was the protection\\n', 'of the British navy that prevented Holland, Spain, and France from\\n', 'wiping out their settlements. Though their manufacture and trade were\\n', 'controlled in the interests of the mother country, they also enjoyed\\n', 'great advantages in her markets. Free trade existed nowhere upon the\\n', 'earth; but the broad empire of Britain was open to American ships and\\n', 'merchandise. It could be said, with good reason, that the disadvantages\\n', 'which the colonists suffered through British regulation of their\\n', 'industry and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed.\\n', 'Still that is somewhat beside the point, for mere economic advantage is\\n', 'not necessarily the determining factor in the fate of peoples. A\\n', 'thousand circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation,\\n', 'to inspire it with a passion for independence, and to prepare it for a\\n', 'destiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the British\\n', 'empire. The economists, who tried to prove by logic unassailable that\\n', 'America would be richer under the British flag, could not change the\\n', 'spirit of Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, or George\\n', 'Washington.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', 'G.L.

The first George, the son of the Elector of Hanover\\n', 'and Sophia the granddaughter of James I, was a thorough German who never\\n', 'even learned to speak the language of the land over which he reigned.\\n', 'The second George never saw England until he was a man. He spoke English\\n', 'with an accent and until his death preferred his German home. During\\n', 'their reign, the principle had become well established that the king did\\n', 'not govern but acted only through ministers representing the majority in\\n', 'Parliament.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'GEORGE III AND HIS SYSTEM\\n', '\\n', '=The Character of the New King.=--The third George rudely broke the\\n', 'German tradition of his family. He resented the imputation that he was a\\n', 'foreigner and on all occasions made a display of his British sympathies.\\n', 'To the draft of his first speech to Parliament, he added the popular\\n', 'phrase: \"Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of\\n', 'Briton.\" Macaulay, the English historian, certainly of no liking for\\n', 'high royal prerogative, said of George: \"The young king was a born\\n', 'Englishman. All his tastes and habits, good and bad, were English. No\\n', 'portion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with.... His age,\\n', 'his appearance, and all that was known of his character conciliated\\n', 'public favor. He was in the bloom of youth; his person and address were\\n', 'pleasing; scandal imputed to him no vice; and flattery might without\\n', 'glaring absurdity ascribe to him many princely virtues.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Nevertheless George III had been spoiled by his mother, his tutors, and\\n', 'his courtiers. Under their influence he developed high and mighty\\n', 'notions about the sacredness of royal authority and his duty to check\\n', 'the pretensions of Parliament and the ministers dependent upon it. His\\n', 'mother had dinned into his ears the slogan: \"George, be king!\" Lord\\n', 'Bute, his teacher and adviser, had told him that his honor required him\\n', 'to take an active part in the shaping of public policy and the making of\\n', 'laws. Thus educated, he surrounded himself with courtiers who encouraged\\n', 'him in the determination to rule as well as reign, to subdue all\\n', 'parties, and to place himself at the head of the nation and empire.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print._\\n', '\\n', 'GEORGE III]\\n', '\\n', '=Political Parties and George III.=--The state of the political parties\\n', 'favored the plans of the king to restore some of the ancient luster of\\n', 'the crown. The Whigs, who were composed mainly of the smaller\\n', 'freeholders, merchants, inhabitants of towns, and Protestant\\n', 'non-conformists, had grown haughty and overbearing through long\\n', 'continuance in power and had as a consequence raised up many enemies in\\n', 'their own ranks. Their opponents, the Tories, had by this time given up\\n', 'all hope of restoring to the throne the direct Stuart line; but they\\n', 'still cherished their old notions about divine right. With the\\n', 'accession of George III the coveted opportunity came to them to rally\\n', 'around the throne again. George received his Tory friends with open\\n', 'arms, gave them offices, and bought them seats in the House of Commons.\\n', '\\n', '=The British Parliamentary System.=--The peculiarities of the British\\n', 'Parliament at the time made smooth the way for the king and his allies\\n', 'with their designs for controlling the entire government. In the first\\n', 'place, the House of Lords was composed mainly of hereditary nobles whose\\n', 'number the king could increase by the appointment of his favorites, as\\n', 'of old. Though the members of the House of Commons were elected by\\n', 'popular vote, they did not speak for the mass of English people. Great\\n', 'towns like Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, for example, had no\\n', 'representatives at all. While there were about eight million inhabitants\\n', 'in Great Britain, there were in 1768 only about 160,000 voters; that is\\n', 'to say, only about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the\\n', 'government. Many boroughs returned one or more members to the Commons\\n', 'although they had merely a handful of voters or in some instances no\\n', 'voters at all. Furthermore, these tiny boroughs were often controlled by\\n', 'lords who openly sold the right of representation to the highest bidder.\\n', 'The \"rotten-boroughs,\" as they were called by reformers, were a public\\n', 'scandal, but George III readily made use of them to get his friends into\\n', 'the House of Commons.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"GEORGE III'S MINISTERS AND THEIR COLONIAL POLICIES\\n\", '\\n', '=Grenville and the War Debt.=--Within a year after the accession of\\n', 'George III, William Pitt was turned out of office, the king treating him\\n', 'with \"gross incivility\" and the crowds shouting \"Pitt forever!\" The\\n', \"direction of affairs was entrusted to men enjoying the king's\\n\", 'confidence. Leadership in the House of Commons fell to George Grenville,\\n', 'a grave and laborious man who for years had groaned over the increasing\\n', 'cost of government.\\n', '\\n', 'The first task after the conclusion of peace in 1763 was the adjustment\\n', 'of the disordered finances of the kingdom. The debt stood at the highest\\n', 'point in the history of the country. More revenue was absolutely\\n', 'necessary and Grenville began to search for it, turning his attention\\n', 'finally to the American colonies. In this quest he had the aid of a\\n', 'zealous colleague, Charles Townshend, who had long been in public\\n', 'service and was familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal\\n', 'governors in America. These two men, with the support of the entire\\n', 'ministry, inaugurated in February, 1763, \"a new system of colonial\\n', 'government. It was announced by authority that there were to be no more\\n', 'requisitions from the king to the colonial assemblies for supplies, but\\n', 'that the colonies were to be taxed instead by act of Parliament.\\n', 'Colonial governors and judges were to be paid by the Crown; they were to\\n', 'be supported by a standing army of twenty regiments; and all the\\n', 'expenses of this force were to be met by parliamentary taxation.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Restriction of Paper Money (1763).=--Among the many complaints filed\\n', 'before the board of trade were vigorous protests against the issuance of\\n', 'paper money by the colonial legislatures. The new ministry provided a\\n', 'remedy in the act of 1763, which declared void all colonial laws\\n', 'authorizing paper money or extending the life of outstanding bills. This\\n', 'law was aimed at the \"cheap money\" which the Americans were fond of\\n', 'making when specie was scarce--money which they tried to force on their\\n', 'English creditors in return for goods and in payment of the interest and\\n', 'principal of debts. Thus the first chapter was written in the long\\n', 'battle over sound money on this continent.\\n', '\\n', '=Limitation on Western Land Sales.=--Later in the same year (1763)\\n', 'George III issued a royal proclamation providing, among other things,\\n', 'for the government of the territory recently acquired by the treaty of\\n', 'Paris from the French. One of the provisions in this royal decree\\n', \"touched frontiersmen to the quick. The contests between the king's\\n\", 'officers and the colonists over the disposition of western lands had\\n', 'been long and sharp. The Americans chafed at restrictions on\\n', 'settlement. The more adventurous were continually moving west and\\n', '\"squatting\" on land purchased from the Indians or simply seized without\\n', 'authority. To put an end to this, the king forbade all further purchases\\n', 'from the Indians, reserving to the crown the right to acquire such lands\\n', 'and dispose of them for settlement. A second provision in the same\\n', 'proclamation vested the power of licensing trade with the Indians,\\n', 'including the lucrative fur business, in the hands of royal officers in\\n', 'the colonies. These two limitations on American freedom and enterprise\\n', 'were declared to be in the interest of the crown and for the\\n', 'preservation of the rights of the Indians against fraud and abuses.\\n', '\\n', \"=The Sugar Act of 1764.=--King George's ministers next turned their\\n\", 'attention to measures of taxation and trade. Since the heavy debt under\\n', 'which England was laboring had been largely incurred in the defense of\\n', 'America, nothing seemed more reasonable to them than the proposition\\n', 'that the colonies should help to bear the burden which fell so heavily\\n', 'upon the English taxpayer. The Sugar Act of 1764 was the result of this\\n', 'reasoning. There was no doubt about the purpose of this law, for it was\\n', 'set forth clearly in the title: \"An act for granting certain duties in\\n', 'the British colonies and plantations in America ... for applying the\\n', 'produce of such duties ... towards defraying the expenses of defending,\\n', 'protecting and securing the said colonies and plantations ... and for\\n', 'more effectually preventing the clandestine conveyance of goods to and\\n', 'from the said colonies and plantations and improving and securing the\\n', 'trade between the same and Great Britain.\" The old Molasses Act had been\\n', 'prohibitive; the Sugar Act of 1764 was clearly intended as a revenue\\n', 'measure. Specified duties were laid upon sugar, indigo, calico, silks,\\n', 'and many other commodities imported into the colonies. The enforcement\\n', 'of the Molasses Act had been utterly neglected; but this Sugar Act had\\n', '\"teeth in it.\" Special precautions as to bonds, security, and\\n', 'registration of ship masters, accompanied by heavy penalties, promised\\n', 'a vigorous execution of the new revenue law.\\n', '\\n', 'The strict terms of the Sugar Act were strengthened by administrative\\n', 'measures. Under a law of the previous year the commanders of armed\\n', 'vessels stationed along the American coast were authorized to stop,\\n', 'search, and, on suspicion, seize merchant ships approaching colonial\\n', 'ports. By supplementary orders, the entire British official force in\\n', 'America was instructed to be diligent in the execution of all trade and\\n', 'navigation laws. Revenue collectors, officers of the army and navy, and\\n', 'royal governors were curtly ordered to the front to do their full duty\\n', 'in the matter of law enforcement. The ordinary motives for the discharge\\n', 'of official obligations were sharpened by an appeal to avarice, for\\n', 'naval officers who seized offenders against the law were rewarded by\\n', 'large prizes out of the forfeitures and penalties.\\n', '\\n', '=The Stamp Act (1765).=--The Grenville-Townshend combination moved\\n', 'steadily towards its goal. While the Sugar Act was under consideration\\n', 'in Parliament, Grenville announced a plan for a stamp bill. The next\\n', 'year it went through both Houses with a speed that must have astounded\\n', 'its authors. The vote in the Commons stood 205 in favor to 49 against;\\n', 'while in the Lords it was not even necessary to go through the formality\\n', 'of a count. As George III was temporarily insane, the measure received\\n', 'royal assent by a commission acting as a board of regency. Protests of\\n', 'colonial agents in London were futile. \"We might as well have hindered\\n', 'the sun\\'s progress!\" exclaimed Franklin. Protests of a few opponents in\\n', 'the Commons were equally vain. The ministry was firm in its course and\\n', 'from all appearances the Stamp Act hardly roused as much as a languid\\n', 'interest in the city of London. In fact, it is recorded that the fateful\\n', 'measure attracted less notice than a bill providing for a commission to\\n', 'act for the king when he was incapacitated.\\n', '\\n', 'The Stamp Act, like the Sugar Act, declared the purpose of the British\\n', 'government to raise revenue in America \"towards defraying the expenses\\n', 'of defending, protecting, and securing the British colonies and\\n', 'plantations in America.\" It was a long measure of more than fifty\\n', 'sections, carefully planned and skillfully drawn. By its provisions\\n', 'duties were imposed on practically all papers used in legal\\n', 'transactions,--deeds, mortgages, inventories, writs, bail bonds,--on\\n', 'licenses to practice law and sell liquor, on college diplomas, playing\\n', 'cards, dice, pamphlets, newspapers, almanacs, calendars, and\\n', 'advertisements. The drag net was closely knit, for scarcely anything\\n', 'escaped.\\n', '\\n', '=The Quartering Act (1765).=--The ministers were aware that the Stamp\\n', 'Act would rouse opposition in America--how great they could not\\n', 'conjecture. While the measure was being debated, a friend of General\\n', 'Wolfe, Colonel Barre, who knew America well, gave them an ominous\\n', 'warning in the Commons. \"Believe me--remember I this day told you so--\"\\n', 'he exclaimed, \"the same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at\\n', 'first will accompany them still ... a people jealous of their liberties\\n', 'and who will vindicate them, if ever they should be violated.\" The\\n', 'answer of the ministry to a prophecy of force was a threat of force.\\n', 'Preparations were accordingly made to dispatch a larger number of\\n', 'soldiers than usual to the colonies, and the ink was hardly dry on the\\n', 'Stamp Act when Parliament passed the Quartering Act ordering the\\n', 'colonists to provide accommodations for the soldiers who were to enforce\\n', 'the new laws. \"We have the power to tax them,\" said one of the ministry,\\n', '\"and we will tax them.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'COLONIAL RESISTANCE FORCES REPEAL\\n', '\\n', '=Popular Opposition.=--The Stamp Act was greeted in America by an\\n', 'outburst of denunciation. The merchants of the seaboard cities took the\\n', 'lead in making a dignified but unmistakable protest, agreeing not to\\n', 'import British goods while the hated law stood upon the books. Lawyers,\\n', 'some of them incensed at the heavy taxes on their operations and others\\n', 'intimidated by patriots who refused to permit them to use stamped\\n', 'papers, joined with the merchants. Aristocratic colonial Whigs, who had\\n', 'long grumbled at the administration of royal governors, protested\\n', 'against taxation without their consent, as the Whigs had done in old\\n', 'England. There were Tories, however, in the colonies as in England--many\\n', 'of them of the official class--who denounced the merchants, lawyers, and\\n', 'Whig aristocrats as \"seditious, factious and republican.\" Yet the\\n', 'opposition to the Stamp Act and its accompanying measure, the Quartering\\n', 'Act, grew steadily all through the summer of 1765.\\n', '\\n', 'In a little while it was taken up in the streets and along the\\n', 'countryside. All through the North and in some of the Southern colonies,\\n', 'there sprang up, as if by magic, committees and societies pledged to\\n', 'resist the Stamp Act to the bitter end. These popular societies were\\n', 'known as Sons of Liberty and Daughters of Liberty: the former including\\n', 'artisans, mechanics, and laborers; and the latter, patriotic women. Both\\n', 'groups were alike in that they had as yet taken little part in public\\n', 'affairs. Many artisans, as well as all the women, were excluded from the\\n', 'right to vote for colonial assemblymen.\\n', '\\n', 'While the merchants and Whig gentlemen confined their efforts chiefly to\\n', 'drafting well-phrased protests against British measures, the Sons of\\n', 'Liberty operated in the streets and chose rougher measures. They stirred\\n', 'up riots in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston when attempts\\n', 'were made to sell the stamps. They sacked and burned the residences of\\n', 'high royal officers. They organized committees of inquisition who by\\n', 'threats and intimidation curtailed the sale of British goods and the use\\n', 'of stamped papers. In fact, the Sons of Liberty carried their operations\\n', 'to such excesses that many mild opponents of the stamp tax were\\n', 'frightened and drew back in astonishment at the forces they had\\n', 'unloosed. The Daughters of Liberty in a quieter way were making a very\\n', 'effective resistance to the sale of the hated goods by spurring on\\n', 'domestic industries, their own particular province being the manufacture\\n', 'of clothing, and devising substitutes for taxed foods. They helped to\\n', 'feed and clothe their families without buying British goods.\\n', '\\n', '=Legislative Action against the Stamp Act.=--Leaders in the colonial\\n', 'assemblies, accustomed to battle against British policies, supported the\\n', 'popular protest. The Stamp Act was signed on March 22, 1765. On May 30,\\n', 'the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a set of resolutions declaring\\n', 'that the General Assembly of the colony alone had the right to lay taxes\\n', 'upon the inhabitants and that attempts to impose them otherwise were\\n', '\"illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust.\" It was in support of these\\n', 'resolutions that Patrick Henry uttered the immortal challenge: \"Caesar\\n', 'had his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and George III....\" Cries of\\n', '\"Treason\" were calmly met by the orator who finished: \"George III may\\n', 'profit by their example. If that be treason, make the most of it.\"\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: PATRICK HENRY]\\n', '\\n', '=The Stamp Act Congress.=--The Massachusetts Assembly answered the call\\n', 'of Virginia by inviting the colonies to elect delegates to a Congress to\\n', 'be held in New York to discuss the situation. Nine colonies responded\\n', 'and sent representatives. The delegates, while professing the warmest\\n', \"affection for the king's person and government, firmly spread on record\\n\", 'a series of resolutions that admitted of no double meaning. They\\n', 'declared that taxes could not be imposed without their consent, given\\n', 'through their respective colonial assemblies; that the Stamp Act showed\\n', 'a tendency to subvert their rights and liberties; that the recent trade\\n', 'acts were burdensome and grievous; and that the right to petition the\\n', 'king and Parliament was their heritage. They thereupon made \"humble\\n', 'supplication\" for the repeal of the Stamp Act.\\n', '\\n', 'The Stamp Act Congress was more than an assembly of protest. It marked\\n', 'the rise of a new agency of government to express the will of America.\\n', 'It was the germ of a government which in time was to supersede the\\n', 'government of George III in the colonies. It foreshadowed the Congress\\n', 'of the United States under the Constitution. It was a successful attempt\\n', 'at union. \"There ought to be no New England men,\" declared Christopher\\n', 'Gadsden, in the Stamp Act Congress, \"no New Yorkers known on the\\n', 'Continent, but all of us Americans.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Repeal of the Stamp Act and the Sugar Act.=--The effect of American\\n', 'resistance on opinion in England was telling. Commerce with the colonies\\n', 'had been effectively boycotted by the Americans; ships lay idly swinging\\n', 'at the wharves; bankruptcy threatened hundreds of merchants in London,\\n', 'Bristol, and Liverpool. Workingmen in the manufacturing towns of England\\n', 'were thrown out of employment. The government had sown folly and was\\n', 'reaping, in place of the coveted revenue, rebellion.\\n', '\\n', 'Perplexed by the storm they had raised, the ministers summoned to the\\n', 'bar of the House of Commons, Benjamin Franklin, the agent for\\n', 'Pennsylvania, who was in London. \"Do you think it right,\" asked\\n', 'Grenville, \"that America should be protected by this country and pay no\\n', 'part of the expenses?\" The answer was brief: \"That is not the case; the\\n', 'colonies raised, clothed, and paid during the last war twenty-five\\n', 'thousand men and spent many millions.\" Then came an inquiry whether the\\n', 'colonists would accept a modified stamp act. \"No, never,\" replied\\n', 'Franklin, \"never! They will never submit to it!\" It was next suggested\\n', 'that military force might compel obedience to law. Franklin had a ready\\n', 'answer. \"They cannot force a man to take stamps.... They may not find a\\n', 'rebellion; they may, indeed, make one.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The repeal of the Stamp Act was moved in the House of Commons a few days\\n', 'later. The sponsor for the repeal spoke of commerce interrupted, debts\\n', 'due British merchants placed in jeopardy, Manchester industries closed,\\n', 'workingmen unemployed, oppression instituted, and the loss of the\\n', 'colonies threatened. Pitt and Edmund Burke, the former near the close\\n', 'of his career, the latter just beginning his, argued cogently in favor\\n', 'of retracing the steps taken the year before. Grenville refused.\\n', '\"America must learn,\" he wailed, \"that prayers are not to be brought to\\n', 'Caesar through riot and sedition.\" His protests were idle. The Commons\\n', 'agreed to the repeal on February 22, 1766, amid the cheers of the\\n', 'victorious majority. It was carried through the Lords in the face of\\n', 'strong opposition and, on March 18, reluctantly signed by the king, now\\n', 'restored to his right mind.\\n', '\\n', 'In rescinding the Stamp Act, Parliament did not admit the contention of\\n', 'the Americans that it was without power to tax them. On the contrary, it\\n', 'accompanied the repeal with a Declaratory Act. It announced that the\\n', 'colonies were subordinate to the crown and Parliament of Great Britain;\\n', 'that the king and Parliament therefore had undoubted authority to make\\n', 'laws binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever; and that the\\n', 'resolutions and proceedings of the colonists denying such authority were\\n', 'null and void.\\n', '\\n', 'The repeal was greeted by the colonists with great popular\\n', 'demonstrations. Bells were rung; toasts to the king were drunk; and\\n', 'trade resumed its normal course. The Declaratory Act, as a mere paper\\n', 'resolution, did not disturb the good humor of those who again cheered\\n', 'the name of King George. Their confidence was soon strengthened by the\\n', 'news that even the Sugar Act had been repealed, thus practically\\n', 'restoring the condition of affairs before Grenville and Townshend\\n', 'inaugurated their policy of \"thoroughness.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'RESUMPTION OF BRITISH REVENUE AND COMMERCIAL POLICIES\\n', '\\n', '=The Townshend Acts (1767).=--The triumph of the colonists was brief.\\n', 'Though Pitt, the friend of America, was once more prime minister, and\\n', 'seated in the House of Lords as the Earl of Chatham, his severe illness\\n', 'gave to Townshend and the Tory party practical control over Parliament.\\n', 'Unconvinced by the experience with the Stamp Act, Townshend brought\\n', 'forward and pushed through both Houses of Parliament three measures,\\n', 'which to this day are associated with his name. First among his\\n', 'restrictive laws was that of June 29, 1767, which placed the enforcement\\n', 'of the collection of duties and customs on colonial imports and exports\\n', 'in the hands of British commissioners appointed by the king, resident in\\n', 'the colonies, paid from the British treasury, and independent of all\\n', 'control by the colonists. The second measure of the same date imposed a\\n', 'tax on lead, glass, paint, tea, and a few other articles imported into\\n', 'the colonies, the revenue derived from the duties to be applied toward\\n', 'the payment of the salaries and other expenses of royal colonial\\n', 'officials. A third measure was the Tea Act of July 2, 1767, aimed at the\\n', 'tea trade which the Americans carried on illegally with foreigners. This\\n', 'law abolished the duty which the East India Company had to pay in\\n', 'England on tea exported to America, for it was thought that English tea\\n', 'merchants might thus find it possible to undersell American tea\\n', 'smugglers.\\n', '\\n', '=Writs of Assistance Legalized by Parliament.=--Had Parliament been\\n', 'content with laying duties, just as a manifestation of power and right,\\n', 'and neglected their collection, perhaps little would have been heard of\\n', 'the Townshend Acts. It provided, however, for the strict, even the\\n', 'harsh, enforcement of the law. It ordered customs officers to remain at\\n', 'their posts and put an end to smuggling. In the revenue act of June 29,\\n', '1767, it expressly authorized the superior courts of the colonies to\\n', 'issue \"writs of assistance,\" empowering customs officers to enter \"any\\n', 'house, warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place in the British colonies\\n', 'or plantations in America to search for and seize\" prohibited or\\n', 'smuggled goods.\\n', '\\n', 'The writ of assistance, which was a general search warrant issued to\\n', 'revenue officers, was an ancient device hateful to a people who\\n', 'cherished the spirit of personal independence and who had made actual\\n', 'gains in the practice of civil liberty. To allow a \"minion of the law\"\\n', \"to enter a man's house and search his papers and premises, was too much\\n\", 'for the emotions of people who had fled to America in a quest for\\n', 'self-government and free homes, who had braved such hardships to\\n', 'establish them, and who wanted to trade without official interference.\\n', '\\n', 'The writ of assistance had been used in Massachusetts in 1755 to prevent\\n', 'illicit trade with Canada and had aroused a violent hostility at that\\n', 'time. In 1761 it was again the subject of a bitter controversy which\\n', 'arose in connection with the application of a customs officer to a\\n', 'Massachusetts court for writs of assistance \"as usual.\" This application\\n', \"was vainly opposed by James Otis in a speech of five hours' duration--a\\n\", 'speech of such fire and eloquence that it sent every man who heard it\\n', 'away \"ready to take up arms against writs of assistance.\" Otis denounced\\n', 'the practice as an exercise of arbitrary power which had cost one king\\n', \"his head and another his throne, a tyrant's device which placed the\\n\", 'liberty of every man in jeopardy, enabling any petty officer to work\\n', 'possible malice on any innocent citizen on the merest suspicion, and to\\n', 'spread terror and desolation through the land. \"What a scene,\" he\\n', 'exclaimed, \"does this open! Every man, prompted by revenge, ill-humor,\\n', \"or wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbor's house, may get a\\n\", 'writ of assistance. Others will ask it from self-defense; one arbitrary\\n', 'exertion will provoke another until society is involved in tumult and\\n', 'blood.\" He did more than attack the writ itself. He said that Parliament\\n', 'could not establish it because it was against the British constitution.\\n', 'This was an assertion resting on slender foundation, but it was quickly\\n', 'echoed by the people. Then and there James Otis sounded the call to\\n', 'America to resist the exercise of arbitrary power by royal officers.\\n', '\"Then and there,\" wrote John Adams, \"the child Independence was born.\"\\n', 'Such was the hated writ that Townshend proposed to put into the hands of\\n', 'customs officers in his grim determination to enforce the law.\\n', '\\n', \"=The New York Assembly Suspended.=--In the very month that Townshend's\\n\", 'Acts were signed by the king, Parliament took a still more drastic step.\\n', 'The assembly of New York, protesting against the \"ruinous and\\n', 'insupportable\" expense involved, had failed to make provision for the\\n', 'care of British troops in accordance with the terms of the Quartering\\n', 'Act. Parliament therefore suspended the assembly until it promised to\\n', 'obey the law. It was not until a third election was held that compliance\\n', 'with the Quartering Act was wrung from the reluctant province.

At his suggestion the assembly adopted a\\n', 'Circular Letter addressed to the assemblies of the other colonies\\n', 'informing them of the state of affairs in Massachusetts and roundly\\n', 'condemning the whole British program. The Circular Letter declared that\\n', 'Parliament had no right to lay taxes on Americans without their consent\\n', 'and that the colonists could not, from the nature of the case, be\\n', 'represented in Parliament. It went on shrewdly to submit to\\n', 'consideration the question as to whether any people could be called free\\n', 'who were subjected to governors and judges appointed by the crown and\\n', 'paid out of funds raised independently. It invited the other colonies,\\n', 'in the most temperate tones, to take thought about the common\\n', 'predicament in which they were all placed.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print._\\n', '\\n', 'SAMUEL ADAMS]\\n', '\\n', '=The Dissolution of Assemblies.=--The governor of Massachusetts, hearing\\n', 'of the Circular Letter, ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal. On\\n', 'meeting refusal, he promptly dissolved it. The Maryland, Georgia, and\\n', 'South Carolina assemblies indorsed the Circular Letter and were also\\n', 'dissolved at once. The Virginia House of Burgesses, thoroughly aroused,\\n', 'passed resolutions on May 16, 1769, declaring that the sole right of\\n', 'imposing taxes in Virginia was vested in its legislature, asserting anew\\n', 'the right of petition to the crown, condemning the transportation of\\n', 'persons accused of crimes or trial beyond the seas, and beseeching the\\n', 'king for a redress of the general grievances. The immediate dissolution\\n', 'of the Virginia assembly, in its turn, was the answer of the royal\\n', 'governor.\\n', '\\n', '=The Boston Massacre.=--American opposition to the British authorities\\n', 'kept steadily rising as assemblies were dissolved, the houses of\\n', 'citizens searched, and troops distributed in increasing numbers among\\n', 'the centers of discontent. Merchants again agreed not to import British\\n', 'goods, the Sons of Liberty renewed their agitation, and women set about\\n', 'the patronage of home products still more loyally.\\n', '\\n', 'On the night of March 5, 1770, a crowd on the streets of Boston began to\\n', 'jostle and tease some British regulars stationed in the town. Things\\n', 'went from bad to worse until some \"boys and young fellows\" began to\\n', 'throw snowballs and stones. Then the exasperated soldiers fired into the\\n', 'crowd, killing five and wounding half a dozen more. The day after the\\n', '\"massacre,\" a mass meeting was held in the town and Samuel Adams was\\n', 'sent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers. The governor hesitated\\n', 'and tried to compromise. Finding Adams relentless, the governor yielded\\n', 'and ordered the regulars away.\\n', '\\n', 'The Boston Massacre stirred the country from New Hampshire to Georgia.\\n', 'Popular passions ran high. The guilty soldiers were charged with murder.\\n', 'Their defense was undertaken, in spite of the wrath of the populace, by\\n', 'John Adams and Josiah Quincy, who as lawyers thought even the worst\\n', '\\n', 'offenders entitled to their full rights in law. In his speech to the\\n', 'jury, however, Adams warned the British government against its course,\\n', 'saying, that \"from the nature of things soldiers quartered in a populous\\n', 'town will always occasion two mobs where they will prevent one.\" Two of\\n', 'the soldiers were convicted and lightly punished.\\n', '\\n', '=Resistance in the South.=--The year following the Boston Massacre some\\n', 'citizens of North Carolina, goaded by the conduct of the royal governor,\\n', 'openly resisted his authority. Many were killed as a result and seven\\n', 'who were taken prisoners were hanged as traitors. A little later royal\\n', 'troops and local militia met in a pitched battle near Alamance River,\\n', 'called the \"Lexington of the South.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The _Gaspee_ Affair and the Virginia Resolutions of 1773.=--On sea as\\n', 'well as on land, friction between the royal officers and the colonists\\n', 'broke out into overt acts. While patrolling Narragansett Bay looking for\\n', 'smugglers one day in 1772, the armed ship, _Gaspee_, ran ashore and was\\n', 'caught fast. During the night several men from Providence boarded the\\n', 'vessel and, after seizing the crew, set it on fire. A royal commission,\\n', 'sent to Rhode Island to discover the offenders and bring them to\\n', 'account, failed because it could not find a single informer. The very\\n', 'appointment of such a commission aroused the patriots of Virginia to\\n', 'action; and in March, 1773, the House of Burgesses passed a resolution\\n', 'creating a standing committee of correspondence to develop cooperation\\n', 'among the colonies in resistance to British measures.\\n', '\\n', '=The Boston Tea Party.=--Although the British government, finding the\\n', 'Townshend revenue act a failure, repealed in 1770 all the duties except\\n', 'that on tea, it in no way relaxed its resolve to enforce the other\\n', 'commercial regulations it had imposed on the colonies. Moreover,\\n', 'Parliament decided to relieve the British East India Company of the\\n', 'financial difficulties into which it had fallen partly by reason of the\\n', 'Tea Act and the colonial boycott that followed. In 1773 it agreed to\\n', 'return to the Company the regular import duties, levied in England, on\\n', 'all tea transshipped to America. A small impost of three pence, to be\\n', 'collected in America, was left as a reminder of the principle laid down\\n', 'in the Declaratory Act that Parliament had the right to tax the\\n', 'colonists.\\n', '\\n', 'This arrangement with the East India Company was obnoxious to the\\n', 'colonists for several reasons. It was an act of favoritism for one\\n', 'thing, in the interest of a great monopoly. For another thing, it\\n', 'promised to dump on the American market, suddenly, an immense amount of\\n', 'cheap tea and so cause heavy losses to American merchants who had large\\n', 'stocks on hand. It threatened with ruin the business of all those who\\n', 'were engaged in clandestine trade with the Dutch. It carried with it an\\n', 'irritating tax of three pence on imports. In Charleston, Annapolis, New\\n', 'York, and Boston, captains of ships who brought tea under this act were\\n', 'roughly handled. One night in December, 1773, a band of Boston citizens,\\n', 'disguised as Indians, boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the cargo\\n', 'into the harbor. This was serious business, for it was open, flagrant,\\n', 'determined violation of the law. As such the British government viewed\\n', 'it.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'RETALIATION BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT\\n', '\\n', '=Reception of the News of the Tea Riot.=--The news of the tea riot in\\n', 'Boston confirmed King George in his conviction that there should be no\\n', 'soft policy in dealing with his American subjects. \"The die is cast,\" he\\n', 'stated with evident satisfaction. \"The colonies must either triumph or\\n', 'submit.... If we take the resolute part, they will undoubtedly be very\\n', 'meek.\" Lord George Germain characterized the tea party as \"the\\n', 'proceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble who ought, if they had\\n', 'the least prudence, to follow their mercantile employments and not\\n', 'trouble themselves with politics and government, which they do not\\n', 'understand.\" This expressed, in concise form, exactly the sentiments of\\n', \"Lord North, who had then for three years been the king's chief minister.\\n\", 'Even Pitt, Lord Chatham, was prepared to support the government in\\n', 'upholding its authority.\\n', '\\n', '=The Five Intolerable Acts.=--Parliament, beginning on March 31, 1774,\\n', 'passed five stringent measures, known in American history as the five\\n', '\"intolerable acts.\" They were aimed at curing the unrest in America. The\\n', '_first_ of them was a bill absolutely shutting the port of Boston to\\n', 'commerce with the outside world. The _second_, following closely,\\n', 'revoked the Massachusetts charter of 1691 and provided furthermore that\\n', 'the councilors should be appointed by the king, that all judges should\\n', 'be named by the royal governor, and that town meetings (except to elect\\n', \"certain officers) could not be held without the governor's consent. A\\n\", '_third_ measure, after denouncing the \"utter subversion of all lawful\\n', 'government\" in the provinces, authorized royal agents to transfer to\\n', 'Great Britain or to other colonies the trials of officers or other\\n', 'persons accused of murder in connection with the enforcement of the law.\\n', 'The _fourth_ act legalized the quartering of troops in Massachusetts\\n', 'towns. The _fifth_ of the measures was the Quebec Act, which granted\\n', 'religious toleration to the Catholics in Canada, extended the boundaries\\n', 'of Quebec southward to the Ohio River, and established, in this western\\n', 'region, government by a viceroy.\\n', '\\n', 'The intolerable acts went through Parliament with extraordinary\\n', 'celerity. There was an opposition, alert and informed; but it was\\n', 'ineffective. Burke spoke eloquently against the Boston port bill,\\n', 'condemning it roundly for punishing the innocent with the guilty, and\\n', 'showing how likely it was to bring grave consequences in its train. He\\n', 'was heard with respect and his pleas were rejected. The bill passed both\\n', 'houses without a division, the entry \"unanimous\" being made upon their\\n', 'journals although it did not accurately represent the state of opinion.\\n', 'The law destroying the charter of Massachusetts passed the Commons by a\\n', 'vote of three to one; and the third intolerable act by a vote of four to\\n', 'one. The triumph of the ministry was complete. \"What passed in Boston,\"\\n', 'exclaimed the great jurist, Lord Mansfield, \"is the overt act of High\\n', 'Treason proceeding from our over lenity and want of foresight.\" The\\n', 'crown and Parliament were united in resorting to punitive measures.\\n', '\\n', 'In the colonies the laws were received with consternation. To the\\n', 'American Protestants, the Quebec Act was the most offensive. That\\n', 'project they viewed not as an act of grace or of mercy but as a direct\\n', 'attempt to enlist French Canadians on the side of Great Britain. The\\n', 'British government did not grant religious toleration to Catholics\\n', 'either at home or in Ireland and the Americans could see no good motive\\n', 'in granting it in North America. The act was also offensive because\\n', 'Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia had, under their charters,\\n', 'large claims in the territory thus annexed to Quebec.\\n', '\\n', 'To enforce these intolerable acts the military arm of the British\\n', 'government was brought into play. The commander-in-chief of the armed\\n', 'forces in America, General Gage, was appointed governor of\\n', 'Massachusetts. Reinforcements were brought to the colonies, for now King\\n', 'George was to give \"the rebels,\" as he called them, a taste of strong\\n', 'medicine. The majesty of his law was to be vindicated by force.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'FROM REFORM TO REVOLUTION IN AMERICA\\n', '\\n', '=The Doctrine of Natural Rights.=--The dissolution of assemblies, the\\n', 'destruction of charters, and the use of troops produced in the colonies\\n', 'a new phase in the struggle. In the early days of the contest with the\\n', 'British ministry, the Americans spoke of their \"rights as Englishmen\"\\n', 'and condemned the acts of Parliament as unlawful, as violating the\\n', 'principles of the English constitution under which they all lived. When\\n', 'they saw that such arguments had no effect on Parliament, they turned\\n', 'for support to their \"natural rights.\" The latter doctrine, in the form\\n', 'in which it was employed by the colonists, was as English as the\\n', 'constitutional argument. John Locke had used it with good effect in\\n', 'defense of the English revolution in the seventeenth century. American\\n', 'leaders, familiar with the writings of Locke, also took up his thesis in\\n', 'the hour of their distress. They openly declared that their rights did\\n', 'not rest after all upon the English constitution or a charter from the\\n', 'crown. \"Old Magna Carta was not the beginning of all things,\" retorted\\n', 'Otis when the constitutional argument failed. \"A time may come when\\n', 'Parliament shall declare every American charter void, but the natural,\\n', 'inherent, and inseparable rights of the colonists as men and as citizens\\n', 'would remain and whatever became of charters can never be abolished\\n', 'until the general conflagration.\" Of the same opinion was the young and\\n', 'impetuous Alexander Hamilton. \"The sacred rights of mankind,\" he\\n', 'exclaimed, \"are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty\\n', 'records. They are written as with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human\\n', 'destiny by the hand of divinity itself, and can never be erased or\\n', 'obscured by mortal power.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Firm as the American leaders were in the statement and defense of their\\n', 'rights, there is every reason for believing that in the beginning they\\n', 'hoped to confine the conflict to the realm of opinion. They constantly\\n', 'avowed that they were loyal to the king when protesting in the strongest\\n', 'language against his policies. Even Otis, regarded by the loyalists as a\\n', 'firebrand, was in fact attempting to avert revolution by winning\\n', 'concessions from England. \"I argue this cause with the greater\\n', 'pleasure,\" he solemnly urged in his speech against the writs of\\n', 'assistance, \"as it is in favor of British liberty ... and as it is in\\n', 'opposition to a kind of power, the exercise of which in former periods\\n', 'cost one king of England his head and another his throne.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Burke Offers the Doctrine of Conciliation.=--The flooding tide of\\n', 'American sentiment was correctly measured by one Englishman at least,\\n', 'Edmund Burke, who quickly saw that attempts to restrain the rise of\\n', 'American democracy were efforts to reverse the processes of nature. He\\n', 'saw how fixed and rooted in the nature of things was the American\\n', 'spirit--how inevitable, how irresistible. He warned his countrymen that\\n', 'there were three ways of handling the delicate situation--and only\\n', 'three. One was to remove the cause of friction by changing the spirit of\\n', 'the colonists--an utter impossibility because that spirit was grounded\\n', 'in the essential circumstances of American life. The second was to\\n', 'prosecute American leaders as criminals; of this he begged his\\n', 'countrymen to beware lest the colonists declare that \"a government\\n', 'against which a claim of liberty is tantamount to high treason is a\\n', 'government to which submission is equivalent to slavery.\" The third and\\n', 'right way to meet the problem, Burke concluded, was to accept the\\n', 'American spirit, repeal the obnoxious measures, and receive the colonies\\n', 'into equal partnership.\\n', '\\n', '=Events Produce the Great Decision.=--The right way, indicated by Burke,\\n', 'was equally impossible to George III and the majority in Parliament. To\\n', 'their narrow minds, American opinion was contemptible and American\\n', 'resistance unlawful, riotous, and treasonable. The correct way, in their\\n', 'view, was to dispatch more troops to crush the \"rebels\"; and that very\\n', 'act took the contest from the realm of opinion. As John Adams said:\\n', '\"Facts are stubborn things.\" Opinions were unseen, but marching soldiers\\n', 'were visible to the veriest street urchin. \"Now,\" said Gouverneur\\n', 'Morris, \"the sheep, simple as they are, cannot be gulled as heretofore.\"\\n', 'It was too late to talk about the excellence of the British\\n', 'constitution.

The\\n', 'cause of Massachusetts became the cause of all the colonies. Opposition\\n', 'to British policy, hitherto local and spasmodic, now took on a national\\n', 'character. To local committees and provincial conventions was added a\\n', 'Continental Congress, appropriately called by Massachusetts on June 17,\\n', '1774, at the instigation of Samuel Adams. The response to the summons\\n', 'was electric. By hurried and irregular methods delegates were elected\\n', 'during the summer, and on September 5 the Congress duly assembled in\\n', \"Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia. Many of the greatest men in America\\n\", 'were there--George Washington and Patrick Henry from Virginia and John\\n', 'and Samuel Adams from Massachusetts. Every shade of opinion was\\n', 'represented. Some were impatient with mild devices; the majority favored\\n', 'moderation.\\n', '\\n', 'The Congress drew up a declaration of American rights and stated in\\n', 'clear and dignified language the grievances of the colonists. It\\n', 'approved the resistance to British measures offered by Massachusetts and\\n', 'promised the united support of all sections. It prepared an address to\\n', 'King George and another to the people of England, disavowing the idea of\\n', 'independence but firmly attacking the policies pursued by the British\\n', 'government.\\n', '\\n', '=The Non-Importation Agreement.=--The Congress was not content, however,\\n', 'with professions of faith and with petitions. It took one revolutionary\\n', 'step. It agreed to stop the importation of British goods into America,\\n', 'and the enforcement of this agreement it placed in the hands of local\\n', '\"committees of safety and inspection,\" to be elected by the qualified\\n', 'voters. The significance of this action is obvious. Congress threw\\n', 'itself athwart British law. It made a rule to bind American citizens and\\n', 'to be carried into effect by American officers. It set up a state within\\n', 'the British state and laid down a test of allegiance to the new order.\\n', 'The colonists, who up to this moment had been wavering, had to choose\\n', 'one authority or the other. They were for the enforcement of the\\n', 'non-importation agreement or they were against it. They either bought\\n', 'English goods or they did not. In the spirit of the toast--\"May Britain\\n', 'be wise and America be free\"--the first Continental Congress adjourned\\n', 'in October, having appointed the tenth of May following for the meeting\\n', 'of a second Congress, should necessity require.\\n', '\\n', '=Lord North\\'s \"Olive Branch.\"=--When the news of the action of the\\n', 'American Congress reached England, Pitt and Burke warmly urged a repeal\\n', 'of the obnoxious laws, but in vain. All they could wring from the prime\\n', 'minister, Lord North, was a set of \"conciliatory resolutions\" proposing\\n', 'to relieve from taxation any colony that would assume its share of\\n', 'imperial defense and make provision for supporting the local officers of\\n', 'the crown. This \"olive branch\" was accompanied by a resolution assuring\\n', 'the king of support at all hazards in suppressing the rebellion and by\\n', 'the restraining act of March 30, 1775, which in effect destroyed the\\n', 'commerce of New England.\\n', '\\n', '=Bloodshed at Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775).=--Meanwhile the\\n', 'British authorities in Massachusetts relaxed none of their efforts in\\n', 'upholding British sovereignty. General Gage, hearing that military\\n', 'stores had been collected at Concord, dispatched a small force to seize\\n', 'them. By this act he precipitated the conflict he had sought to avoid.\\n', 'At Lexington, on the road to Concord, occurred \"the little thing\" that\\n', 'produced \"the great event.\" An unexpected collision beyond the thought\\n', 'or purpose of any man had transferred the contest from the forum to the\\n', 'battle field.\\n', '\\n', '=The Second Continental Congress.=--Though blood had been shed and war\\n', 'was actually at hand, the second Continental Congress, which met at\\n', 'Philadelphia in May, 1775, was not yet convinced that conciliation was\\n', 'beyond human power. It petitioned the king to interpose on behalf of the\\n', 'colonists in order that the empire might avoid the calamities of civil\\n', 'war. On the last day of July, it made a temperate but firm answer to\\n', \"Lord North's offer of conciliation, stating that the proposal was\\n\", 'unsatisfactory because it did not renounce the right to tax or repeal\\n', 'the offensive acts of Parliament.\\n', '\\n', '=Force, the British Answer.=--Just as the representatives of America\\n', 'were about to present the last petition of Congress to the king on\\n', 'August 23, 1775, George III issued a proclamation of rebellion. This\\n', 'announcement declared that the colonists, \"misled by dangerous and\\n', 'ill-designing men,\" were in a state of insurrection; it called on the\\n', 'civil and military powers to bring \"the traitors to justice\"; and it\\n', 'threatened with \"condign punishment the authors, perpetrators, and\\n', 'abettors of such traitorous designs.\" It closed with the usual prayer:\\n', '\"God, save the king.\" Later in the year, Parliament passed a sweeping\\n', 'act destroying all trade and intercourse with America. Congress was\\n', \"silent at last. Force was also America's answer.\\n\", '\\n', '\\n', 'AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE\\n', '\\n', '=Drifting into War.=--Although the Congress had not given up all hope of\\n', 'reconciliation in the spring and summer of 1775, it had firmly resolved\\n', 'to defend American rights by arms if necessary. It transformed the\\n', 'militiamen who had assembled near Boston, after the battle of Lexington,\\n', 'into a Continental army and selected Washington as commander-in-chief.\\n', 'It assumed the powers of a government and prepared to raise money, wage\\n', 'war, and carry on diplomatic relations with foreign countries.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', 'SPIRIT OF 1776]\\n', '\\n', 'Events followed thick and fast. On June 17, the American militia, by\\n', 'the stubborn defense of Bunker Hill, showed that it could make British\\n', 'regulars pay dearly for all they got. On July 3, Washington took command\\n', 'of the army at Cambridge. In January, 1776, after bitter disappointments\\n', 'in drumming up recruits for its army in England, Scotland, and Ireland,\\n', 'the British government concluded a treaty with the Landgrave of\\n', 'Hesse-Cassel in Germany contracting, at a handsome figure, for thousands\\n', 'of soldiers and many pieces of cannon. This was the crowning insult to\\n', 'America. Such was the view of all friends of the colonies on both sides\\n', 'of the water. Such was, long afterward, the judgment of the conservative\\n', 'historian Lecky: \"The conduct of England in hiring German mercenaries to\\n', 'subdue the essentially English population beyond the Atlantic made\\n', 'reconciliation hopeless and independence inevitable.\" The news of this\\n', 'wretched transaction in German soldiers had hardly reached America\\n', 'before there ran all down the coast the thrilling story that Washington\\n', 'had taken Boston, on March 17, 1776, compelling Lord Howe to sail with\\n', 'his entire army for Halifax.\\n', '\\n', '=The Growth of Public Sentiment in Favor of Independence.=--Events were\\n', 'bearing the Americans away from their old position under the British\\n', 'constitution toward a final separation.

In\\n', 'all parts of the country and among all classes, the question of the hour\\n', 'was being debated. \"American independence,\" as the historian Bancroft\\n', 'says, \"was not an act of sudden passion nor the work of one man or one\\n', 'assembly. It had been discussed in every part of the country by farmers\\n', 'and merchants, by mechanics and planters, by the fishermen along the\\n', 'coast and the backwoodsmen of the West; in town meetings and from the\\n', 'pulpit; at social gatherings and around the camp fires; in county\\n', 'conventions and conferences or committees; in colonial congresses and\\n', 'assemblies.\"\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', 'THOMAS PAINE]\\n', '\\n', '=Paine\\'s \"Commonsense.\"=--In the midst of this ferment of American\\n', 'opinion, a bold and eloquent pamphleteer broke in upon the hesitating\\n', 'public with a program for absolute independence, without fears and\\n', 'without apologies.

He condemned monarchy itself as a system\\n', 'which had laid the world \"in blood and ashes.\" Instead of praising the\\n', 'British constitution under which colonists had been claiming their\\n', 'rights, he brushed it aside as ridiculous, protesting that it was \"owing\\n', 'to the constitution of the people, not to the constitution of the\\n', 'government, that the Crown is not as oppressive in England as in\\n', 'Turkey.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Having thus summarily swept away the grounds of allegiance to the old\\n', 'order, Paine proceeded relentlessly to an argument for immediate\\n', 'separation from Great Britain. There was nothing in the sphere of\\n', 'practical interest, he insisted, which should bind the colonies to the\\n', 'mother country. Allegiance to her had been responsible for the many wars\\n', 'in which they had been involved. Reasons of trade were not less weighty\\n', 'in behalf of independence. \"Our corn will fetch its price in any market\\n', 'in Europe and our imported goods must be paid for, buy them where we\\n', 'will.\" As to matters of government, \"it is not in the power of Britain\\n', 'to do this continent justice; the business of it will soon be too\\n', 'weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of\\n', 'convenience by a power so distant from us and so very ignorant of us.\"\\n', '\\n', 'There is accordingly no alternative to independence for America.\\n', '\"Everything that is right or natural pleads for separation. The blood of\\n', \"the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries ''tis time to part.' ...\\n\", 'Arms, the last resort, must decide the contest; the appeal was the\\n', 'choice of the king and the continent hath accepted the challenge.... The\\n', \"sun never shone on a cause of greater worth. 'Tis not the affair of a\\n\", \"city, a county, a province or a kingdom, but of a continent.... 'Tis not\\n\", 'the concern of a day, a year or an age; posterity is involved in the\\n', 'contest and will be more or less affected to the end of time by the\\n', 'proceedings now. Now is the seed-time of Continental union, faith, and\\n', 'honor.... O! ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose not only the\\n', 'tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth.... Let names of Whig and Tory be\\n', 'extinct.

On the tenth of\\n', 'February, 1776, Gadsden, in the provincial convention of South Carolina,\\n', 'advocated a new constitution for the colony and absolute independence\\n', 'for all America. The convention balked at the latter but went half way\\n', 'by abolishing the system of royal administration and establishing a\\n', 'complete plan of self-government. A month later, on April 12, the\\n', 'neighboring state of North Carolina uttered the daring phrase from which\\n', 'others shrank. It empowered its representatives in the Congress to\\n', 'concur with the delegates of the other colonies in declaring\\n', 'independence. Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Virginia quickly\\n', 'responded to the challenge. The convention of the Old Dominion, on May\\n', '15, instructed its delegates at Philadelphia to propose the independence\\n', 'of the United Colonies and to give the assent of Virginia to the act of\\n', 'separation. When the resolution was carried the British flag on the\\n', 'state house was lowered for all time.\\n', '\\n', 'Meanwhile the Continental Congress was alive to the course of events\\n', 'outside. The subject of independence was constantly being raised. \"Are\\n', 'we rebels?\" exclaimed Wyeth of Virginia during a debate in February.\\n', '\"No: we must declare ourselves a free people.\" Others hesitated and\\n', 'spoke of waiting for the arrival of commissioners of conciliation. \"Is\\n', 'not America already independent?\" asked Samuel Adams a few weeks later.\\n', '\"Why not then declare it?\" Still there was uncertainty and delegates\\n', 'avoided the direct word. A few more weeks elapsed. At last, on May 10,\\n', 'Congress declared that the authority of the British crown in America\\n', 'must be suppressed and advised the colonies to set up governments of\\n', 'their own.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', 'THOMAS JEFFERSON READING HIS DRAFT OF THE DECLARATION OF\\n', 'INDEPENDENCE TO THE COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS]\\n', '\\n', '=Independence Declared.=--The way was fully prepared, therefore, when,\\n', 'on June 7, the Virginia delegation in the Congress moved that \"these\\n', 'united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent\\n', 'states.\" A committee was immediately appointed to draft a formal\\n', 'document setting forth the reasons for the act, and on July 2 all the\\n', 'states save New York went on record in favor of severing their political\\n', \"connection with Great Britain. Two days later, July 4, Jefferson's draft\\n\", 'of the Declaration of Independence, changed in some slight particulars,\\n', 'was adopted. The old bell in Independence Hall, as it is now known, rang\\n', 'out the glad tidings; couriers swiftly carried the news to the uttermost\\n', 'hamlet and farm. A new nation announced its will to have a place among\\n', 'the powers of the world.\\n', '\\n', 'To some documents is given immortality. The Declaration of Independence\\n', 'is one of them. American patriotism is forever associated with it; but\\n', 'patriotism alone does not make it immortal. Neither does the vigor of\\n', 'its language or the severity of its indictment give it a secure place in\\n', 'the records of time. The secret of its greatness lies in the simple fact\\n', 'that it is one of the memorable landmarks in the history of a political\\n', 'ideal which for three centuries has been taking form and spreading\\n', 'throughout the earth, challenging kings and potentates, shaking down\\n', 'thrones and aristocracies, breaking the armies of irresponsible power on\\n', 'battle fields as far apart as Marston Moor and Chateau-Thierry. That\\n', 'ideal, now so familiar, then so novel, is summed up in the simple\\n', 'sentence: \"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\\n', 'governed.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Written in a \"decent respect for the opinions of mankind,\" to set forth\\n', 'the causes which impelled the American colonists to separate from\\n', 'Britain, the Declaration contained a long list of \"abuses and\\n', 'usurpations\" which had induced them to throw off the government of King\\n', 'George. That section of the Declaration has passed into \"ancient\"\\n', 'history and is seldom read. It is the part laying down a new basis for\\n', 'government and giving a new dignity to the common man that has become a\\n', 'household phrase in the Old World as in the New.\\n', '\\n', 'In the more enduring passages there are four fundamental ideas which,\\n', 'from the standpoint of the old system of government, were the essence of\\n', 'revolution: (1) all men are created equal and are endowed by their\\n', 'Creator with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the\\n', 'pursuit of happiness; (2) the purpose of government is to secure these\\n', 'rights; (3) governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\\n', 'governed; (4) whenever any form of government becomes destructive of\\n', 'these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and\\n', 'institute new government, laying its foundations on such principles and\\n', 'organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to\\n', 'effect their safety and happiness. Here was the prelude to the historic\\n', 'drama of democracy--a challenge to every form of government and every\\n', 'privilege not founded on popular assent.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GOVERNMENT AND THE NEW ALLEGIANCE\\n', '\\n', '=The Committees of Correspondence.=--As soon as debate had passed into\\n', 'armed resistance, the patriots found it necessary to consolidate their\\n', 'forces by organizing civil government. This was readily effected, for\\n', 'the means were at hand in town meetings, provincial legislatures, and\\n', 'committees of correspondence. The working tools of the Revolution were\\n', 'in fact the committees of correspondence--small, local, unofficial\\n', 'groups of patriots formed to exchange views and create public sentiment.\\n', 'As early as November, 1772, such a committee had been created in Boston\\n', 'under the leadership of Samuel Adams. It held regular meetings, sent\\n', 'emissaries to neighboring towns, and carried on a campaign of education\\n', 'in the doctrines of liberty.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: THE COLONIES OF NORTH AMERICA AT THE TIME OF THE\\n', 'DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE]\\n', '\\n', 'Upon local organizations similar in character to the Boston committee\\n', 'were built county committees and then the larger colonial committees,\\n', 'congresses, and conventions, all unofficial and representing the\\n', 'revolutionary elements. Ordinarily the provincial convention was merely\\n', 'the old legislative assembly freed from all royalist sympathizers and\\n', 'controlled by patriots. Finally, upon these colonial assemblies was\\n', 'built the Continental Congress, the precursor of union under the\\n', 'Articles of Confederation and ultimately under the Constitution of the\\n', 'United States. This was the revolutionary government set up within the\\n', 'British empire in America.\\n', '\\n', '=State Constitutions Framed.=--With the rise of these new assemblies of\\n', 'the people, the old colonial governments broke down. From the royal\\n', 'provinces the governor, the judges, and the high officers fled in haste,\\n', 'and it became necessary to substitute patriot authorities. The appeal to\\n', 'the colonies advising them to adopt a new form of government for\\n', 'themselves, issued by the Congress in May, 1776, was quickly acted upon.\\n', 'Before the expiration of a year, Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\\n', 'Delaware, Maryland, Georgia, and New York had drafted new constitutions\\n', 'as states, not as colonies uncertain of their destinies. Connecticut and\\n', 'Rhode Island, holding that their ancient charters were equal to their\\n', 'needs, merely renounced their allegiance to the king and went on as\\n', 'before so far as the form of government was concerned. South Carolina,\\n', 'which had drafted a temporary plan early in 1776, drew up a new and more\\n', 'complete constitution in 1778. Two years later Massachusetts with much\\n', 'deliberation put into force its fundamental law, which in most of its\\n', 'essential features remains unchanged to-day.\\n', '\\n', 'The new state constitutions in their broad outlines followed colonial\\n', 'models. For the royal governor was substituted a governor or president\\n', 'chosen usually by the legislature; but in two instances, New York and\\n', 'Massachusetts, by popular vote. For the provincial council there was\\n', 'substituted, except in Georgia, a senate; while the lower house, or\\n', 'assembly, was continued virtually without change. The old property\\n', 'restriction on the suffrage, though lowered slightly in some states, was\\n', 'continued in full force to the great discontent of the mechanics thus\\n', 'deprived of the ballot. The special qualifications, laid down in several\\n', 'constitutions, for governors, senators, and representatives, indicated\\n', 'that the revolutionary leaders were not prepared for any radical\\n', 'experiments in democracy. The protests of a few women, like Mrs. John\\n', 'Adams of Massachusetts and Mrs. Henry Corbin of Virginia, against a\\n', 'government which excluded them from political rights were treated as\\n', 'mild curiosities of no significance, although in New Jersey women were\\n', 'allowed to vote for many years on the same terms as men.\\n', '\\n', 'By the new state constitutions the signs and symbols of royal power, of\\n', 'authority derived from any source save \"the people,\" were swept aside\\n', 'and republican governments on an imposing scale presented for the first\\n', 'time to the modern world. Copies of these remarkable documents prepared\\n', 'by plain citizens were translated into French and widely circulated in\\n', 'Europe. There they were destined to serve as a guide and inspiration to\\n', 'a generation of constitution-makers whose mission it was to begin the\\n', 'democratic revolution in the Old World.\\n', '\\n', '=The Articles of Confederation.=--The formation of state constitutions\\n', 'was an easy task for the revolutionary leaders. They had only to build\\n', 'on foundations already laid. The establishment of a national system of\\n', 'government was another matter. There had always been, it must be\\n', 'remembered, a system of central control over the colonies, but Americans\\n', 'had had little experience in its operation. When the supervision of the\\n', 'crown of Great Britain was suddenly broken, the patriot leaders,\\n', 'accustomed merely to provincial statesmanship, were poorly trained for\\n', 'action on a national stage.\\n', '\\n', 'Many forces worked against those who, like Franklin, had a vision of\\n', 'national destiny. There were differences in economic interest--commerce\\n', 'and industry in the North and the planting system of the South. There\\n', 'were contests over the apportionment of taxes and the quotas of troops\\n', 'for common defense. To these practical difficulties were added local\\n', 'pride, the vested rights of state and village politicians in their\\n', 'provincial dignity, and the scarcity of men with a large outlook upon\\n', 'the common enterprise.\\n', '\\n', 'Nevertheless, necessity compelled them to consider some sort of\\n', 'federation. The second Continental Congress had hardly opened its work\\n', 'before the most sagacious leaders began to urge the desirability of a\\n', 'permanent connection. As early as July, 1775, Congress resolved to go\\n', 'into a committee of the whole on the state of the union, and Franklin,\\n', 'undaunted by the fate of his Albany plan of twenty years before, again\\n', 'presented a draft of a constitution. Long and desultory debates followed\\n', 'and it was not until late in 1777 that Congress presented to the states\\n', 'the Articles of Confederation. Provincial jealousies delayed\\n', 'ratification, and it was the spring of 1781, a few months before the\\n', 'surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, when Maryland, the last of the\\n', 'states, approved the Articles. This plan of union, though it was all\\n', 'that could be wrung from the reluctant states, provided for neither a\\n', 'chief executive nor a system of federal courts. It created simply a\\n', 'Congress of delegates in which each state had an equal voice and gave it\\n', 'the right to call upon the state legislatures for the sinews of\\n', 'government--money and soldiers.\\n', '\\n', '=The Application of Tests of Allegiance.=--As the successive steps were\\n', 'taken in the direction of independent government, the patriots devised\\n', 'and applied tests designed to discover who were for and who were against\\n', 'the new nation in the process of making. When the first Continental\\n', 'Congress agreed not to allow the importation of British goods, it\\n', 'provided for the creation of local committees to enforce the rules. Such\\n', 'agencies were duly formed by the choice of men favoring the scheme, all\\n', 'opponents being excluded from the elections. Before these bodies those\\n', 'who persisted in buying British goods were summoned and warned or\\n', 'punished according to circumstances. As soon as the new state\\n', 'constitutions were put into effect, local committees set to work in the\\n', 'same way to ferret out all who were not outspoken in their support of\\n', 'the new order of things.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: MOBBING THE TORIES]\\n', '\\n', 'These patriot agencies, bearing different names in different sections,\\n', 'were sometimes ruthless in their methods. They called upon all men to\\n', 'sign the test of loyalty, frequently known as the \"association test.\"\\n', 'Those who refused were promptly branded as outlaws, while some of the\\n', 'more dangerous were thrown into jail. The prison camp in Connecticut at\\n', 'one time held the former governor of New Jersey and the mayor of New\\n', 'York. Thousands were black-listed and subjected to espionage. The\\n', 'black-list of Pennsylvania contained the names of nearly five hundred\\n', 'persons of prominence who were under suspicion. Loyalists or Tories who\\n', 'were bold enough to speak and write against the Revolution were\\n', 'suppressed and their pamphlets burned. In many places, particularly in\\n', 'the North, the property of the loyalists was confiscated and the\\n', 'proceeds applied to the cause of the Revolution.\\n', '\\n', 'The work of the official agencies for suppression of opposition was\\n', 'sometimes supplemented by mob violence. A few Tories were hanged without\\n', 'trial, and others were tarred and feathered. One was placed upon a cake\\n', 'of ice and held there \"until his loyalty to King George might cool.\"\\n', 'Whole families were driven out of their homes to find their way as best\\n', 'they could within the British lines or into Canada, where the British\\n', 'government gave them lands. Such excesses were deplored by Washington,\\n', 'but they were defended on the ground that in effect a civil war, as well\\n', 'as a war for independence, was being waged.\\n', '\\n', '=The Patriots and Tories.=--Thus, by one process or another, those who\\n', 'were to be citizens of the new republic were separated from those who\\n', 'preferred to be subjects of King George. Just what proportion of the\\n', 'Americans favored independence and what share remained loyal to the\\n', 'British monarchy there is no way of knowing. The question of revolution\\n', 'was not submitted to popular vote, and on the point of numbers we have\\n', 'conflicting evidence. On the patriot side, there is the testimony of a\\n', 'careful and informed observer, John Adams, who asserted that two-thirds\\n', 'of the people were for the American cause and not more than one-third\\n', 'opposed the Revolution at all stages.\\n', '\\n', 'On behalf of the loyalists, or Tories as they were popularly known,\\n', 'extravagant claims were made. Joseph Galloway, who had been a member of\\n', 'the first Continental Congress and had fled to England when he saw its\\n', 'temper, testified before a committee of Parliament in 1779 that not\\n', 'one-fifth of the American people supported the insurrection and that\\n', '\"many more than four-fifths of the people prefer a union with Great\\n', 'Britain upon constitutional principles to independence.\" At the same\\n', 'time General Robertson, who had lived in America twenty-four years,\\n', 'declared that \"more than two-thirds of the people would prefer the\\n', 'king\\'s government to the Congress\\' tyranny.\" In an address to the king\\n', 'in that year a committee of American loyalists asserted that \"the number\\n', \"of Americans in his Majesty's army exceeded the number of troops\\n\", 'enlisted by Congress to oppose them.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Character of the Loyalists.=--When General Howe evacuated Boston,\\n', 'more than a thousand people fled with him. This great company, according\\n', 'to a careful historian, \"formed the aristocracy of the province by\\n', 'virtue of their official rank; of their dignified callings and\\n', 'professions; of their hereditary wealth and of their culture.\" The act\\n', 'of banishment passed by Massachusetts in 1778, listing over 300 Tories,\\n', '\"reads like the social register of the oldest and noblest families of\\n', 'New England,\" more than one out of five being graduates of Harvard\\n', 'College. The same was true of New York and Philadelphia; namely, that\\n', 'the leading loyalists were prominent officials of the old order,\\n', 'clergymen and wealthy merchants. With passion the loyalists fought\\n', 'against the inevitable or with anguish of heart they left as refugees\\n', 'for a life of uncertainty in Canada or the mother country.\\n', '\\n', '=Tories Assail the Patriots.=--The Tories who remained in America joined\\n', 'the British army by the thousands or in other ways aided the royal\\n', 'cause. Those who were skillful with the pen assailed the patriots in\\n', 'editorials, rhymes, satires, and political catechisms. They declared\\n', 'that the members of Congress were \"obscure, pettifogging attorneys,\\n', 'bankrupt shopkeepers, outlawed smugglers, etc.\" The people and their\\n', 'leaders they characterized as \"wretched banditti ... the refuse and\\n', 'dregs of mankind.\" The generals in the army they sneered at as \"men of\\n', 'rank and honor nearly on a par with those of the Congress.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Patriot Writers Arouse the National Spirit.=--Stung by Tory taunts,\\n', 'patriot writers devoted themselves to creating and sustaining a public\\n', 'opinion favorable to the American cause. Moreover, they had to combat\\n', 'the depression that grew out of the misfortunes in the early days of the\\n', 'war. A terrible disaster befell Generals Arnold and Montgomery in the\\n', 'winter of 1775 as they attempted to bring Canada into the revolution--a\\n', 'disaster that cost 5000 men; repeated calamities harassed Washington in\\n', '1776 as he was defeated on Long Island, driven out of New York City, and\\n', 'beaten at Harlem Heights and White Plains. These reverses were almost\\n', 'too great for the stoutest patriots.\\n', '\\n', 'Pamphleteers, preachers, and publicists rose, however, to meet the needs\\n', 'of the hour. John Witherspoon, provost of the College of New Jersey,\\n', 'forsook the classroom for the field of political controversy. The poet,\\n', 'Philip Freneau, flung taunts of cowardice at the Tories and celebrated\\n', 'the spirit of liberty in many a stirring poem. Songs, ballads, plays,\\n', 'and satires flowed from the press in an unending stream. Fast days,\\n', 'battle anniversaries, celebrations of important steps taken by Congress\\n', 'afforded to patriotic clergymen abundant opportunities for sermons.\\n', '\"Does Mr. Wiberd preach against oppression?\" anxiously inquired John\\n', 'Adams in a letter to his wife. The answer was decisive. \"The clergy of\\n', 'every denomination, not excepting the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten\\n', 'every Sabbath. They pray for Boston and Massachusetts. They thank God\\n', 'most explicitly and fervently for our remarkable successes. They pray\\n', 'for the American army.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Thomas Paine never let his pen rest. He had been with the forces of\\n', 'Washington when they retreated from Fort Lee and were harried from New\\n', 'Jersey into Pennsylvania. He knew the effect of such reverses on the\\n', 'army as well as on the public. In December, 1776, he made a second great\\n', 'appeal to his countrymen in his pamphlet, \"The Crisis,\" the first part\\n', 'of which he had written while defeat and gloom were all about him. This\\n', 'tract was a cry for continued support of the Revolution. \"These are the\\n', 'times that try men\\'s souls,\" he opened. \"The summer soldier and the\\n', 'sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his\\n', 'country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men\\n', 'and women.\" Paine laid his lash fiercely on the Tories, branding every\\n', 'one as a coward grounded in \"servile, slavish, self-interested fear.\" He\\n', 'deplored the inadequacy of the militia and called for a real army. He\\n', 'refuted the charge that the retreat through New Jersey was a disaster\\n', 'and he promised victory soon. \"By perseverance and fortitude,\" he\\n', 'concluded, \"we have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and\\n', 'submission the sad choice of a variety of evils--a ravaged country, a\\n', 'depopulated city, habitations without safety and slavery without\\n', 'hope.... Look on this picture and weep over it.\" His ringing call to\\n', 'arms was followed by another and another until the long contest was\\n', 'over.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'MILITARY AFFAIRS\\n', '\\n', '=The Two Phases of the War.=--The war which opened with the battle of\\n', 'Lexington, on April 19, 1775, and closed with the surrender of\\n', 'Cornwallis at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, passed through two distinct\\n', 'phases--the first lasting until the treaty of alliance with France, in\\n', '1778, and the second until the end of the struggle. During the first\\n', 'phase, the war was confined mainly to the North. The outstanding\\n', 'features of the contest were the evacuation of Boston by the British,\\n', 'the expulsion of American forces from New York and their retreat through\\n', 'New Jersey, the battle of Trenton, the seizure of Philadelphia by the\\n', 'British (September, 1777), the invasion of New York by Burgoyne and his\\n', 'capture at Saratoga in October, 1777, and the encampment of American\\n', 'forces at Valley Forge for the terrible winter of 1777-78.\\n', '\\n', 'The final phase of the war, opening with the treaty of alliance with\\n', 'France on February 6, 1778, was confined mainly to the Middle states,\\n', 'the West, and the South. In the first sphere of action the chief events\\n', 'were the withdrawal of the British from Philadelphia, the battle of\\n', 'Monmouth, and the inclosure of the British in New York by deploying\\n', 'American forces from Morristown, New Jersey, up to West Point. In the\\n', 'West, George Rogers Clark, by his famous march into the Illinois\\n', 'country, secured Kaskaskia and Vincennes and laid a firm grip on the\\n', 'country between the Ohio and the Great Lakes. In the South, the second\\n', 'period opened with successes for the British. They captured Savannah,\\n', 'conquered Georgia, and restored the royal governor. In 1780 they seized\\n', 'Charleston, administered a crushing defeat to the American forces under\\n', 'Gates at Camden, and overran South Carolina, though meeting reverses at\\n', \"Cowpens and King's Mountain. Then came the closing scenes. Cornwallis\\n\", 'began the last of his operations. He pursued General Greene far into\\n', 'North Carolina, clashed with him at Guilford Court House, retired to the\\n', 'coast, took charge of British forces engaged in plundering Virginia, and\\n', 'fortified Yorktown, where he was penned up by the French fleet from the\\n', 'sea and the combined French and American forces on land.\\n', '\\n', '=The Geographical Aspects of the War.=--For the British the theater of\\n', 'the war offered many problems. From first to last it extended from\\n', 'Massachusetts to Georgia, a distance of almost a thousand miles. It was\\n', 'nearly three thousand miles from the main base of supplies and, though\\n', 'the British navy kept the channel open, transports were constantly\\n', 'falling prey to daring privateers and fleet American war vessels. The\\n', 'sea, on the other hand, offered an easy means of transportation between\\n', 'points along the coast and gave ready access to the American centers of\\n', 'wealth and population. Of this the British made good use. Though early\\n', 'forced to give up Boston, they seized New York and kept it until the end\\n', 'of the war; they took Philadelphia and retained it until threatened by\\n', 'the approach of the French fleet; and they captured and held both\\n', 'Savannah and Charleston. Wars, however, are seldom won by the conquest\\n', 'of cities.\\n', '\\n', 'Particularly was this true in the case of the Revolution. Only a small\\n', 'portion of the American people lived in towns. Countrymen back from the\\n', 'coast were in no way dependent upon them for a livelihood. They lived on\\n', 'the produce of the soil, not upon the profits of trade. This very fact\\n', 'gave strength to them in the contest. Whenever the British ventured far\\n', 'from the ports of entry, they encountered reverses. Burgoyne was forced\\n', 'to surrender at Saratoga because he was surrounded and cut off from his\\n', 'base of supplies. As soon as the British got away from Charleston, they\\n', 'were harassed and worried by the guerrilla warriors of Marion, Sumter,\\n', 'and Pickens. Cornwallis could technically defeat Greene at Guilford far\\n', 'in the interior; but he could not hold the inland region he had invaded.\\n', 'Sustained by their own labor, possessing the interior to which their\\n', 'armies could readily retreat, supplied mainly from native resources, the\\n', 'Americans could not be hemmed in, penned up, and destroyed at one fell\\n', 'blow.\\n', '\\n', '=The Sea Power.=--The British made good use of their fleet in cutting\\n', 'off American trade, but control of the sea did not seriously affect the\\n', 'United States. As an agricultural country, the ruin of its commerce was\\n', 'not such a vital matter. All the materials for a comfortable though\\n', 'somewhat rude life were right at hand. It made little difference to a\\n', 'nation fighting for existence, if silks, fine linens, and chinaware were\\n', 'cut off. This was an evil to which submission was necessary.\\n', '\\n', 'Nor did the brilliant exploits of John Paul Jones and Captain John Barry\\n', 'materially change the situation. They demonstrated the skill of American\\n', 'seamen and their courage as fighting men. They raised the rates of\\n', 'British marine insurance, but they did not dethrone the mistress of the\\n', 'seas. Less spectacular, and more distinctive, were the deeds of the\\n', 'hundreds of privateers and minor captains who overhauled British supply\\n', 'ships and kept British merchantmen in constant anxiety. Not until the\\n', 'French fleet was thrown into the scale, were the British compelled to\\n', 'reckon seriously with the enemy on the sea and make plans based upon the\\n', 'possibilities of a maritime disaster.\\n', '\\n', '=Commanding Officers.=--On the score of military leadership it is\\n', 'difficult to compare the contending forces in the revolutionary contest.\\n', 'There is no doubt that all the British commanders were men of experience\\n', 'in the art of warfare. Sir William Howe had served in America during the\\n', 'French War and was accounted an excellent officer, a strict\\n', 'disciplinarian, and a gallant gentleman. Nevertheless he loved ease,\\n', 'society, and good living, and his expulsion from Boston, his failure to\\n', 'overwhelm Washington by sallies from his comfortable bases at New York\\n', 'and Philadelphia, destroyed every shred of his military reputation. John\\n', 'Burgoyne, to whom was given the task of penetrating New York from\\n', 'Canada, had likewise seen service in the French War both in America and\\n', 'Europe. He had, however, a touch of the theatrical in his nature and\\n', 'after the collapse of his plans and the surrender of his army in 1777,\\n', 'he devoted his time mainly to light literature. Sir Henry Clinton, who\\n', 'directed the movement which ended in the capture of Charleston in 1780,\\n', 'had \"learned his trade on the continent,\" and was regarded as a man of\\n', 'discretion and understanding in military matters. Lord Cornwallis, whose\\n', 'achievements at Camden and Guilford were blotted out by his surrender at\\n', \"Yorktown, had seen service in the Seven Years' War and had undoubted\\n\", 'talents which he afterward displayed with great credit to himself in\\n', 'India. Though none of them, perhaps, were men of first-rate ability,\\n', 'they all had training and experience to guide them.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: GEORGE WASHINGTON]\\n', '\\n', 'The Americans had a host in Washington himself. He had long been\\n', 'interested in military strategy and had tested his coolness under fire\\n', 'during the first clashes with the French nearly twenty years before. He\\n', 'had no doubts about the justice of his cause, such as plagued some of\\n', 'the British generals. He was a stern but reasonable disciplinarian. He\\n', 'was reserved and patient, little given to exaltation at success or\\n', 'depression at reverses. In the dark hour of the Revolution, \"what held\\n', 'the patriot forces together?\" asks Beveridge in his _Life of John\\n', 'Marshall_. Then he answers: \"George Washington and he alone. Had he\\n', 'died or been seriously disabled, the Revolution would have ended....\\n', 'Washington was the soul of the American cause. Washington was the\\n', 'government. Washington was the Revolution.\" The weakness of Congress in\\n', 'furnishing men and supplies, the indolence of civilians, who lived at\\n', 'ease while the army starved, the intrigues of army officers against him\\n', 'such as the \"Conway cabal,\" the cowardice of Lee at Monmouth, even the\\n', 'treason of Benedict Arnold, while they stirred deep emotions in his\\n', 'breast and aroused him to make passionate pleas to his countrymen, did\\n', 'not shake his iron will or his firm determination to see the war through\\n', \"to the bitter end. The weight of Washington's moral force was\\n\", 'immeasurable.\\n', '\\n', 'Of the generals who served under him, none can really be said to have\\n', 'been experienced military men when the war opened. Benedict Arnold, the\\n', 'unhappy traitor but brave and daring soldier, was a druggist, book\\n', 'seller, and ship owner at New Haven when the news of Lexington called\\n', 'him to battle. Horatio Gates was looked upon as a \"seasoned soldier\"\\n', 'because he had entered the British army as a youth, had been wounded at\\n', \"Braddock's memorable defeat, and had served with credit during the Seven\\n\", \"Years' War; but he was the most conspicuous failure of the Revolution.\\n\", 'The triumph over Burgoyne was the work of other men; and his crushing\\n', 'defeat at Camden put an end to his military pretensions. Nathanael\\n', 'Greene was a Rhode Island farmer and smith without military experience\\n', \"who, when convinced that war was coming, read Caesar's _Commentaries_ and\\n\", 'took up the sword. Francis Marion was a shy and modest planter of South\\n', 'Carolina whose sole passage at arms had been a brief but desperate brush\\n', 'with the Indians ten or twelve years earlier. Daniel Morgan, one of the\\n', \"heroes of Cowpens, had been a teamster with Braddock's army and had seen\\n\", 'some fighting during the French and Indian War, but his military\\n', 'knowledge, from the point of view of a trained British officer, was\\n', 'negligible. John Sullivan was a successful lawyer at Durham, New\\n', 'Hampshire, and a major in the local militia when duty summoned him to\\n', 'lay down his briefs and take up the sword. Anthony Wayne was a\\n', 'Pennsylvania farmer and land surveyor who, on hearing the clash of arms,\\n', 'read a few books on war, raised a regiment, and offered himself for\\n', 'service. Such is the story of the chief American military leaders, and\\n', 'it is typical of them all. Some had seen fighting with the French and\\n', 'Indians, but none of them had seen warfare on a large scale with regular\\n', 'troops commanded according to the strategy evolved in European\\n', 'experience. Courage, native ability, quickness of mind, and knowledge of\\n', 'the country they had in abundance, and in battles such as were fought\\n', 'during the Revolution all those qualities counted heavily in the\\n', 'balance.\\n', '\\n', '=Foreign Officers in American Service.=--To native genius was added\\n', 'military talent from beyond the seas. Baron Steuben, well schooled in\\n', 'the iron regime of Frederick the Great, came over from Prussia, joined\\n', 'Washington at Valley Forge, and day after day drilled and manoeuvered the\\n', 'men, laughing and cursing as he turned raw countrymen into regular\\n', 'soldiers. From France came young Lafayette and the stern De Kalb, from\\n', 'Poland came Pulaski and Kosciusko;--all acquainted with the arts of war\\n', 'as waged in Europe and fitted for leadership as well as teaching.\\n', 'Lafayette came early, in 1776, in a ship of his own, accompanied by\\n', 'several officers of wide experience, and remained loyally throughout the\\n', 'war sharing the hardships of American army life. Pulaski fell at the\\n', 'siege of Savannah and De Kalb at Camden. Kosciusko survived the American\\n', 'war to defend in vain the independence of his native land. To these\\n', 'distinguished foreigners, who freely threw in their lot with American\\n', 'revolutionary fortunes, was due much of that spirit and discipline which\\n', 'fitted raw recruits and temperamental militiamen to cope with a military\\n', 'power of the first rank.\\n', '\\n', '=The Soldiers.=--As far as the British soldiers were concerned their\\n', 'annals are short and simple. The regulars from the standing army who\\n', 'were sent over at the opening of the contest, the recruits drummed up\\n', 'by special efforts at home, and the thousands of Hessians bought\\n', 'outright by King George presented few problems of management to the\\n', 'British officers. These common soldiers were far away from home and\\n', 'enlisted for the war. Nearly all of them were well disciplined and many\\n', 'of them experienced in actual campaigns. The armies of King George\\n', 'fought bravely, as the records of Bunker Hill, Brandywine, and Monmouth\\n', 'demonstrate. Many a man and subordinate officer and, for that matter,\\n', 'some of the high officers expressed a reluctance at fighting against\\n', 'their own kin; but they obeyed orders.\\n', '\\n', 'The Americans, on the other hand, while they fought with grim\\n', 'determination, as men fighting for their homes, were lacking in\\n', 'discipline and in the experience of regular troops. When the war broke\\n', 'in upon them, there were no common preparations for it. There was no\\n', 'continental army; there were only local bands of militiamen, many of\\n', 'them experienced in fighting but few of them \"regulars\" in the military\\n', 'sense. Moreover they were volunteers serving for a short time,\\n', 'unaccustomed to severe discipline, and impatient at the restraints\\n', 'imposed on them by long and arduous campaigns. They were continually\\n', 'leaving the service just at the most critical moments. \"The militia,\"\\n', 'lamented Washington, \"come in, you cannot tell how; go, you cannot tell\\n', 'where; consume your provisions; exhaust your stores; and leave you at\\n', 'last at a critical moment.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Again and again Washington begged Congress to provide for an army of\\n', 'regulars enlisted for the war, thoroughly trained and paid according to\\n', 'some definite plan. At last he was able to overcome, in part at least,\\n', 'the chronic fear of civilians in Congress and to wring from that\\n', 'reluctant body an agreement to grant half pay to all officers and a\\n', 'bonus to all privates who served until the end of the war. Even this\\n', 'scheme, which Washington regarded as far short of justice to the\\n', 'soldiers, did not produce quick results. It was near the close of the\\n', 'conflict before he had an army of well-disciplined veterans capable of\\n', 'meeting British regulars on equal terms.\\n', '\\n', 'Though there were times when militiamen and frontiersmen did valiant and\\n', 'effective work, it is due to historical accuracy to deny the\\n', 'time-honored tradition that a few minutemen overwhelmed more numerous\\n', \"forces of regulars in a seven years' war for independence. They did\\n\", 'nothing of the sort. For the victories of Bennington, Trenton, Saratoga,\\n', 'and Yorktown there were the defeats of Bunker Hill, Long Island, White\\n', 'Plains, Germantown, and Camden. Not once did an army of militiamen\\n', 'overcome an equal number of British regulars in an open trial by battle.\\n', '\"To bring men to be well acquainted with the duties of a soldier,\" wrote\\n', 'Washington, \"requires time.... To expect the same service from raw and\\n', 'undisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers is to expect what never\\n', 'did and perhaps never will happen.\"\\n', '\\n', '=How the War Was Won.=--Then how did the American army win the war? For\\n', 'one thing there were delays and blunders on the part of the British\\n', 'generals who, in 1775 and 1776, dallied in Boston and New York with\\n', 'large bodies of regular troops when they might have been dealing\\n', 'paralyzing blows at the scattered bands that constituted the American\\n', 'army. \"Nothing but the supineness or folly of the enemy could have saved\\n', 'us,\" solemnly averred Washington in 1780. Still it is fair to say that\\n', 'this apparent supineness was not all due to the British generals. The\\n', 'ministers behind them believed that a large part of the colonists were\\n', 'loyal and that compromise would be promoted by inaction rather than by a\\n', 'war vigorously prosecuted. Victory by masterly inactivity was obviously\\n', 'better than conquest, and the slighter the wounds the quicker the\\n', 'healing. Later in the conflict when the seasoned forces of France were\\n', 'thrown into the scale, the Americans themselves had learned many things\\n', 'about the practical conduct of campaigns. All along, the British were\\n', 'embarrassed by the problem of supplies. Their troops could not forage\\n', 'with the skill of militiamen, as they were in unfamiliar territory. The\\n', 'long oversea voyages were uncertain at best and doubly so when the\\n', 'warships of France joined the American privateers in preying on supply\\n', 'boats.\\n', '\\n', 'The British were in fact battered and worn down by a guerrilla war and\\n', 'outdone on two important occasions by superior forces--at Saratoga and\\n', 'Yorktown. Stern facts convinced them finally that an immense army, which\\n', 'could be raised only by a supreme effort, would be necessary to subdue\\n', 'the colonies if that hazardous enterprise could be accomplished at all.\\n', 'They learned also that America would then be alienated, fretful, and the\\n', 'scene of endless uprisings calling for an army of occupation. That was a\\n', 'price which staggered even Lord North and George III. Moreover, there\\n', 'were forces of opposition at home with which they had to reckon.\\n', '\\n', '=Women and the War.=--At no time were the women of America indifferent\\n', 'to the struggle for independence. When it was confined to the realm of\\n', 'opinion they did their part in creating public sentiment. Mrs. Elizabeth\\n', 'Timothee, for example, founded in Charleston, in 1773, a newspaper to\\n', 'espouse the cause of the province. Far to the north the sister of James\\n', 'Otis, Mrs. Mercy Warren, early begged her countrymen to rest their case\\n', 'upon their natural rights, and in influential circles she urged the\\n', 'leaders to stand fast by their principles. While John Adams was tossing\\n', 'about with uncertainty at the Continental Congress, his wife was writing\\n', 'letters to him declaring her faith in \"independency.\"\\n', '\\n', 'When the war came down upon the country, women helped in every field. In\\n', 'sustaining public sentiment they were active. Mrs. Warren with a\\n', 'tireless pen combatted loyalist propaganda in many a drama and satire.\\n', 'Almost every revolutionary leader had a wife or daughter who rendered\\n', 'service in the \"second line of defense.\" Mrs. Washington managed the\\n', 'plantation while the General was at the front and went north to face the\\n', 'rigors of the awful winter at Valley Forge--an inspiration to her\\n', 'husband and his men. The daughter of Benjamin Franklin, Mrs. Sarah\\n', 'Bache, while her father was pleading the American cause in France, set\\n', 'the women of Pennsylvania to work sewing and collecting supplies. Even\\n', 'near the firing line women were to be found, aiding the wounded, hauling\\n', 'powder to the front, and carrying dispatches at the peril of their\\n', 'lives.\\n', '\\n', 'In the economic sphere, the work of women was invaluable. They harvested\\n', 'crops without enjoying the picturesque title of \"farmerettes\" and they\\n', 'canned and preserved for the wounded and the prisoners of war. Of their\\n', 'labor in spinning and weaving it is recorded: \"Immediately on being cut\\n', 'off from the use of English manufactures, the women engaged within their\\n', 'own families in manufacturing various kinds of cloth for domestic use.\\n', 'They thus kept their households decently clad and the surplus of their\\n', 'labors they sold to such as chose to buy rather than make for\\n', 'themselves. In this way the female part of families by their industry\\n', 'and strict economy frequently supported the whole domestic circle,\\n', 'evincing the strength of their attachment and the value of their\\n', 'service.\"\\n', '\\n', 'For their war work, women were commended by high authorities on more\\n', 'than one occasion. They were given medals and public testimonials even\\n', 'as in our own day. Washington thanked them for their labors and paid\\n', 'tribute to them for the inspiration and material aid which they had\\n', 'given to the cause of independence.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE FINANCES OF THE REVOLUTION\\n', '\\n', 'When the Revolution opened, there were thirteen little treasuries in\\n', 'America but no common treasury, and from first to last the Congress was\\n', 'in the position of a beggar rather than a sovereign. Having no authority\\n', 'to lay and collect taxes directly and knowing the hatred of the\\n', 'provincials for taxation, it resorted mainly to loans and paper money to\\n', 'finance the war. \"Do you think,\" boldly inquired one of the delegates,\\n', '\"that I will consent to load my constituents with taxes when we can send\\n', 'to the printer and get a wagon load of money, one quire of which will\\n', 'pay for the whole?\"\\n', '\\n', '=Paper Money and Loans.=--Acting on this curious but appealing political\\n', 'economy, Congress issued in June, 1776, two million dollars in bills of\\n', 'credit to be redeemed by the states on the basis of their respective\\n', 'populations. Other issues followed in quick succession. In all about\\n', '$241,000,000 of continental paper was printed, to which the several\\n', 'states added nearly $210,000,000 of their own notes. Then came\\n', 'interest-bearing bonds in ever increasing quantities. Several millions\\n', 'were also borrowed from France and small sums from Holland and Spain. In\\n', 'desperation a national lottery was held, producing meager results. The\\n', 'property of Tories was confiscated and sold, bringing in about\\n', '$16,000,000. Begging letters were sent to the states asking them to\\n', 'raise revenues for the continental treasury, but the states, burdened\\n', 'with their own affairs, gave little heed.\\n', '\\n', '=Inflation and Depreciation.=--As paper money flowed from the press, it\\n', 'rapidly declined in purchasing power until in 1779 a dollar was worth\\n', 'only two or three cents in gold or silver. Attempts were made by\\n', 'Congress and the states to compel people to accept the notes at face\\n', 'value; but these were like attempts to make water flow uphill.\\n', 'Speculators collected at once to fatten on the calamities of the\\n', 'republic. Fortunes were made and lost gambling on the prices of public\\n', 'securities while the patriot army, half clothed, was freezing at Valley\\n', 'Forge. \"Speculation, peculation, engrossing, forestalling,\" exclaimed\\n', 'Washington, \"afford too many melancholy proofs of the decay of public\\n', 'virtue. Nothing, I am convinced, but the depreciation of our currency\\n', '... aided by stock jobbing and party dissensions has fed the hopes of\\n', 'the enemy.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Patriot Financiers.=--To the efforts of Congress in financing the\\n', 'war were added the labors of private citizens. Hayn Solomon, a merchant\\n', 'of Philadelphia, supplied members of Congress, including Madison,\\n', 'Jefferson, and Monroe, and army officers, like Lee and Steuben, with\\n', 'money for their daily needs. All together he contributed the huge sum of\\n', 'half a million dollars to the American cause and died broken in purse,\\n', 'if not in spirit, a British prisoner of war. Another Philadelphia\\n', 'merchant, Robert Morris, won for himself the name of the \"patriot\\n', 'financier\" because he labored night and day to find the money to meet\\n', 'the bills which poured in upon the bankrupt government. When his own\\n', 'funds were exhausted, he borrowed from his friends. Experienced in the\\n', 'handling of merchandise, he created agencies at important points to\\n', 'distribute supplies to the troops, thus displaying administrative as\\n', 'well as financial talents.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: ROBERT MORRIS]\\n', '\\n', 'Women organized \"drives\" for money, contributed their plate and their\\n', 'jewels, and collected from door to door. Farmers took worthless paper in\\n', 'return for their produce, and soldiers saw many a pay day pass without\\n', 'yielding them a penny. Thus by the labors and sacrifices of citizens,\\n', 'the issuance of paper money, lotteries, the floating of loans,\\n', 'borrowings in Europe, and the impressment of supplies, the Congress\\n', 'staggered through the Revolution like a pauper who knows not how his\\n', 'next meal is to be secured but is continuously relieved at a crisis by a\\n', 'kindly fate.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE DIPLOMACY OF THE REVOLUTION\\n', '\\n', 'When the full measure of honor is given to the soldiers and sailors and\\n', 'their commanding officers, the civilians who managed finances and\\n', 'supplies, the writers who sustained the American spirit, and the women\\n', 'who did well their part, there yet remains the duty of recognizing the\\n', 'achievements of diplomacy. The importance of this field of activity was\\n', 'keenly appreciated by the leaders in the Continental Congress. They were\\n', 'fairly well versed in European history. They knew of the balance of\\n', 'power and the sympathies, interests, and prejudices of nations and their\\n', 'rulers. All this information they turned to good account, in opening\\n', 'relations with continental countries and seeking money, supplies, and\\n', 'even military assistance. For the transaction of this delicate business,\\n', 'they created a secret committee on foreign correspondence as early as\\n', '1775 and prepared to send agents abroad.\\n', '\\n', '=American Agents Sent Abroad.=--Having heard that France was inclining a\\n', 'friendly ear to the American cause, the Congress, in March, 1776, sent a\\n', 'commissioner to Paris, Silas Deane of Connecticut, often styled the\\n', '\"first American diplomat.\" Later in the year a form of treaty to be\\n', 'presented to foreign powers was drawn up, and Franklin, Arthur Lee, and\\n', 'Deane were selected as American representatives at the court of \"His\\n', 'Most Christian Majesty the King of France.\" John Jay of New York was\\n', 'chosen minister to Spain in 1779; John Adams was sent to Holland the\\n', 'same year; and other agents were dispatched to Florence, Vienna, and\\n', 'Berlin. The representative selected for St. Petersburg spent two\\n', 'fruitless years there, \"ignored by the court, living in obscurity and\\n', 'experiencing nothing but humiliation and failure.\" Frederick the Great,\\n', 'king of Prussia, expressed a desire to find in America a market for\\n', \"Silesian linens and woolens, but, fearing England's command of the sea,\\n\", 'he refused to give direct aid to the Revolutionary cause.\\n', '\\n', '=Early French Interest.=--The great diplomatic triumph of the Revolution\\n', 'was won at Paris, and Benjamin Franklin was the hero of the occasion,\\n', 'although many circumstances prepared the way for his success. Louis\\n', \"XVI's foreign minister, Count de Vergennes, before the arrival of any\\n\", 'American representative, had brought to the attention of the king the\\n', 'opportunity offered by the outbreak of the war between England and her\\n', 'colonies. He showed him how France could redress her grievances and\\n', '\"reduce the power and greatness of England\"--the empire that in 1763 had\\n', 'forced upon her a humiliating peace \"at the price of our possessions,\\n', 'of our commerce, and our credit in the Indies, at the price of Canada,\\n', 'Louisiana, Isle Royale, Acadia, and Senegal.\" Equally successful in\\n', \"gaining the king's interest was a curious French adventurer,\\n\", 'Beaumarchais, a man of wealth, a lover of music, and the author of two\\n', 'popular plays, \"Figaro\" and \"The Barber of Seville.\" These two men had\\n', 'already urged upon the king secret aid for America before Deane appeared\\n', 'on the scene. Shortly after his arrival they made confidential\\n', 'arrangements to furnish money, clothing, powder, and other supplies to\\n', 'the struggling colonies, although official requests for them were\\n', 'officially refused by the French government.\\n', '\\n', '=Franklin at Paris.=--When Franklin reached Paris, he was received only\\n', \"in private by the king's minister, Vergennes. The French people,\\n\", 'however, made manifest their affection for the \"plain republican\" in\\n', '\"his full dress suit of spotted Manchester velvet.\" He was known among\\n', 'men of letters as an author, a scientist, and a philosopher of\\n', 'extraordinary ability. His \"Poor Richard\" had thrice been translated\\n', 'into French and was scattered in numerous editions throughout the\\n', 'kingdom. People of all ranks--ministers, ladies at court, philosophers,\\n', 'peasants, and stable boys--knew of Franklin and wished him success in\\n', 'his mission. The queen, Marie Antoinette, fated to lose her head in a\\n', 'revolution soon to follow, played with fire by encouraging \"our dear\\n', 'republican.\"\\n', '\\n', 'For the king of France, however, this was more serious business. England\\n', 'resented the presence of this \"traitor\" in Paris, and Louis had to be\\n', 'cautious about plunging into another war that might also end\\n', \"disastrously. Moreover, the early period of Franklin's sojourn in Paris\\n\", \"was a dark hour for the American Revolution. Washington's brilliant\\n\", 'exploit at Trenton on Christmas night, 1776, and the battle with\\n', 'Cornwallis at Princeton had been followed by the disaster at Brandywine,\\n', 'the loss of Philadelphia, the defeat at Germantown, and the retirement\\n', 'to Valley Forge for the winter of 1777-78. New York City and\\n', 'Philadelphia--two strategic ports--were in British hands; the Hudson\\n', 'and Delaware rivers were blocked; and General Burgoyne with his British\\n', 'troops was on his way down through the heart of northern New York,\\n', 'cutting New England off from the rest of the colonies. No wonder the\\n', 'king was cautious. Then the unexpected happened. Burgoyne, hemmed in\\n', 'from all sides by the American forces, his flanks harried, his foraging\\n', 'parties beaten back, his supplies cut off, surrendered on October 17,\\n', '1777, to General Gates, who had superseded General Schuyler in time to\\n', 'receive the honor.\\n', '\\n', '=Treaties of Alliance and Commerce (1778).=--News of this victory,\\n', 'placed by historians among the fifteen decisive battles of the world,\\n', 'reached Franklin one night early in December while he and some friends\\n', 'sat gloomily at dinner. Beaumarchais, who was with him, grasped at once\\n', 'the meaning of the situation and set off to the court at Versailles with\\n', 'such haste that he upset his coach and dislocated his arm. The king and\\n', 'his ministers were at last convinced that the hour had come to aid the\\n', 'Revolution. Treaties of commerce and alliance were drawn up and signed\\n', 'in February, 1778. The independence of the United States was recognized\\n', 'by France and an alliance was formed to guarantee that independence.\\n', 'Combined military action was agreed upon and Louis then formally\\n', 'declared war on England. Men who had, a few short years before, fought\\n', 'one another in the wilderness of Pennsylvania or on the Plains of\\n', 'Abraham, were now ranged side by side in a war on the Empire that Pitt\\n', 'had erected and that George III was pulling down.\\n', '\\n', '=Spain and Holland Involved.=--Within a few months, Spain, remembering\\n', 'the steady decline of her sea power since the days of the Armada and\\n', 'hoping to drive the British out of Gibraltar, once more joined the\\n', 'concert of nations against England. Holland, a member of a league of\\n', 'armed neutrals formed in protest against British searches on the high\\n', 'seas, sent her fleet to unite with the forces of Spain, France, and\\n', 'America to prey upon British commerce. To all this trouble for England\\n', 'was added the danger of a possible revolt in Ireland, where the spirit\\n', 'of independence was flaming up.\\n', '\\n', '=The British Offer Terms to America.=--Seeing the colonists about to be\\n', 'joined by France in a common war on the English empire, Lord North\\n', 'proposed, in February, 1778, a renewal of negotiations. By solemn\\n', 'enactment, Parliament declared its intention not to exercise the right\\n', 'of imposing taxes within the colonies; at the same time it authorized\\n', 'the opening of negotiations through commissioners to be sent to America.\\n', 'A truce was to be established, pardons granted, objectionable laws\\n', 'suspended, and the old imperial constitution, as it stood before the\\n', 'opening of hostilities, restored to full vigor. It was too late. Events\\n', 'had taken the affairs of America out of the hands of British\\n', 'commissioners and diplomats.\\n', '\\n', '=Effects of French Aid.=--The French alliance brought ships of war,\\n', 'large sums of gold and silver, loads of supplies, and a considerable\\n', 'body of trained soldiers to the aid of the Americans. Timely as was this\\n', 'help, it meant no sudden change in the fortunes of war. The British\\n', 'evacuated Philadelphia in the summer following the alliance, and\\n', \"Washington's troops were encouraged to come out of Valley Forge. They\\n\", 'inflicted a heavy blow on the British at Monmouth, but the treasonable\\n', 'conduct of General Charles Lee prevented a triumph. The recovery of\\n', 'Philadelphia was offset by the treason of Benedict Arnold, the loss of\\n', 'Savannah and Charleston (1780), and the defeat of Gates at Camden.\\n', '\\n', 'The full effect of the French alliance was not felt until 1781, when\\n', 'Cornwallis went into Virginia and settled at Yorktown. Accompanied by\\n', 'French troops Washington swept rapidly southward and penned the British\\n', 'to the shore while a powerful French fleet shut off their escape by sea.\\n', 'It was this movement, which certainly could not have been executed\\n', 'without French aid, that put an end to all chance of restoring British\\n', 'dominion in America. It was the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown that\\n', 'caused Lord North to pace the floor and cry out: \"It is all over! It is\\n', 'all over!\" What might have been done without the French alliance lies\\n', 'hidden from mankind. What was accomplished with the help of French\\n', 'soldiers, sailors, officers, money, and supplies, is known to all the\\n', 'earth. \"All the world agree,\" exultantly wrote Franklin from Paris to\\n', 'General Washington, \"that no expedition was ever better planned or\\n', 'better executed. It brightens the glory that must accompany your name to\\n', 'the latest posterity.\" Diplomacy as well as martial valor had its\\n', 'reward.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'PEACE AT LAST\\n', '\\n', '=British Opposition to the War.=--In measuring the forces that led to\\n', 'the final discomfiture of King George and Lord North, it is necessary to\\n', 'remember that from the beginning to the end the British ministry at home\\n', 'faced a powerful, informed, and relentless opposition. There were\\n', 'vigorous protests, first against the obnoxious acts which precipitated\\n', 'the unhappy quarrel, then against the way in which the war was waged,\\n', 'and finally against the futile struggle to retain a hold upon the\\n', 'American dominions. Among the members of Parliament who thundered\\n', 'against the government were the first statesmen and orators of the land.\\n', 'William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, though he deplored the idea of American\\n', 'independence, denounced the government as the aggressor and rejoiced in\\n', 'American resistance. Edmund Burke leveled his heavy batteries against\\n', 'every measure of coercion and at last strove for a peace which, while\\n', 'giving independence to America, would work for reconciliation rather\\n', 'than estrangement. Charles James Fox gave the colonies his generous\\n', 'sympathy and warmly championed their rights. Outside of the circle of\\n', 'statesmen there were stout friends of the American cause like David\\n', 'Hume, the philosopher and historian, and Catherine Macaulay, an author\\n', 'of wide fame and a republican bold enough to encourage Washington in\\n', 'seeing it through.\\n', '\\n', 'Against this powerful opposition, the government enlisted a whole army\\n', 'of scribes and journalists to pour out criticism on the Americans and\\n', 'their friends. Dr. Samuel Johnson, whom it employed in this business,\\n', 'was so savage that even the ministers had to tone down his pamphlets\\n', 'before printing them. Far more weighty was Edward Gibbon, who was in\\n', 'time to win fame as the historian of the _Decline and Fall of the Roman\\n', 'Empire_. He had at first opposed the government; but, on being given a\\n', 'lucrative post, he used his sharp pen in its support, causing his\\n', 'friends to ridicule him in these lines:\\n', '\\n', '    \"King George, in a fright\\n', '     Lest Gibbon should write\\n', \"       The story of England's disgrace,\\n\", '     Thought no way so sure\\n', '     His pen to secure\\n', '       As to give the historian a place.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Lord North Yields.=--As time wore on, events bore heavily on the side\\n', \"of the opponents of the government's measures. They had predicted that\\n\", 'conquest was impossible, and they had urged the advantages of a peace\\n', 'which would in some measure restore the affections of the Americans.\\n', \"Every day's news confirmed their predictions and lent support to their\\n\", 'arguments. Moreover, the war, which sprang out of an effort to relieve\\n', 'English burdens, made those burdens heavier than ever. Military expenses\\n', 'were daily increasing. Trade with the colonies, the greatest single\\n', 'outlet for British goods and capital, was paralyzed. The heavy debts due\\n', 'British merchants in America were not only unpaid but postponed into an\\n', 'indefinite future. Ireland was on the verge of revolution. The French\\n', 'had a dangerous fleet on the high seas. In vain did the king assert in\\n', 'December, 1781, that no difficulties would ever make him consent to a\\n', 'peace that meant American independence. Parliament knew better, and on\\n', 'February 27, 1782, in the House of Commons was carried an address to the\\n', 'throne against continuing the war. Burke, Fox, the younger Pitt, Barre,\\n', 'and other friends of the colonies voted in the affirmative. Lord North\\n', 'gave notice then that his ministry was at an end. The king moaned:\\n', '\"Necessity made me yield.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In April, 1782, Franklin received word from the English government that\\n', 'it was prepared to enter into negotiations leading to a settlement. This\\n', 'was embarrassing. In the treaty of alliance with France, the United\\n', 'States had promised that peace should be a joint affair agreed to by\\n', 'both nations in open conference. Finding France, however, opposed to\\n', 'some of their claims respecting boundaries and fisheries, the American\\n', 'commissioners conferred with the British agents at Paris without\\n', 'consulting the French minister. They actually signed a preliminary peace\\n', 'draft before they informed him of their operations. When Vergennes\\n', 'reproached him, Franklin replied that they \"had been guilty of\\n', 'neglecting _bienseance_ [good manners] but hoped that the great work\\n', 'would not be ruined by a single indiscretion.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Terms of Peace (1783).=--The general settlement at Paris in 1783\\n', 'was a triumph for America. England recognized the independence of the\\n', 'United States, naming each state specifically, and agreed to boundaries\\n', 'extending from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and from the Great Lakes\\n', 'to the Floridas. England held Canada, Newfoundland, and the West Indies\\n', 'intact, made gains in India, and maintained her supremacy on the seas.\\n', 'Spain won Florida and Minorca but not the coveted Gibraltar. France\\n', 'gained nothing important save the satisfaction of seeing England humbled\\n', 'and the colonies independent.\\n', '\\n', 'The generous terms secured by the American commission at Paris called\\n', 'forth surprise and gratitude in the United States and smoothed the way\\n', 'for a renewal of commercial relations with the mother country. At the\\n', 'same time they gave genuine anxiety to European diplomats. \"This federal\\n', 'republic is born a pigmy,\" wrote the Spanish ambassador to his royal\\n', 'master. \"A day will come when it will be a giant; even a colossus\\n', 'formidable to these countries. Liberty of conscience and the facility\\n', 'for establishing a new population on immense lands, as well as the\\n', 'advantages of the new government, will draw thither farmers and artisans\\n', 'from all the nations.

Until 1763 the\\n', 'American colonists lived fairly happily under British dominion. There\\n', 'were collisions from time to time, of course. Royal governors clashed\\n', 'with stiff-necked colonial legislatures. There were protests against the\\n', \"exercise of the king's veto power in specific cases. Nevertheless, on\\n\", 'the whole, the relations between America and the mother country were\\n', 'more amicable in 1763 than at any period under the Stuart regime which\\n', 'closed in 1688.\\n', '\\n', 'The crash, when it came, was not deliberately willed by any one. It was\\n', 'the product of a number of forces that happened to converge about 1763.\\n', 'Three years before, there had come to the throne George III, a young,\\n', 'proud, inexperienced, and stubborn king. For nearly fifty years his\\n', 'predecessors, Germans as they were in language and interest, had allowed\\n', 'things to drift in England and America. George III decided that he would\\n', 'be king in fact as well as in name. About the same time England brought\\n', 'to a close the long and costly French and Indian War and was staggering\\n', 'under a heavy burden of debt and taxes. The war had been fought partly\\n', 'in defense of the American colonies and nothing seemed more reasonable\\n', 'to English statesmen than the idea that the colonies should bear part of\\n', 'the cost of their own defense. At this juncture there came into\\n', 'prominence, in royal councils, two men bent on taxing America and\\n', 'controlling her trade, Grenville and Townshend. The king was willing,\\n', 'the English taxpayers were thankful for any promise of relief, and\\n', 'statesmen were found to undertake the experiment. England therefore set\\n', 'out upon a new course. She imposed taxes upon the colonists, regulated\\n', 'their trade and set royal officers upon them to enforce the law. This\\n', 'action evoked protests from the colonists. They held a Stamp Act\\n', 'Congress to declare their rights and petition for a redress of\\n', 'grievances. Some of the more restless spirits rioted in the streets,\\n', \"sacked the houses of the king's officers, and tore up the stamped paper.\\n\", '\\n', 'Frightened by uprising, the English government drew back and repealed\\n', 'the Stamp Act. Then it veered again and renewed its policy of\\n', 'interference. Interference again called forth American protests.\\n', 'Protests aroused sharper retaliation. More British regulars were sent\\n', 'over to keep order. More irritating laws were passed by Parliament.\\n', 'Rioting again appeared: tea was dumped in the harbor of Boston and\\n', 'seized in the harbor of Charleston. The British answer was more force.\\n', 'The response of the colonists was a Continental Congress for defense. An\\n', 'unexpected and unintended clash of arms at Lexington and Concord in the\\n', 'spring of 1775 brought forth from the king of England a proclamation:\\n', '\"The Americans are rebels!\"\\n', '\\n', 'The die was cast.

The\\n', 'majority of the patriots whose labors and sacrifices had made this\\n', 'possible naturally looked upon their work and pronounced it good. Those\\n', 'Americans, however, who peered beneath the surface of things, saw that\\n', 'the Declaration of Independence, even if splendidly phrased, and paper\\n', 'constitutions, drawn by finest enthusiasm \"uninstructed by experience,\"\\n', 'could not alone make the republic great and prosperous or even free. All\\n', 'around them they saw chaos in finance and in industry and perils for the\\n', 'immediate future.\\n', '\\n', '=The Weakness of the Articles of Confederation.=--The government under\\n', 'the Articles of Confederation had neither the strength nor the resources\\n', 'necessary to cope with the problems of reconstruction left by the war.\\n', 'The sole organ of government was a Congress composed of from two to\\n', 'seven members from each state chosen as the legislature might direct and\\n', 'paid by the state. In determining all questions, each state had one\\n', 'vote--Delaware thus enjoying the same weight as Virginia. There was no\\n', 'president to enforce the laws. Congress was given power to select a\\n', 'committee of thirteen--one from each state--to act as an executive body\\n', 'when it was not in session; but this device, on being tried out, proved\\n', 'a failure. There was no system of national courts to which citizens and\\n', 'states could appeal for the protection of their rights or through which\\n', 'they could compel obedience to law. The two great powers of government,\\n', 'military and financial, were withheld. Congress, it is true, could\\n', 'authorize expenditures but had to rely upon the states for the payment\\n', 'of contributions to meet its bills. It could also order the\\n', 'establishment of an army, but it could only request the states to supply\\n', 'their respective quotas of soldiers. It could not lay taxes nor bring\\n', 'any pressure to bear upon a single citizen in the whole country. It\\n', 'could act only through the medium of the state governments.\\n', '\\n', '=Financial and Commercial Disorders.=--In the field of public finance,\\n', 'the disorders were pronounced. The huge debt incurred during the war was\\n', 'still outstanding. Congress was unable to pay either the interest or the\\n', 'principal. Public creditors were in despair, as the market value of\\n', 'their bonds sank to twenty-five or even ten cents on the dollar. The\\n', 'current bills of Congress were unpaid. As some one complained, there was\\n', 'not enough money in the treasury to buy pen and ink with which to record\\n', 'the transactions of the shadow legislature. The currency was in utter\\n', 'chaos. Millions of dollars in notes issued by Congress had become mere\\n', 'trash worth a cent or two on the dollar. There was no other expression\\n', 'of contempt so forceful as the popular saying: \"not worth a\\n', 'Continental.\" To make matters worse, several of the states were pouring\\n', 'new streams of paper money from the press. Almost the only good money in\\n', 'circulation consisted of English, French, and Spanish coins, and the\\n', 'public was even defrauded by them because money changers were busy\\n', 'clipping and filing away the metal. Foreign commerce was unsettled. The\\n', 'entire British system of trade discrimination was turned against the\\n', 'Americans, and Congress, having no power to regulate foreign commerce,\\n', 'was unable to retaliate or to negotiate treaties which it could enforce.\\n', 'Domestic commerce was impeded by the jealousies of the states, which\\n', 'erected tariff barriers against their neighbors. The condition of the\\n', 'currency made the exchange of money and goods extremely difficult, and,\\n', 'as if to increase the confusion, backward states enacted laws hindering\\n', 'the prompt collection of debts within their borders--an evil which\\n', 'nothing but a national system of courts could cure.\\n', '\\n', '=Congress in Disrepute.=--With treaties set at naught by the states, the\\n', 'laws unenforced, the treasury empty, and the public credit gone, the\\n', 'Congress of the United States fell into utter disrepute. It called upon\\n', 'the states to pay their quotas of money into the treasury, only to be\\n', 'treated with contempt. Even its own members looked upon it as a solemn\\n', 'futility. Some of the ablest men refused to accept election to it, and\\n', 'many who did take the doubtful honor failed to attend the sessions.\\n', 'Again and again it was impossible to secure a quorum for the transaction\\n', 'of business.\\n', '\\n', '=Troubles of the State Governments.=--The state governments, free to\\n', 'pursue their own course with no interference from without, had almost as\\n', 'many difficulties as the Congress. They too were loaded with\\n', 'revolutionary debts calling for heavy taxes upon an already restive\\n', 'population. Oppressed by their financial burdens and discouraged by the\\n', 'fall in prices which followed the return of peace, the farmers of\\n', 'several states joined in a concerted effort and compelled their\\n', 'legislatures to issue large sums of paper money. The currency fell in\\n', 'value, but nevertheless it was forced on unwilling creditors to square\\n', 'old accounts.\\n', '\\n', 'In every part of the country legislative action fluctuated violently.\\n', 'Laws were made one year only to be repealed the next and reenacted the\\n', 'third year. Lands were sold by one legislature and the sales were\\n', 'canceled by its successor. Uncertainty and distrust were the natural\\n', 'consequences. Men of substance longed for some power that would forbid\\n', 'states to issue bills of credit, to make paper money legal tender in\\n', 'payment of debts, or to impair the obligation of contracts. Men heavily\\n', 'in debt, on the other hand, urged even more drastic action against\\n', 'creditors.\\n', '\\n', 'So great did the discontent of the farmers in New Hampshire become in\\n', '1786 that a mob surrounded the legislature, demanding a repeal of the\\n', 'taxes and the issuance of paper money. It was with difficulty that an\\n', 'armed rebellion was avoided. In Massachusetts the malcontents, under the\\n', 'leadership of Daniel Shays, a captain in the Revolutionary army,\\n', 'organized that same year open resistance to the government of the state.\\n', 'Shays and his followers protested against the conduct of creditors in\\n', 'foreclosing mortgages upon the debt-burdened farmers, against the\\n', 'lawyers for increasing the costs of legal proceedings, against the\\n', 'senate of the state the members of which were apportioned among the\\n', 'towns on the basis of the amount of taxes paid, against heavy taxes, and\\n', 'against the refusal of the legislature to issue paper money. They seized\\n', 'the towns of Worcester and Springfield and broke up the courts of\\n', 'justice. All through the western part of the state the revolt spread,\\n', 'sending a shock of alarm to every center and section of the young\\n', 'republic. Only by the most vigorous action was Governor Bowdoin able to\\n', 'quell the uprising; and when that task was accomplished, the state\\n', 'government did not dare to execute any of the prisoners because they had\\n', 'so many sympathizers. Moreover, Bowdoin and several members of the\\n', 'legislature who had been most zealous in their attacks on the insurgents\\n', 'were defeated at the ensuing election. The need of national assistance\\n', 'for state governments in times of domestic violence was everywhere\\n', 'emphasized by men who were opposed to revolutionary acts.\\n', '\\n', '=Alarm over Dangers to the Republic.=--Leading American citizens,\\n', 'watching the drift of affairs, were slowly driven to the conclusion that\\n', 'the new ship of state so proudly launched a few years before was\\n', 'careening into anarchy. \"The facts of our peace and independence,\" wrote\\n', 'a friend of Washington, \"do not at present wear so promising an\\n', 'appearance as I had fondly painted in my mind. The prejudices,\\n', 'jealousies, and turbulence of the people at times almost stagger my\\n', 'confidence in our political establishments; and almost occasion me to\\n', 'think that they will show themselves unworthy of the noble prize for\\n', 'which we have contended.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Washington himself was profoundly discouraged. On hearing of Shays's\\n\", 'rebellion, he exclaimed: \"What, gracious God, is man that there should\\n', 'be such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his conduct! It is but the\\n', 'other day that we were shedding our blood to obtain the constitutions\\n', 'under which we now live--constitutions of our own choice and making--and\\n', 'now we are unsheathing our sword to overturn them.\" The same year he\\n', 'burst out in a lament over rumors of restoring royal government. \"I am\\n', 'told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical government\\n', 'without horror. From thinking proceeds speaking. Hence to acting is\\n', 'often but a single step. But how irresistible and tremendous! What a\\n', 'triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions! What a triumph for\\n', 'the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing\\n', 'ourselves!\"\\n', '\\n', '=Congress Attempts Some Reforms.=--The Congress was not indifferent to\\n', 'the events that disturbed Washington. On the contrary it put forth many\\n', 'efforts to check tendencies so dangerous to finance, commerce,\\n', 'industries, and the Confederation itself. In 1781, even before the\\n', 'treaty of peace was signed, the Congress, having found out how futile\\n', 'were its taxing powers, carried a resolution of amendment to the\\n', 'Articles of Confederation, authorizing the levy of a moderate duty on\\n', 'imports. Yet this mild measure was rejected by the states. Two years\\n', 'later the Congress prepared another amendment sanctioning the levy of\\n', 'duties on imports, to be collected this time by state officers and\\n', 'applied to the payment of the public debt. This more limited proposal,\\n', 'designed to save public credit, likewise failed. In 1786, the Congress\\n', 'made a third appeal to the states for help, declaring that they had been\\n', 'so irregular and so negligent in paying their quotas that further\\n', 'reliance upon that mode of raising revenues was dishonorable and\\n', 'dangerous.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE CALLING OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION\\n', '\\n', '=Hamilton and Washington Urge Reform.=--The attempts at reform by the\\n', 'Congress were accompanied by demand for, both within and without that\\n', 'body, a convention to frame a new plan of government. In 1780, the\\n', 'youthful Alexander Hamilton, realizing the weakness of the Articles, so\\n', 'widely discussed, proposed a general convention for the purpose of\\n', 'drafting a new constitution on entirely different principles. With\\n', 'tireless energy he strove to bring his countrymen to his view.\\n', 'Washington, agreeing with him on every point, declared, in a circular\\n', 'letter to the governors, that the duration of the union would be short\\n', 'unless there was lodged somewhere a supreme power \"to regulate and\\n', 'govern the general concerns of the confederated republic.\" The governor\\n', 'of Massachusetts, disturbed by the growth of discontent all about him,\\n', 'suggested to the state legislature in 1785 the advisability of a\\n', 'national convention to enlarge the powers of the Congress. The\\n', 'legislature approved the plan, but did not press it to a conclusion.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: ALEXANDER HAMILTON]\\n', '\\n', '=The Annapolis Convention.=--Action finally came from the South. The\\n', 'Virginia legislature, taking things into its own hands, called a\\n', 'conference of delegates at Annapolis to consider matters of taxation and\\n', 'commerce. When the convention assembled in 1786, it was found that only\\n', 'five states had taken the trouble to send representatives. The leaders\\n', 'were deeply discouraged, but the resourceful Hamilton, a delegate from\\n', 'New York, turned the affair to good account. He secured the adoption of\\n', 'a resolution, calling upon the Congress itself to summon another\\n', 'convention, to meet at Philadelphia.\\n', '\\n', '=A National Convention Called (1787).=--The Congress, as tardy as ever,\\n', 'at last decided in February, 1787, to issue the call. Fearing drastic\\n', 'changes, however, it restricted the convention to \"the sole and express\\n', 'purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.\" Jealous of its own\\n', 'powers, it added that any alterations proposed should be referred to the\\n', 'Congress and the states for their approval.\\n', '\\n', 'Every state in the union, except Rhode Island, responded to this call.\\n', 'Indeed some of the states, having the Annapolis resolution before them,\\n', 'had already anticipated the Congress by selecting delegates before the\\n', 'formal summons came. Thus, by the persistence of governors,\\n', 'legislatures, and private citizens, there was brought about the\\n', 'long-desired national convention. In May, 1787, it assembled in\\n', 'Philadelphia.\\n', '\\n', '=The Eminent Men of the Convention.=--On the roll of that memorable\\n', 'convention were fifty-five men, at least half of whom were acknowledged\\n', 'to be among the foremost statesmen and thinkers in America. Every field\\n', 'of statecraft was represented by them: war and practical management in\\n', 'Washington, who was chosen president of the convention; diplomacy in\\n', 'Franklin, now old and full of honor in his own land as well as abroad;\\n', 'finance in Alexander Hamilton and Robert Morris; law in James Wilson of\\n', 'Pennsylvania; the philosophy of government in James Madison, called the\\n', '\"father of the Constitution.\" They were not theorists but practical men,\\n', 'rich in political experience and endowed with deep insight into the\\n', 'springs of human action. Three of them had served in the Stamp Act\\n', 'Congress: Dickinson of Delaware, William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut,\\n', 'and John Rutledge of South Carolina. Eight had been signers of the\\n', 'Declaration of Independence: Read of Delaware, Sherman of Connecticut,\\n', 'Wythe of Virginia, Gerry of Massachusetts, Franklin, Robert Morris,\\n', 'George Clymer, and James Wilson of Pennsylvania. All but twelve had at\\n', 'some time served in the Continental Congress and eighteen were members\\n', 'of that body in the spring of 1787. Washington, Hamilton, Mifflin, and\\n', 'Charles Pinckney had been officers in the Revolutionary army. Seven of\\n', 'the delegates had gained political experience as governors of states.\\n', '\"The convention as a whole,\" according to the historian Hildreth,\\n', '\"represented in a marked manner the talent, intelligence, and\\n', 'especially the conservative sentiment of the country.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE FRAMING OF THE CONSTITUTION\\n', '\\n', '=Problems Involved.=--The great problems before the convention were nine\\n', 'in number: (1) Shall the Articles of Confederation be revised or a new\\n', 'system of government constructed? (2) Shall the government be founded on\\n', 'states equal in power as under the Articles or on the broader and deeper\\n', 'foundation of population? (3) What direct share shall the people have in\\n', 'the election of national officers? (4) What shall be the qualifications\\n', 'for the suffrage? (5) How shall the conflicting interests of the\\n', 'commercial and the planting states be balanced so as to safeguard the\\n', 'essential rights of each? (6) What shall be the form of the new\\n', 'government? (7) What powers shall be conferred on it? (8) How shall the\\n', 'state legislatures be restrained from their attacks on property rights\\n', 'such as the issuance of paper money? (9) Shall the approval of all the\\n', 'states be necessary, as under the Articles, for the adoption and\\n', 'amendment of the Constitution?\\n', '\\n', '=Revision of the Articles or a New Government?=--The moment the first\\n', 'problem was raised, representatives of the small states, led by William\\n', 'Paterson of New Jersey, were on their feet. They feared that, if the\\n', 'Articles were overthrown, the equality and rights of the states would be\\n', 'put in jeopardy. Their protest was therefore vigorous. They cited the\\n', 'call issued by the Congress in summoning the convention which\\n', 'specifically stated that they were assembled for \"the sole and express\\n', 'purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.\" They cited also\\n', 'their instructions from their state legislatures, which authorized them\\n', 'to \"revise and amend\" the existing scheme of government, not to make a\\n', 'revolution in it. To depart from the authorization laid down by the\\n', 'Congress and the legislatures would be to exceed their powers, they\\n', 'argued, and to betray the trust reposed in them by their countrymen.\\n', '\\n', 'To their contentions, Randolph of Virginia replied: \"When the salvation\\n', 'of the republic is at stake, it would be treason to our trust not to\\n', 'propose what we find necessary.\" Hamilton, reminding the delegates that\\n', 'their work was still subject to the approval of the states, frankly said\\n', 'that on the point of their powers he had no scruples. With the issue\\n', 'clear, the convention cast aside the Articles as if they did not exist\\n', 'and proceeded to the work of drawing up a new constitution, \"laying its\\n', 'foundations on such principles and organizing its powers in such form\"\\n', 'as to the delegates seemed \"most likely to affect their safety and\\n', 'happiness.\"\\n', '\\n', '=A Government Founded on States or on People?--The\\n', 'Compromise.=--Defeated in their attempt to limit the convention to a\\n', 'mere revision of the Articles, the spokesmen of the smaller states\\n', 'redoubled their efforts to preserve the equality of the states. The\\n', 'signal for a radical departure from the Articles on this point was given\\n', 'early in the sessions when Randolph presented \"the Virginia plan.\" He\\n', 'proposed that the new national legislature consist of two houses, the\\n', 'members of which were to be apportioned among the states according to\\n', 'their wealth or free white population, as the convention might decide.\\n', 'This plan was vehemently challenged. Paterson of New Jersey flatly\\n', 'avowed that neither he nor his state would ever bow to such tyranny. As\\n', 'an alternative, he presented \"the New Jersey plan\" calling for a\\n', 'national legislature of one house representing states as such, not\\n', 'wealth or people--a legislature in which all states, large or small,\\n', 'would have equal voice. Wilson of Pennsylvania, on behalf of the more\\n', 'populous states, took up the gauntlet which Paterson had thrown down. It\\n', 'was absurd, he urged, for 180,000 men in one state to have the same\\n', 'weight in national counsels as 750,000 men in another state. \"The\\n', 'gentleman from New Jersey,\" he said, \"is candid. He declares his opinion\\n', 'boldly.... I will be equally candid.... I will never confederate on his\\n', 'principles.\" So the bitter controversy ran on through many exciting\\n', 'sessions.\\n', '\\n', 'Greek had met Greek. The convention was hopelessly deadlocked and on the\\n', 'verge of dissolution, \"scarce held together by the strength of a hair,\"\\n', 'as one of the delegates remarked. A crash was averted only by a\\n', 'compromise. Instead of a Congress of one house as provided by the\\n', 'Articles, the convention agreed upon a legislature of two houses. In the\\n', 'Senate, the aspirations of the small states were to be satisfied, for\\n', 'each state was given two members in that body. In the formation of the\\n', 'House of Representatives, the larger states were placated, for it was\\n', 'agreed that the members of that chamber were to be apportioned among the\\n', 'states on the basis of population, counting three-fifths of the slaves.\\n', '\\n', '=The Question of Popular Election.=--The method of selecting federal\\n', 'officers and members of Congress also produced an acrimonious debate\\n', 'which revealed how deep-seated was the distrust of the capacity of the\\n', 'people to govern themselves. Few there were who believed that no branch\\n', 'of the government should be elected directly by the voters; still fewer\\n', 'were there, however, who desired to see all branches so chosen. One or\\n', 'two even expressed a desire for a monarchy. The dangers of democracy\\n', 'were stressed by Gerry of Massachusetts: \"All the evils we experience\\n', 'flow from an excess of democracy. The people do not want virtue but are\\n', 'the dupes of pretended patriots.... I have been too republican\\n', 'heretofore but have been taught by experience the danger of a leveling\\n', 'spirit.\" To the \"democratic licentiousness of the state legislatures,\"\\n', 'Randolph sought to oppose a \"firm senate.\" To check the excesses of\\n', 'popular government Charles Pinckney of South Carolina declared that no\\n', 'one should be elected President who was not worth $100,000 and that high\\n', 'property qualifications should be placed on members of Congress and\\n', 'judges. Other members of the convention were stoutly opposed to such\\n', '\"high-toned notions of government.\" Franklin and Wilson, both from\\n', 'Pennsylvania, vigorously championed popular election; while men like\\n', 'Madison insisted that at least one part of the government should rest on\\n', 'the broad foundation of the people.\\n', '\\n', 'Out of this clash of opinion also came compromise. One branch, the House\\n', 'of Representatives, it was agreed, was to be elected directly by the\\n', 'voters, while the Senators were to be elected indirectly by the state\\n', 'legislatures. The President was to be chosen by electors selected as the\\n', 'legislatures of the states might determine, and the judges of the\\n', 'federal courts, supreme and inferior, by the President and the Senate.\\n', '\\n', '=The Question of the Suffrage.=--The battle over the suffrage was sharp\\n', 'but brief. Gouverneur Morris proposed that only land owners should be\\n', 'permitted to vote. Madison replied that the state legislatures, which\\n', 'had made so much trouble with radical laws, were elected by freeholders.\\n', 'After the debate, the delegates, unable to agree on any property\\n', 'limitations on the suffrage, decided that the House of Representatives\\n', 'should be elected by voters having the \"qualifications requisite for\\n', 'electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature.\" Thus\\n', 'they accepted the suffrage provisions of the states.\\n', '\\n', '=The Balance between the Planting and the Commercial States.=--After the\\n', 'debates had gone on for a few weeks, Madison came to the conclusion that\\n', 'the real division in the convention was not between the large and the\\n', 'small states but between the planting section founded on slave labor and\\n', 'the commercial North. Thus he anticipated by nearly three-quarters of a\\n', 'century \"the irrepressible conflict.\" The planting states had neither\\n', 'the free white population nor the wealth of the North. There were,\\n', 'counting Delaware, six of them as against seven commercial states.\\n', 'Dependent for their prosperity mainly upon the sale of tobacco, rice,\\n', 'and other staples abroad, they feared that Congress might impose\\n', 'restraints upon their enterprise. Being weaker in numbers, they were\\n', 'afraid that the majority might lay an unfair burden of taxes upon them.\\n', '\\n', '_Representation and Taxation._--The Southern members of the convention\\n', 'were therefore very anxious to secure for their section the largest\\n', 'possible representation in Congress, and at the same time to restrain\\n', 'the taxing power of that body. Two devices were thought adapted to these\\n', 'ends. One was to count the slaves as people when apportioning\\n', 'representatives among the states according to their respective\\n', 'populations; the other was to provide that direct taxes should be\\n', 'apportioned among the states, in proportion not to their wealth but to\\n', 'the number of their free white inhabitants. For obvious reasons the\\n', 'Northern delegates objected to these proposals. Once more a compromise\\n', 'proved to be the solution. It was agreed that not all the slaves but\\n', 'three-fifths of them should be counted for both purposes--representation\\n', 'and direct taxation.\\n', '\\n', '_Commerce and the Slave Trade._--Southern interests were also involved\\n', 'in the project to confer upon Congress the power to regulate interstate\\n', 'and foreign commerce. To the manufacturing and trading states this was\\n', 'essential. It would prevent interstate tariffs and trade jealousies; it\\n', 'would enable Congress to protect American manufactures and to break\\n', 'down, by appropriate retaliations, foreign discriminations against\\n', 'American commerce. To the South the proposal was menacing because\\n', 'tariffs might interfere with the free exchange of the produce of\\n', 'plantations in European markets, and navigation acts might confine the\\n', 'carrying trade to American, that is Northern, ships. The importation of\\n', 'slaves, moreover, it was feared might be heavily taxed or immediately\\n', 'prohibited altogether.\\n', '\\n', 'The result of this and related controversies was a debate on the merits\\n', 'of slavery. Gouverneur Morris delivered his mind and heart on that\\n', 'subject, denouncing slavery as a nefarious institution and the curse of\\n', 'heaven on the states in which it prevailed. Mason of Virginia, a\\n', 'slaveholder himself, was hardly less outspoken, saying: \"Slavery\\n', 'discourages arts and manufactures. The poor despise labor when performed\\n', 'by slaves. They prevent the migration of whites who really strengthen\\n', 'and enrich a country.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The system, however, had its defenders. Representatives from South\\n', 'Carolina argued that their entire economic life rested on slave labor\\n', 'and that the high death rate in the rice swamps made continuous\\n', 'importation necessary. Ellsworth of Connecticut took the ground that\\n', 'the convention should not meddle with slavery. \"The morality or wisdom\\n', 'of slavery,\" he said, \"are considerations belonging to the states. What\\n', 'enriches a part enriches the whole.\" To the future he turned an\\n', 'untroubled face: \"As population increases, poor laborers will be so\\n', 'plenty as to render slaves useless. Slavery in time will not be a speck\\n', 'in our country.\" Virginia and North Carolina, already overstocked with\\n', 'slaves, favored prohibiting the traffic in them; but South Carolina was\\n', 'adamant. She must have fresh supplies of slaves or she would not\\n', 'federate.\\n', '\\n', 'So it was agreed that, while Congress might regulate foreign trade by\\n', 'majority vote, the importation of slaves should not be forbidden before\\n', 'the lapse of twenty years, and that any import tax should not exceed $10\\n', 'a head. At the same time, in connection with the regulation of foreign\\n', 'trade, it was stipulated that a two-thirds vote in the Senate should be\\n', 'necessary in the ratification of treaties. A further concession to the\\n', 'South was made in the provision for the return of runaway slaves--a\\n', 'provision also useful in the North, where indentured servants were about\\n', 'as troublesome as slaves in escaping from their masters.\\n', '\\n', '=The Form of the Government.=--As to the details of the frame of\\n', 'government and the grand principles involved, the opinion of the\\n', 'convention ebbed and flowed, decisions being taken in the heat of\\n', 'debate, only to be revoked and taken again.\\n', '\\n', '_The Executive._--There was general agreement that there should be an\\n', 'executive branch; for reliance upon Congress to enforce its own laws and\\n', 'treaties had been a broken reed. On the character and functions of the\\n', 'executive, however, there were many views. The New Jersey plan called\\n', 'for a council selected by the Congress; the Virginia plan provided that\\n', 'the executive branch should be chosen by the Congress but did not state\\n', 'whether it should be composed of one or several persons. On this matter\\n', 'the convention voted first one way and then another; finally it agreed\\n', 'on a single executive chosen indirectly by electors selected as the\\n', 'state legislatures might decide, serving for four years, subject to\\n', 'impeachment, and endowed with regal powers in the command of the army\\n', 'and the navy and in the enforcement of the laws.\\n', '\\n', '_The Legislative Branch--Congress._--After the convention had made the\\n', 'great compromise between the large and small commonwealths by giving\\n', 'representation to states in the Senate and to population in the House,\\n', 'the question of methods of election had to be decided. As to the House\\n', 'of Representatives it was readily agreed that the members should be\\n', 'elected by direct popular vote. There was also easy agreement on the\\n', 'proposition that a strong Senate was needed to check the \"turbulence\" of\\n', 'the lower house. Four devices were finally selected to accomplish this\\n', 'purpose. In the first place, the Senators were not to be chosen directly\\n', 'by the voters but by the legislatures of the states, thus removing their\\n', 'election one degree from the populace. In the second place, their term\\n', 'was fixed at six years instead of two, as in the case of the House. In\\n', 'the third place, provision was made for continuity by having only\\n', 'one-third of the members go out at a time while two-thirds remained in\\n', 'service. Finally, it was provided that Senators must be at least thirty\\n', 'years old while Representatives need be only twenty-five.\\n', '\\n', '_The Judiciary._--The need for federal courts to carry out the law was\\n', 'hardly open to debate. The feebleness of the Articles of Confederation\\n', 'was, in a large measure, attributed to the want of a judiciary to hold\\n', 'states and individuals in obedience to the laws and treaties of the\\n', \"union. Nevertheless on this point the advocates of states' rights were\\n\", 'extremely sensitive. They looked with distrust upon judges appointed at\\n', 'the national capital and emancipated from local interests and\\n', 'traditions; they remembered with what insistence they had claimed\\n', 'against Britain the right of local trial by jury and with what\\n', 'consternation they had viewed the proposal to make colonial judges\\n', 'independent of the assemblies in the matter of their salaries.\\n', 'Reluctantly they yielded to the demand for federal courts, consenting at\\n', 'first only to a supreme court to review cases heard in lower state\\n', 'courts and finally to such additional inferior courts as Congress might\\n', 'deem necessary.\\n', '\\n', '_The System of Checks and Balances._--It is thus apparent that the\\n', 'framers of the Constitution, in shaping the form of government, arranged\\n', 'for a distribution of power among three branches, executive,\\n', 'legislative, and judicial. Strictly speaking we might say four branches,\\n', 'for the legislature, or Congress, was composed of two houses, elected in\\n', 'different ways, and one of them, the Senate, was made a check on the\\n', 'President through its power of ratifying treaties and appointments. \"The\\n', 'accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judicial, in the\\n', 'same hands,\" wrote Madison, \"whether of one, a few, or many, and whether\\n', 'hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the\\n', 'very definition of tyranny.\" The devices which the convention adopted to\\n', 'prevent such a centralization of authority were exceedingly ingenious\\n', 'and well calculated to accomplish the purposes of the authors.\\n', '\\n', 'The legislature consisted of two houses, the members of which were to be\\n', 'apportioned on a different basis, elected in different ways, and to\\n', 'serve for different terms. A veto on all its acts was vested in a\\n', 'President elected in a manner not employed in the choice of either\\n', 'branch of the legislature, serving for four years, and subject to\\n', 'removal only by the difficult process of impeachment. After a law had\\n', 'run the gantlet of both houses and the executive, it was subject to\\n', 'interpretation and annulment by the judiciary, appointed by the\\n', 'President with the consent of the Senate and serving for life. Thus it\\n', 'was made almost impossible for any political party to get possession of\\n', 'all branches of the government at a single popular election. As Hamilton\\n', 'remarked, the friends of good government considered \"every institution\\n', 'calculated to restrain the excess of law making and to keep things in\\n', 'the same state in which they happen to be at any given period as more\\n', 'likely to do good than harm.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Powers of the Federal Government.=--On the question of the powers\\n', 'to be conferred upon the new government there was less occasion for a\\n', 'serious dispute. Even the delegates from the small states agreed with\\n', 'those from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia that new powers\\n', 'should be added to those intrusted to Congress by the Articles of\\n', 'Confederation. The New Jersey plan as well as the Virginia plan\\n', 'recognized this fact. Some of the delegates, like Hamilton and Madison,\\n', 'even proposed to give Congress a general legislative authority covering\\n', 'all national matters; but others, frightened by the specter of\\n', 'nationalism, insisted on specifying each power to be conferred and\\n', 'finally carried the day.\\n', '\\n', '_Taxation and Commerce._--There were none bold enough to dissent from\\n', 'the proposition that revenue must be provided to pay current expenses\\n', 'and discharge the public debt. When once the dispute over the\\n', 'apportionment of direct taxes among the slave states was settled, it was\\n', 'an easy matter to decide that Congress should have power to lay and\\n', 'collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises. In this way the national\\n', 'government was freed from dependence upon stubborn and tardy\\n', 'legislatures and enabled to collect funds directly from citizens. There\\n', 'were likewise none bold enough to contend that the anarchy of state\\n', 'tariffs and trade discriminations should be longer endured. When the\\n', 'fears of the planting states were allayed and the \"bargain\" over the\\n', 'importation of slaves was reached, the convention vested in Congress the\\n', 'power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce.\\n', '\\n', '_National Defense._--The necessity for national defense was realized,\\n', 'though the fear of huge military establishments was equally present. The\\n', 'old practice of relying on quotas furnished by the state legislatures\\n', 'was completely discredited. As in the case of taxes a direct authority\\n', 'over citizens was demanded. Congress was therefore given full power to\\n', 'raise and support armies and a navy. It could employ the state militia\\n', 'when desirable; but it could at the same time maintain a regular army\\n', 'and call directly upon all able-bodied males if the nature of a crisis\\n', 'was thought to require it.\\n', '\\n', '_The \"Necessary and Proper\" Clause._--To the specified power vested in\\n', 'Congress by the Constitution, the advocates of a strong national\\n', 'government added a general clause authorizing it to make all laws\\n', '\"necessary and proper\" for carrying into effect any and all of the\\n', 'enumerated powers. This clause, interpreted by that master mind, Chief\\n', 'Justice Marshall, was later construed to confer powers as wide as the\\n', 'requirements of a vast country spanning a continent and taking its place\\n', 'among the mighty nations of the earth.\\n', '\\n', '=Restraints on the States.=--Framing a government and endowing it with\\n', 'large powers were by no means the sole concern of the convention. Its\\n', 'very existence had been due quite as much to the conduct of the state\\n', 'legislatures as to the futilities of a paralyzed Continental Congress.\\n', 'In every state, explains Marshall in his _Life of Washington_, there was\\n', 'a party of men who had \"marked out for themselves a more indulgent\\n', 'course. Viewing with extreme tenderness the case of the debtor, their\\n', 'efforts were unceasingly directed to his relief. To exact a faithful\\n', 'compliance with contracts was, in their opinion, a harsh measure which\\n', 'the people could not bear. They were uniformly in favor of relaxing the\\n', 'administration of justice, of affording facilities for the payment of\\n', 'debts, or of suspending their collection, and remitting taxes.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The legislatures under the dominance of these men had enacted paper\\n', 'money laws enabling debtors to discharge their obligations more easily.\\n', 'The convention put an end to such practices by providing that no state\\n', 'should emit bills of credit or make anything but gold or silver legal\\n', 'tender in the payment of debts. The state legislatures had enacted laws\\n', 'allowing men to pay their debts by turning over to creditors land or\\n', 'personal property; they had repealed the charter of an endowed college\\n', 'and taken the management from the hands of the lawful trustees; and they\\n', 'had otherwise interfered with the enforcement of private agreements. The\\n', 'convention, taking notice of such matters, inserted a clause forbidding\\n', 'states \"to impair the obligation of contracts.\" The more venturous of\\n', 'the radicals had in Massachusetts raised the standard of revolt against\\n', 'the authorities of the state. The convention answered by a brief\\n', 'sentence to the effect that the President of the United States, to be\\n', 'equipped with a regular army, would send troops to suppress domestic\\n', 'insurrections whenever called upon by the legislature or, if it was not\\n', 'in session, by the governor of the state. To make sure that the\\n', 'restrictions on the states would not be dead letters, the federal\\n', 'Constitution, laws, and treaties were made the supreme law of the land,\\n', 'to be enforced whenever necessary by a national judiciary and executive\\n', 'against violations on the part of any state authorities.\\n', '\\n', '=Provisions for Ratification and Amendment.=--When the frame of\\n', 'government had been determined, the powers to be vested in it had been\\n', 'enumerated, and the restrictions upon the states had been written into\\n', 'the bond, there remained three final questions. How shall the\\n', 'Constitution be ratified? What number of states shall be necessary to\\n', 'put it into effect? How shall it be amended in the future?\\n', '\\n', 'On the first point, the mandate under which the convention was sitting\\n', 'seemed positive. The Articles of Confederation were still in effect.\\n', 'They provided that amendments could be made only by unanimous adoption\\n', 'in Congress and the approval of all the states. As if to give force to\\n', 'this provision of law, the call for the convention had expressly stated\\n', 'that all alterations and revisions should be reported to Congress for\\n', 'adoption or rejection, Congress itself to transmit the document\\n', 'thereafter to the states for their review.\\n', '\\n', 'To have observed the strict letter of the law would have defeated the\\n', 'purposes of the delegates, because Congress and the state legislatures\\n', 'were openly hostile to such drastic changes as had been made. Unanimous\\n', 'ratification, as events proved, would have been impossible. Therefore\\n', 'the delegates decided that the Constitution should be sent to Congress\\n', 'with the recommendation that it, in turn, transmit the document, not to\\n', 'the state legislatures, but to conventions held in the states for the\\n', 'special object of deciding upon ratification. This process was followed.\\n', 'It was their belief that special conventions would be more friendly than\\n', 'the state legislatures.\\n', '\\n', 'The convention was equally positive in dealing with the problem of the\\n', 'number of states necessary to establish the new Constitution. Attempts\\n', 'to change the Articles had failed because amendment required the\\n', 'approval of every state and there was always at least one recalcitrant\\n', 'member of the union. The opposition to a new Constitution was\\n', 'undoubtedly formidable. Rhode Island had even refused to take part in\\n', 'framing it, and her hostility was deep and open. So the convention cast\\n', 'aside the provision of the Articles of Confederation which required\\n', 'unanimous approval for any change in the plan of government; it decreed\\n', 'that the new Constitution should go into effect when ratified by nine\\n', 'states.\\n', '\\n', 'In providing for future changes in the Constitution itself the\\n', 'convention also thrust aside the old rule of unanimous approval, and\\n', 'decided that an amendment could be made on a two-thirds vote in both\\n', 'houses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states. This\\n', 'change was of profound significance. Every state agreed to be bound in\\n', 'the future by amendments duly adopted even in case it did not approve\\n', 'them itself. America in this way set out upon the high road that led\\n', 'from a league of states to a nation.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE STRUGGLE OVER RATIFICATION\\n', '\\n', 'On September 17, 1787, the Constitution, having been finally drafted in\\n', 'clear and simple language, a model to all makers of fundamental law, was\\n', 'adopted. The convention, after nearly four months of debate in secret\\n', 'session, flung open the doors and presented to the Americans the\\n', 'finished plan for the new government. Then the great debate passed to\\n', 'the people.\\n', '\\n', '=The Opposition.=--Storms of criticism at once descended upon the\\n', 'Constitution. \"Fraudulent usurpation!\" exclaimed Gerry, who had refused\\n', 'to sign it. \"A monster\" out of the \"thick veil of secrecy,\" declaimed a\\n', 'Pennsylvania newspaper. \"An iron-handed despotism will be the result,\"\\n', 'protested a third. \"We, \\'the low-born,\\'\" sarcastically wrote a fourth,\\n', '\"will now admit the \\'six hundred well-born\\' immediately to establish\\n', 'this most noble, most excellent, and truly divine constitution.\" The\\n', 'President will become a king; Congress will be as tyrannical as\\n', 'Parliament in the old days; the states will be swallowed up; the rights\\n', \"of the people will be trampled upon; the poor man's justice will be lost\\n\", 'in the endless delays of the federal courts--such was the strain of the\\n', 'protests against ratification.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: AN ADVERTISEMENT OF _The Federalist_]\\n', '\\n', '=Defense of the Constitution.=--Moved by the tempest of opposition,\\n', 'Hamilton, Madison, and Jay took up their pens in defense of the\\n', 'Constitution. In a series of newspaper articles they discussed and\\n', 'expounded with eloquence, learning, and dignity every important clause\\n', 'and provision of the proposed plan. These papers, afterwards collected\\n', 'and published in a volume known as _The Federalist_, form the finest\\n', 'textbook on the Constitution that has ever been printed. It takes its\\n', 'place, moreover, among the wisest and weightiest treatises on government\\n', 'ever written in any language in any time. Other men, not so gifted, were\\n', 'no less earnest in their support of ratification. In private\\n', 'correspondence, editorials, pamphlets, and letters to the newspapers,\\n', 'they urged their countrymen to forget their partisanship and accept a\\n', 'Constitution which, in spite of any defects great or small, was the\\n', 'only guarantee against dissolution and warfare at home and dishonor and\\n', 'weakness abroad.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: CELEBRATING THE RATIFICATION]\\n', '\\n', '=The Action of the State Conventions.=--Before the end of the year,\\n', '1787, three states had ratified the Constitution: Delaware and New\\n', 'Jersey unanimously and Pennsylvania after a short, though savage,\\n', 'contest. Connecticut and Georgia followed early the next year. Then came\\n', 'the battle royal in Massachusetts, ending in ratification in February by\\n', 'the narrow margin of 187 votes to 168. In the spring came the news that\\n', 'Maryland and South Carolina were \"under the new roof.\" On June 21, New\\n', 'Hampshire, where the sentiment was at first strong enough to defeat the\\n', 'Constitution, joined the new republic, influenced by the favorable\\n', 'decision in Massachusetts.

Nine states had accepted it and were united, whether more saw\\n', 'fit to join or not.\\n', '\\n', 'Meanwhile, however, Virginia, after a long and searching debate, had\\n', 'given her approval by a narrow margin, leaving New York as the next seat\\n', 'of anxiety. In that state the popular vote for the delegates to the\\n', 'convention had been clearly and heavily against ratification.

Several members of the House of\\n', 'Representatives, headed by James Madison, had also been at Philadelphia\\n', 'in 1787. In making his appointments, Washington strengthened the new\\n', 'system of government still further by a judicious selection of\\n', 'officials. He chose as Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton,\\n', 'who had been the most zealous for its success; General Knox, head of the\\n', 'War Department, and Edmund Randolph, the Attorney-General, were likewise\\n', 'conspicuous friends of the experiment. Every member of the federal\\n', 'judiciary whom Washington appointed, from the Chief Justice, John Jay,\\n', 'down to the justices of the district courts, had favored the\\n', 'ratification of the Constitution; and a majority of them had served as\\n', 'members of the national convention that framed the document or of the\\n', 'state ratifying conventions. Only one man of influence in the new\\n', 'government, Thomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State, was reckoned as a\\n', 'doubter in the house of the faithful. He had expressed opinions both for\\n', 'and against the Constitution; but he had been out of the country acting\\n', 'as the minister at Paris when the Constitution was drafted and ratified.\\n', '\\n', '=An Opposition to Conciliate.=--The inauguration of Washington amid the\\n', 'plaudits of his countrymen did not set at rest all the political turmoil\\n', 'which had been aroused by the angry contest over ratification. \"The\\n', 'interesting nature of the question,\" wrote John Marshall, \"the equality\\n', 'of the parties, the animation produced inevitably by ardent debate had a\\n', 'necessary tendency to embitter the dispositions of the vanquished and to\\n', 'fix more deeply in many bosoms their prejudices against a plan of\\n', 'government in opposition to which all their passions were enlisted.\" The\\n', 'leaders gathered around Washington were well aware of the excited state\\n', 'of the country. They saw Rhode Island and North Carolina still outside\\n', 'of the union.[1] They knew by what small margins the Constitution had\\n', 'been approved in the great states of Massachusetts, Virginia, and New\\n', 'York. They were equally aware that a majority of the state conventions,\\n', 'in yielding reluctant approval to the Constitution, had drawn a number\\n', 'of amendments for immediate submission to the states.\\n', '\\n', '=The First Amendments--a Bill of Rights.=--To meet the opposition,\\n', 'Madison proposed, and the first Congress adopted, a series of amendments\\n', 'to the Constitution. Ten of them were soon ratified and became in 1791 a\\n', 'part of the law of the land. These amendments provided, among other\\n', 'things, that Congress could make no law respecting the establishment of\\n', 'religion, abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right\\n', 'of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for a\\n', 'redress of grievances. They also guaranteed indictment by grand jury and\\n', 'trial by jury for all persons charged by federal officers with serious\\n', 'crimes. To reassure those who still feared that local rights might be\\n', 'invaded by the federal government, the tenth amendment expressly\\n', 'provided that the powers not delegated to the United States by the\\n', 'Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the\\n', 'states respectively or to the people. Seven years later, the eleventh\\n', 'amendment was written in the same spirit as the first ten, after a\\n', 'heated debate over the action of the Supreme Court in permitting a\\n', 'citizen to bring a suit against \"the sovereign state\" of Georgia. The\\n', 'new amendment was designed to protect states against the federal\\n', 'judiciary by forbidding it to hear any case in which a state was sued by\\n', 'a citizen.\\n', '\\n', '=Funding the National Debt.=--Paper declarations of rights, however,\\n', 'paid no bills. To this task Hamilton turned all his splendid genius. At\\n', 'the very outset he addressed himself to the problem of the huge public\\n', 'debt, daily mounting as the unpaid interest accumulated. In a _Report on\\n', 'Public Credit_ under date of January 9, 1790, one of the first and\\n', 'greatest of American state papers, he laid before Congress the outlines\\n', 'of his plan. He proposed that the federal government should call in all\\n', 'the old bonds, certificates of indebtedness, and other promises to pay\\n', 'which had been issued by the Congress since the beginning of the\\n', 'Revolution. These national obligations, he urged, should be put into one\\n', 'consolidated debt resting on the credit of the United States; to the\\n', 'holders of the old paper should be issued new bonds drawing interest at\\n', 'fixed rates. This process was called \"funding the debt.\" Such a\\n', 'provision for the support of public credit, Hamilton insisted, would\\n', 'satisfy creditors, restore landed property to its former value, and\\n', 'furnish new resources to agriculture and commerce in the form of credit\\n', 'and capital.\\n', '\\n', '=Assumption and Funding of State Debts.=--Hamilton then turned to the\\n', 'obligations incurred by the several states in support of the Revolution.\\n', 'These debts he proposed to add to the national debt. They were to be\\n', '\"assumed\" by the United States government and placed on the same secure\\n', 'foundation as the continental debt. This measure he defended not merely\\n', 'on grounds of national honor. It would, as he foresaw, give strength to\\n', 'the new national government by making all public creditors, men of\\n', 'substance in their several communities, look to the federal, rather than\\n', 'the state government, for the satisfaction of their claims.\\n', '\\n', '=Funding at Face Value.=--On the question of the terms of consolidation,\\n', 'assumption, and funding, Hamilton had a firm conviction. That millions\\n', \"of dollars' worth of the continental and state bonds had passed out of\\n\", 'the hands of those who had originally subscribed their funds to the\\n', 'support of the government or had sold supplies for the Revolutionary\\n', 'army was well known. It was also a matter of common knowledge that a\\n', 'very large part of these bonds had been bought by speculators at ruinous\\n', 'figures--ten, twenty, and thirty cents on the dollar. Accordingly, it\\n', 'had been suggested, even in very respectable quarters, that a\\n', 'discrimination should be made between original holders and speculative\\n', 'purchasers. Some who held this opinion urged that the speculators who\\n', 'had paid nominal sums for their bonds should be reimbursed for their\\n', 'outlays and the original holders paid the difference; others said that\\n', 'the government should \"scale the debt\" by redeeming, not at full value\\n', 'but at a figure reasonably above the market price. Against the\\n', 'proposition Hamilton set his face like flint. He maintained that the\\n', 'government was honestly bound to redeem every bond at its face value,\\n', 'although the difficulty of securing revenue made necessary a lower rate\\n', 'of interest on a part of the bonds and the deferring of interest on\\n', 'another part.\\n', '\\n', '=Funding and Assumption Carried.=--There was little difficulty in\\n', 'securing the approval of both houses of Congress for the funding of the\\n', 'national debt at full value. The bill for the assumption of state debts,\\n', 'however, brought the sharpest division of opinions. To the Southern\\n', \"members of Congress assumption was a gross violation of states' rights,\\n\", 'without any warrant in the Constitution and devised in the interest of\\n', 'Northern speculators who, anticipating assumption and funding, had\\n', 'bought up at low prices the Southern bonds and other promises to pay.\\n', 'New England, on the other hand, was strongly in favor of assumption;\\n', 'several representatives from that section were rash enough to threaten a\\n', 'dissolution of the union if the bill was defeated. To this dispute was\\n', 'added an equally bitter quarrel over the location of the national\\n', 'capital, then temporarily at New York City.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: FIRST UNITED STATES BANK AT PHILADELPHIA]\\n', '\\n', 'A deadlock, accompanied by the most surly feelings on both sides,\\n', 'threatened the very existence of the young government. Washington and\\n', 'Hamilton were thoroughly alarmed. Hearing of the extremity to which the\\n', 'contest had been carried and acting on the appeal from the Secretary of\\n', 'the Treasury, Jefferson intervened at this point. By skillful management\\n', 'at a good dinner he brought the opposing leaders together; and thus once\\n', 'more, as on many other occasions, peace was purchased and the union\\n', 'saved by compromise. The bargain this time consisted of an exchange of\\n', 'votes for assumption in return for votes for the capital. Enough\\n', 'Southern members voted for assumption to pass the bill, and a majority\\n', 'was mustered in favor of building the capital on the banks of the\\n', 'Potomac, after locating it for a ten-year period at Philadelphia to\\n', 'satisfy Pennsylvania members.\\n', '\\n', '=The United States Bank.=--Encouraged by the success of his funding and\\n', 'assumption measures, Hamilton laid before Congress a project for a great\\n', 'United States Bank. He proposed that a private corporation be chartered\\n', 'by Congress, authorized to raise a capital stock of $10,000,000\\n', '(three-fourths in new six per cent federal bonds and one-fourth in\\n', 'specie) and empowered to issue paper currency under proper safeguards.\\n', 'Many advantages, Hamilton contended, would accrue to the government from\\n', 'this institution. The price of the government bonds would be increased,\\n', 'thus enhancing public credit. A national currency would be created of\\n', 'uniform value from one end of the land to the other. The branches of the\\n', 'bank in various cities would make easy the exchange of funds so vital to\\n', 'commercial transactions on a national scale. Finally, through the issue\\n', 'of bank notes, the money capital available for agriculture and industry\\n', 'would be increased, thus stimulating business enterprise. Jefferson\\n', 'hotly attacked the bank on the ground that Congress had no power\\n', 'whatever under the Constitution to charter such a private corporation.\\n', 'Hamilton defended it with great cogency. Washington, after weighing all\\n', 'opinions, decided in favor of the proposal. In 1791 the bill\\n', 'establishing the first United States Bank for a period of twenty years\\n', 'became a law.\\n', '\\n', \"=The Protective Tariff.=--A third part of Hamilton's program was the\\n\", 'protection of American industries. The first revenue act of 1789, though\\n', 'designed primarily to bring money into the empty treasury, declared in\\n', 'favor of the principle. The following year Washington referred to the\\n', 'subject in his address to Congress. Thereupon Hamilton was instructed to\\n', 'prepare recommendations for legislative action. The result, after a\\n', 'delay of more than a year, was his _Report on Manufactures_, another\\n', 'state paper worthy, in closeness of reasoning and keenness of\\n', 'understanding, of a place beside his report on public credit. Hamilton\\n', 'based his argument on the broadest national grounds: the protective\\n', 'tariff would, by encouraging the building of factories, create a home\\n', 'market for the produce of farms and plantations; by making the United\\n', 'States independent of other countries in times of peace, it would double\\n', 'its security in time of war; by making use of the labor of women and\\n', 'children, it would turn to the production of goods persons otherwise\\n', 'idle or only partly employed; by increasing the trade between the North\\n', 'and South it would strengthen the links of union and add to political\\n', 'ties those of commerce and intercourse. The revenue measure of 1792 bore\\n', 'the impress of these arguments.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE RISE OF POLITICAL PARTIES\\n', '\\n', \"=Dissensions over Hamilton's Measures.=--Hamilton's plans, touching\\n\", 'deeply as they did the resources of individuals and the interests of the\\n', 'states, awakened alarm and opposition. Funding at face value, said his\\n', 'critics, was a government favor to speculators; the assumption of state\\n', 'debts was a deep design to undermine the state governments; Congress had\\n', 'no constitutional power to create a bank; the law creating the bank\\n', 'merely allowed a private corporation to make paper money and lend it at\\n', 'a high rate of interest; and the tariff was a tax on land and labor for\\n', 'the benefit of manufacturers.\\n', '\\n', \"Hamilton's reply to this bill of indictment was simple and\\n\", 'straightforward. Some rascally speculators had profited from the funding\\n', 'of the debt at face value, but that was only an incident in the\\n', 'restoration of public credit. In view of the jealousies of the states it\\n', 'was a good thing to reduce their powers and pretensions. The\\n', 'Constitution was not to be interpreted narrowly but in the full light of\\n', 'national needs. The bank would enlarge the amount of capital so sorely\\n', 'needed to start up American industries, giving markets to farmers and\\n', 'planters. The tariff by creating a home market and increasing\\n', 'opportunities for employment would benefit both land and labor. Out of\\n', 'such wise policies firmly pursued by the government, he concluded, were\\n', 'bound to come strength and prosperity for the new government at home,\\n', 'credit and power abroad. This view Washington fully indorsed, adding\\n', 'the weight of his great name to the inherent merits of the measures\\n', 'adopted under his administration.\\n', '\\n', '=The Sharpness of the Partisan Conflict.=--As a result of the clash of\\n', 'opinion, the people of the country gradually divided into two parties:\\n', 'Federalists and Anti-Federalists, the former led by Hamilton, the latter\\n', 'by Jefferson. The strength of the Federalists lay in the cities--Boston,\\n', 'Providence, Hartford, New York, Philadelphia, Charleston--among the\\n', 'manufacturing, financial, and commercial groups of the population who\\n', 'were eager to extend their business operations. The strength of the\\n', 'Anti-Federalists lay mainly among the debt-burdened farmers who feared\\n', 'the growth of what they called \"a money power\" and planters in all\\n', 'sections who feared the dominance of commercial and manufacturing\\n', 'interests. The farming and planting South, outside of the few towns,\\n', 'finally presented an almost solid front against assumption, the bank,\\n', 'and the tariff. The conflict between the parties grew steadily in\\n', 'bitterness, despite the conciliatory and engaging manner in which\\n', 'Hamilton presented his cause in his state papers and despite the\\n', 'constant efforts of Washington to soften the asperity of the\\n', 'contestants.\\n', '\\n', '=The Leadership and Doctrines of Jefferson.=--The party dispute had not\\n', 'gone far before the opponents of the administration began to look to\\n', \"Jefferson as their leader. Some of Hamilton's measures he had approved,\\n\", 'declaring afterward that he did not at the time understand their\\n', 'significance. Others, particularly the bank, he fiercely assailed. More\\n', 'than once, he and Hamilton, shaking violently with anger, attacked each\\n', 'other at cabinet meetings, and nothing short of the grave and dignified\\n', 'pleas of Washington prevented an early and open break between them. In\\n', '1794 it finally came. Jefferson resigned as Secretary of State and\\n', 'retired to his home in Virginia to assume, through correspondence and\\n', 'negotiation, the leadership of the steadily growing party of opposition.\\n', '\\n', 'Shy and modest in manner, halting in speech, disliking the turmoil of\\n', 'public debate, and deeply interested in science and philosophy,\\n', 'Jefferson was not very well fitted for the strenuous life of political\\n', 'contest. Nevertheless, he was an ambitious and shrewd negotiator. He was\\n', 'also by honest opinion and matured conviction the exact opposite of\\n', 'Hamilton. The latter believed in a strong, active, \"high-toned\"\\n', 'government, vigorously compelling in all its branches. Jefferson looked\\n', 'upon such government as dangerous to the liberties of citizens and\\n', 'openly avowed his faith in the desirability of occasional popular\\n', 'uprisings. Hamilton distrusted the people. \"Your people is a great\\n', 'beast,\" he is reported to have said. Jefferson professed his faith in\\n', 'the people with an abandon that was considered reckless in his time.\\n', '\\n', 'On economic matters, the opinions of the two leaders were also\\n', 'hopelessly at variance. Hamilton, while cherishing agriculture, desired\\n', 'to see America a great commercial and industrial nation. Jefferson was\\n', 'equally set against this course for his country. He feared the\\n', 'accumulation of riches and the growth of a large urban working class.\\n', 'The mobs of great cities, he said, are sores on the body politic;\\n', 'artisans are usually the dangerous element that make revolutions;\\n', 'workshops should be kept in Europe and with them the artisans with their\\n', 'insidious morals and manners. The only substantial foundation for a\\n', 'republic, Jefferson believed to be agriculture. The spirit of\\n', 'independence could be kept alive only by free farmers, owning the land\\n', 'they tilled and looking to the sun in heaven and the labor of their\\n', 'hands for their sustenance. Trusting as he did in the innate goodness of\\n', 'human nature when nourished on a free soil, Jefferson advocated those\\n', 'measures calculated to favor agriculture and to enlarge the rights of\\n', 'persons rather than the powers of government. Thus he became the\\n', 'champion of the individual against the interference of the government,\\n', 'and an ardent advocate of freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and\\n', 'freedom of scientific inquiry. It was, accordingly, no mere factious\\n', 'spirit that drove him into opposition to Hamilton.\\n', '\\n', '=The Whisky Rebellion.=--The political agitation of the Anti-Federalists\\n', 'was accompanied by an armed revolt against the government in 1794. The\\n', \"occasion for this uprising was another of Hamilton's measures, a law\\n\", 'laying an excise tax on distilled spirits, for the purpose of increasing\\n', 'the revenue needed to pay the interest on the funded debt. It so\\n', 'happened that a very considerable part of the whisky manufactured in the\\n', 'country was made by the farmers, especially on the frontier, in their\\n', 'own stills. The new revenue law meant that federal officers would now\\n', 'come into the homes of the people, measure their liquor, and take the\\n', 'tax out of their pockets. All the bitterness which farmers felt against\\n', 'the fiscal measures of the government was redoubled. In the western\\n', 'districts of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina, they refused to\\n', 'pay the tax. In Pennsylvania, some of them sacked and burned the houses\\n', 'of the tax collectors, as the Revolutionists thirty years before had\\n', 'mobbed the agents of King George sent over to sell stamps. They were in\\n', 'a fair way to nullify the law in whole districts when Washington called\\n', 'out the troops to suppress \"the Whisky Rebellion.\" Then the movement\\n', 'collapsed; but it left behind a deep-seated resentment which flared up\\n', 'in the election of several obdurate Anti-Federalist Congressmen from the\\n', 'disaffected regions.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'FOREIGN INFLUENCES AND DOMESTIC POLITICS\\n', '\\n', '=The French Revolution.=--In this exciting period, when all America was\\n', 'distracted by partisan disputes, a storm broke in Europe--the\\n', 'epoch-making French Revolution--which not only shook the thrones of the\\n', 'Old World but stirred to its depths the young republic of the New World.\\n', 'The first scene in this dramatic affair occurred in the spring of 1789,\\n', 'a few days after Washington was inaugurated. The king of France, Louis\\n', 'XVI, driven into bankruptcy by extravagance and costly wars, was forced\\n', 'to resort to his people for financial help. Accordingly he called, for\\n', 'the first time in more than one hundred fifty years, a meeting of the\\n', 'national parliament, the \"Estates General,\" composed of representatives\\n', 'of the \"three estates\"--the clergy, nobility, and commoners. Acting\\n', 'under powerful leaders, the commoners, or \"third estate,\" swept aside\\n', 'the clergy and nobility and resolved themselves into a national\\n', 'assembly. This stirred the country to its depths.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', 'LOUIS XVI IN THE HANDS OF THE MOB]\\n', '\\n', 'Great events followed in swift succession. On July 14, 1789, the\\n', \"Bastille, an old royal prison, symbol of the king's absolutism, was\\n\", 'stormed by a Paris crowd and destroyed. On the night of August 4, the\\n', 'feudal privileges of the nobility were abolished by the national\\n', 'assembly amid great excitement. A few days later came the famous\\n', 'Declaration of the Rights of Man, proclaiming the sovereignty of the\\n', 'people and the privileges of citizens. In the autumn of 1791, Louis XVI\\n', 'was forced to accept a new constitution for France vesting the\\n', 'legislative power in a popular assembly. Little disorder accompanied\\n', 'these startling changes. To all appearances a peaceful revolution had\\n', 'stripped the French king of his royal prerogatives and based the\\n', 'government of his country on the consent of the governed.\\n', '\\n', '=American Influence in France.=--In undertaking their great political\\n', 'revolt the French had been encouraged by the outcome of the American\\n', 'Revolution. Officers and soldiers, who had served in the American war,\\n', 'reported to their French countrymen marvelous tales. At the frugal table\\n', 'of General Washington, in council with the unpretentious Franklin, or at\\n', 'conferences over the strategy of war, French noblemen of ancient lineage\\n', 'learned to respect both the talents and the simple character of the\\n', 'leaders in the great republican commonwealth beyond the seas. Travelers,\\n', 'who had gone to see the experiment in republicanism with their own eyes,\\n', 'carried home to the king and ruling class stories of an astounding\\n', 'system of popular government.\\n', '\\n', 'On the other hand the dalliance with American democracy was regarded by\\n', 'French conservatives as playing with fire. \"When we think of the false\\n', 'ideas of government and philanthropy,\" wrote one of Lafayette\\'s aides,\\n', '\"which these youths acquired in America and propagated in France with so\\n', 'much enthusiasm and such deplorable success--for this mania of imitation\\n', 'powerfully aided the Revolution, though it was not the sole cause of\\n', 'it--we are bound to confess that it would have been better, both for\\n', 'themselves and for us, if these young philosophers in red-heeled shoes\\n', 'had stayed at home in attendance on the court.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Early American Opinion of the French Revolution.=--So close were the\\n', 'ties between the two nations that it is not surprising to find every\\n', 'step in the first stages of the French Revolution greeted with applause\\n', 'in the United States. \"Liberty will have another feather in her cap,\"\\n', 'exultantly wrote a Boston editor. \"In no part of the globe,\" soberly\\n', 'wrote John Marshall, \"was this revolution hailed with more joy than in\\n', 'America.... But one sentiment existed.\" The main key to the Bastille,\\n', 'sent to Washington as a memento, was accepted as \"a token of the\\n', 'victory gained by liberty.\" Thomas Paine saw in the great event \"the\\n', 'first ripe fruits of American principles transplanted into Europe.\"\\n', 'Federalists and Anti-Federalists regarded the new constitution of France\\n', 'as another vindication of American ideals.\\n', '\\n', '=The Reign of Terror.=--While profuse congratulations were being\\n', 'exchanged, rumors began to come that all was not well in France. Many\\n', 'noblemen, enraged at the loss of their special privileges, fled into\\n', 'Germany and plotted an invasion of France to overthrow the new system of\\n', 'government. Louis XVI entered into negotiations with his brother\\n', 'monarchs on the continent to secure their help in the same enterprise,\\n', 'and he finally betrayed to the French people his true sentiments by\\n', 'attempting to escape from his kingdom, only to be captured and taken\\n', 'back to Paris in disgrace.\\n', '\\n', 'A new phase of the revolution now opened. The working people, excluded\\n', 'from all share in the government by the first French constitution,\\n', 'became restless, especially in Paris. Assembling on the Champs de Mars,\\n', 'a great open field, they signed a petition calling for another\\n', 'constitution giving them the suffrage. When told to disperse, they\\n', 'refused and were fired upon by the national guard. This \"massacre,\" as\\n', 'it was called, enraged the populace. A radical party, known as\\n', '\"Jacobins,\" then sprang up, taking its name from a Jacobin monastery in\\n', 'which it held its sessions. In a little while it became the master of\\n', 'the popular convention convoked in September, 1792. The monarchy was\\n', 'immediately abolished and a republic established. On January 21, 1793,\\n', 'Louis was sent to the scaffold. To the war on Austria, already raging,\\n', 'was added a war on England. Then came the Reign of Terror, during which\\n', 'radicals in possession of the convention executed in large numbers\\n', 'counter-revolutionists and those suspected of sympathy with the\\n', 'monarchy. They shot down peasants who rose in insurrection against their\\n', 'rule and established a relentless dictatorship. Civil war followed.\\n', 'Terrible atrocities were committed on both sides in the name of liberty,\\n', 'and in the name of monarchy. To Americans of conservative temper it now\\n', 'seemed that the Revolution, so auspiciously begun, had degenerated into\\n', 'anarchy and mere bloodthirsty strife.\\n', '\\n', '=Burke Summons the World to War on France.=--In England, Edmund Burke\\n', 'led the fight against the new French principles which he feared might\\n', 'spread to all Europe. In his _Reflections on the French Revolution_,\\n', 'written in 1790, he attacked with terrible wrath the whole program of\\n', 'popular government; he called for war, relentless war, upon the French\\n', 'as monsters and outlaws; he demanded that they be reduced to order by\\n', 'the restoration of the king to full power under the protection of the\\n', 'arms of European nations.\\n', '\\n', \"=Paine's Defense of the French Revolution.=--To counteract the campaign\\n\", 'of hate against the French, Thomas Paine replied to Burke in another of\\n', 'his famous tracts, _The Rights of Man_, which was given to the American\\n', 'public in an edition containing a letter of approval from Jefferson.\\n', 'Burke, said Paine, had been mourning about the glories of the French\\n', 'monarchy and aristocracy but had forgotten the starving peasants and the\\n', 'oppressed people; had wept over the plumage and neglected the dying\\n', 'bird. Burke had denied the right of the French people to choose their\\n', 'own governors, blandly forgetting that the English government in which\\n', 'he saw final perfection itself rested on two revolutions. He had boasted\\n', 'that the king of England held his crown in contempt of the democratic\\n', 'societies. Paine answered: \"If I ask a man in America if he wants a\\n', 'king, he retorts and asks me if I take him for an idiot.\" To the charge\\n', 'that the doctrines of the rights of man were \"new fangled,\" Paine\\n', 'replied that the question was not whether they were new or old but\\n', 'whether they were right or wrong. As to the French disorders and\\n', 'difficulties, he bade the world wait to see what would be brought forth\\n', 'in due time.\\n', '\\n', '=The Effect of the French Revolution on American Politics.=--The course\\n', 'of the French Revolution and the controversies accompanying it,\\n', 'exercised a profound influence on the formation of the first political\\n', 'parties in America. The followers of Hamilton, now proud of the name\\n', '\"Federalists,\" drew back in fright as they heard of the cruel deeds\\n', 'committed during the Reign of Terror. They turned savagely upon the\\n', 'revolutionists and their friends in America, denouncing as \"Jacobin\"\\n', 'everybody who did not condemn loudly enough the proceedings of the\\n', 'French Republic. A Massachusetts preacher roundly assailed \"the\\n', 'atheistical, anarchical, and in other respects immoral principles of the\\n', 'French Republicans\"; he then proceeded with equal passion to attack\\n', 'Jefferson and the Anti-Federalists, whom he charged with spreading false\\n', 'French propaganda and betraying America. \"The editors, patrons, and\\n', 'abettors of these vehicles of slander,\" he exclaimed, \"ought to be\\n', 'considered and treated as enemies to their country.... Of all traitors\\n', 'they are the most aggravatedly criminal; of all villains, they are the\\n', 'most infamous and detestable.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Anti-Federalists, as a matter of fact, were generally favorable to\\n', 'the Revolution although they deplored many of the events associated with\\n', \"it. Paine's pamphlet, indorsed by Jefferson, was widely read. Democratic\\n\", 'societies, after the fashion of French political clubs, arose in the\\n', 'cities; the coalition of European monarchs against France was denounced\\n', 'as a coalition against the very principles of republicanism; and the\\n', 'execution of Louis XVI was openly celebrated at a banquet in\\n', 'Philadelphia. Harmless titles, such as \"Sir,\" \"the Honorable,\" and \"His\\n', 'Excellency,\" were decried as aristocratic and some of the more excited\\n', 'insisted on adopting the French title, \"Citizen,\" speaking, for example,\\n', 'of \"Citizen Judge\" and \"Citizen Toastmaster.\" Pamphlets in defense of\\n', 'the French streamed from the press, while subsidized newspapers kept the\\n', 'propaganda in full swing.\\n', '\\n', '=The European War Disturbs American Commerce.=--This battle of wits, or\\n', 'rather contest in calumny, might have gone on indefinitely in America\\n', 'without producing any serious results, had it not been for the war\\n', 'between England and France, then raging. The English, having command of\\n', 'the seas, claimed the right to seize American produce bound for French\\n', 'ports and to confiscate American ships engaged in carrying French goods.\\n', 'Adding fuel to a fire already hot enough, they began to search American\\n', 'ships and to carry off British-born sailors found on board American\\n', 'vessels.\\n', '\\n', '=The French Appeal for Help.=--At the same time the French Republic\\n', 'turned to the United States for aid in its war on England and sent over\\n', 'as its diplomatic representative \"Citizen\" Genet, an ardent supporter of\\n', 'the new order. On his arrival at Charleston, he was greeted with fervor\\n', 'by the Anti-Federalists. As he made his way North, he was wined and\\n', 'dined and given popular ovations that turned his head. He thought the\\n', 'whole country was ready to join the French Republic in its contest with\\n', 'England. Genet therefore attempted to use the American ports as the base\\n', 'of operations for French privateers preying on British merchant ships;\\n', 'and he insisted that the United States was in honor bound to help France\\n', 'under the treaty of 1778.\\n', '\\n', '=The Proclamation of Neutrality and the Jay Treaty.=--Unmoved by the\\n', '\\n', 'rising tide of popular sympathy for France, Washington took a firm\\n', 'course. He received Genet coldly. The demand that the United States aid\\n', 'France under the old treaty of alliance he answered by proclaiming the\\n', 'neutrality of America and warning American citizens against hostile acts\\n', 'toward either France or England. When Genet continued to hold meetings,\\n', 'issue manifestoes, and stir up the people against England, Washington\\n', 'asked the French government to recall him. This act he followed up by\\n', 'sending the Chief Justice, John Jay, on a pacific mission to England.\\n', '\\n', 'The result was the celebrated Jay treaty of 1794. By its terms Great\\n', 'Britain agreed to withdraw her troops from the western forts where they\\n', 'had been since the war for independence and to grant certain slight\\n', 'trade concessions. The chief sources of bitterness--the failure of the\\n', 'British to return slaves carried off during the Revolution, the seizure\\n', 'of American ships, and the impressment of sailors--were not touched,\\n', 'much to the distress of everybody in America, including loyal\\n', 'Federalists. Nevertheless, Washington, dreading an armed conflict with\\n', 'England, urged the Senate to ratify the treaty. The weight of his\\n', 'influence carried the day.\\n', '\\n', 'At this, the hostility of the Anti-Federalists knew no bounds. Jefferson\\n', 'declared the Jay treaty \"an infamous act which is really nothing more\\n', 'than an alliance between England and the Anglo-men of this country,\\n', 'against the legislature and the people of the United States.\" Hamilton,\\n', 'defending it with his usual courage, was stoned by a mob in New York and\\n', 'driven from the platform with blood streaming from his face. Jay was\\n', 'burned in effigy. Even Washington was not spared. The House of\\n', 'Representatives was openly hostile. To display its feelings, it called\\n', 'upon the President for the papers relative to the treaty negotiations,\\n', 'only to be more highly incensed by his flat refusal to present them, on\\n', 'the ground that the House did not share in the treaty-making power.\\n', '\\n', '=Washington Retires from Politics.=--Such angry contests confirmed the\\n', 'President in his slowly maturing determination to retire at the end of\\n', 'his second term in office. He did not believe that a third term was\\n', 'unconstitutional or improper; but, worn out by his long and arduous\\n', 'labors in war and in peace and wounded by harsh attacks from former\\n', 'friends, he longed for the quiet of his beautiful estate at Mount\\n', 'Vernon.\\n', '\\n', 'In September, 1796, on the eve of the presidential election, Washington\\n', 'issued his Farewell Address, another state paper to be treasured and\\n', 'read by generations of Americans to come. In this address he directed\\n', 'the attention of the people to three subjects of lasting interest. He\\n', 'warned them against sectional jealousies. He remonstrated against the\\n', 'spirit of partisanship, saying that in government \"of the popular\\n', 'character, in government purely elective, it is a spirit not to be\\n', 'encouraged.\" He likewise cautioned the people against \"the insidious\\n', 'wiles of foreign influence,\" saying: \"Europe has a set of primary\\n', 'interests which to us have none or a very remote relation. Hence she\\n', 'must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are\\n', 'essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it would be\\n', 'unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary\\n', 'vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions\\n', 'of her friendships or enmities.... Why forego the advantages of so\\n', 'peculiar a situation?... It is our true policy to steer clear of\\n', 'permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.... Taking\\n', 'care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on a\\n', 'respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary\\n', 'alliances for extraordinary emergencies.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Campaign of 1796--Adams Elected.=--On hearing of the retirement of\\n', 'Washington, the Anti-Federalists cast off all restraints. In honor of\\n', 'France and in opposition to what they were pleased to call the\\n', 'monarchical tendencies of the Federalists, they boldly assumed the name\\n', '\"Republican\"; the term \"Democrat,\" then applied only to obscure and\\n', 'despised radicals, had not come into general use. They selected\\n', 'Jefferson as their candidate for President against John Adams, the\\n', 'Federalist nominee, and carried on such a spirited campaign that they\\n', 'came within four votes of electing him.\\n', '\\n', 'The successful candidate, Adams, was not fitted by training or opinion\\n', 'for conciliating a determined opposition. He was a reserved and studious\\n', 'man. He was neither a good speaker nor a skillful negotiator. In one of\\n', 'his books he had declared himself in favor of \"government by an\\n', 'aristocracy of talents and wealth\"--an offense which the Republicans\\n', 'never forgave. While John Marshall found him \"a sensible, plain, candid,\\n', 'good-tempered man,\" Jefferson could see in him nothing but a \"monocrat\"\\n', 'and \"Anglo-man.\" Had it not been for the conduct of the French\\n', \"government, Adams would hardly have enjoyed a moment's genuine\\n\", 'popularity during his administration.\\n', '\\n', '=The Quarrel with France.=--The French Directory, the executive\\n', 'department established under the constitution of 1795, managed, however,\\n', 'to stir the anger of Republicans and Federalists alike. It regarded the\\n', 'Jay treaty as a rebuke to France and a flagrant violation of obligations\\n', 'solemnly registered in the treaty of 1778. Accordingly it refused to\\n', 'receive the American minister, treated him in a humiliating way, and\\n', 'finally told him to leave the country. Overlooking this affront in his\\n', 'anxiety to maintain peace, Adams dispatched to France a commission of\\n', 'eminent men with instructions to reach an understanding with the French\\n', 'Republic. On their arrival, they were chagrined to find, instead of a\\n', 'decent reception, an indirect demand for an apology respecting the past\\n', 'conduct of the American government, a payment in cash, and an annual\\n', 'tribute as the price of continued friendship. When the news of this\\n', 'affair reached President Adams, he promptly laid it before Congress,\\n', 'referring to the Frenchmen who had made the demands as \"Mr. X, Mr. Y,\\n', 'and Mr. Z.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This insult, coupled with the fact that French privateers, like the\\n', 'British, were preying upon American commerce, enraged even the\\n', 'Republicans who had been loudest in the profession of their French\\n', 'sympathies. They forgot their wrath over the Jay treaty and joined with\\n', 'the Federalists in shouting: \"Millions for defense, not a cent for\\n', 'tribute!\" Preparations for war were made on every hand. Washington was\\n', 'once more called from Mount Vernon to take his old position at the head\\n', 'of the army. Indeed, fighting actually began upon the high seas and went\\n', 'on without a formal declaration of war until the year 1800. By that time\\n', 'the Directory had been overthrown. A treaty was readily made with\\n', 'Napoleon, the First Consul, who was beginning his remarkable career as\\n', 'chief of the French Republic, soon to be turned into an empire.\\n', '\\n', '=Alien and Sedition Laws.=--Flushed with success, the Federalists\\n', 'determined, if possible, to put an end to radical French influence in\\n', 'America and to silence Republican opposition. They therefore passed two\\n', 'drastic laws in the summer of 1798: the Alien and Sedition Acts.\\n', '\\n', 'The first of these measures empowered the President to expel from the\\n', 'country or to imprison any alien whom he regarded as \"dangerous\" or \"had\\n', 'reasonable grounds to suspect\" of \"any treasonable or secret\\n', 'machinations against the government.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The second of the measures, the Sedition Act, penalized not only those\\n', 'who attempted to stir up unlawful combinations against the government\\n', 'but also every one who wrote, uttered, or published \"any false,\\n', 'scandalous, and malicious writing ... against the government of the\\n', 'United States or either House of Congress, or the President of the\\n', 'United States, with intent to defame said government ... or to bring\\n', 'them or either of them into contempt or disrepute.\" This measure was\\n', 'hurried through Congress in spite of the opposition and the clear\\n', 'provision in the Constitution that Congress shall make no law abridging\\n', 'the freedom of speech or of the press. Even many Federalists feared the\\n', 'consequences of the action. Hamilton was alarmed when he read the bill,\\n', 'exclaiming: \"Let us not establish a tyranny. Energy is a very different\\n', 'thing from violence.\" John Marshall told his friends in Virginia that,\\n', 'had he been in Congress, he would have opposed the two bills because he\\n', 'thought them \"useless\" and \"calculated to create unnecessary discontents\\n', 'and jealousies.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Alien law was not enforced; but it gave great offense to the Irish\\n', \"and French whose activities against the American government's policy\\n\", 'respecting Great Britain put them in danger of prison. The Sedition law,\\n', 'on the other hand, was vigorously applied. Several editors of Republican\\n', 'newspapers soon found themselves in jail or broken by ruinous fines for\\n', 'their caustic criticisms of the Federalist President and his policies.\\n', 'Bystanders at political meetings, who uttered sentiments which, though\\n', 'ungenerous and severe, seem harmless enough now, were hurried before\\n', 'Federalist judges and promptly fined and imprisoned. Although the\\n', 'prosecutions were not numerous, they aroused a keen resentment. The\\n', 'Republicans were convinced that their political opponents, having\\n', \"saddled upon the country Hamilton's fiscal system and the British\\n\", 'treaty, were bent on silencing all censure. The measures therefore had\\n', 'exactly the opposite effect from that which their authors intended.\\n', 'Instead of helping the Federalist party, they made criticism of it more\\n', 'bitter than ever.\\n', '\\n', '=The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions.=--Jefferson was quick to take\\n', 'advantage of the discontent. He drafted a set of resolutions declaring\\n', 'the Sedition law null and void, as violating the federal Constitution.\\n', 'His resolutions were passed by the Kentucky legislature late in 1798,\\n', 'signed by the governor, and transmitted to the other states for their\\n', 'consideration. Though receiving unfavorable replies from a number of\\n', 'Northern states, Kentucky the following year reaffirmed its position and\\n', 'declared that the nullification of all unconstitutional acts of Congress\\n', 'was the rightful remedy to be used by the states in the redress of\\n', 'grievances. It thus defied the federal government and announced a\\n', 'doctrine hostile to nationality and fraught with terrible meaning for\\n', 'the future. In the neighboring state of Virginia, Madison led a movement\\n', 'against the Alien and Sedition laws. He induced the legislature to pass\\n', 'resolutions condemning the acts as unconstitutional and calling upon the\\n', 'other states to take proper means to preserve their rights and the\\n', 'rights of the people.\\n', '\\n', '=The Republican Triumph in 1800.=--Thus the way was prepared for the\\n', 'election of 1800. The Republicans left no stone unturned in their\\n', 'efforts to place on the Federalist candidate, President Adams, all the\\n', 'odium of the Alien and Sedition laws, in addition to responsibility for\\n', \"approving Hamilton's measures and policies. The Federalists, divided in\\n\", 'councils and cold in their affection for Adams, made a poor campaign.\\n', 'They tried to discredit their opponents with epithets of \"Jacobins\" and\\n', '\"Anarchists\"--terms which had been weakened by excessive use. When the\\n', 'vote was counted, it was found that Adams had been defeated; while the\\n', 'Republicans had carried the entire South and New York also and secured\\n', 'eight of the fifteen electoral votes cast by Pennsylvania. \"Our beloved\\n', 'Adams will now close his bright career,\" lamented a Federalist\\n', 'newspaper. \"Sons of faction, demagogues and high priests of anarchy, now\\n', 'you have cause to triumph!\"\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _An old cartoon_\\n', '\\n', 'A QUARREL BETWEEN A FEDERALIST AND A REPUBLICAN IN THE HOUSE OF\\n', 'REPRESENTATIVES]\\n', '\\n', \"Jefferson's election, however, was still uncertain. By a curious\\n\", 'provision in the Constitution, presidential electors were required to\\n', 'vote for two persons without indicating which office each was to fill,\\n', 'the one receiving the highest number of votes to be President and the\\n', 'candidate standing next to be Vice President. It so happened that Aaron\\n', 'Burr, the Republican candidate for Vice President, had received the same\\n', 'number of votes as Jefferson; as neither had a majority the election was\\n', 'thrown into the House of Representatives, where the Federalists held the\\n', 'balance of power. Although it was well known that Burr was not even a\\n', 'candidate for President, his friends and many Federalists began\\n', 'intriguing for his election to that high office. Had it not been for the\\n', 'vigorous action of Hamilton the prize might have been snatched out of\\n', \"Jefferson's hands. Not until the thirty-sixth ballot on February 17,\\n\", '1801, was the great issue decided in his favor.[2]\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', 'J.S.

Their attachment to\\n', 'America was, certainly, as strong as that of Hamilton; but they regarded\\n', 'the state, rather than the national government, as the proper center of\\n', 'power and affection. Indeed, a large part of the rank and file had been\\n', 'among the opponents of the Constitution in the days of its adoption.\\n', 'Jefferson had entertained doubts about it and Monroe, destined to be the\\n', 'fifth President, had been one of the bitter foes of ratification. The\\n', 'former went so far in the direction of local autonomy that he exalted\\n', 'the state above the nation in the Kentucky resolutions of 1798,\\n', 'declaring the Constitution to be a mere compact and the states competent\\n', 'to interpret and nullify federal law. This was provincialism with a\\n', 'vengeance. \"It is jealousy, not confidence, which prescribes limited\\n', 'constitutions,\" wrote Jefferson for the Kentucky legislature. Jealousy\\n', 'of the national government, not confidence in it--this is the ideal that\\n', 'reflected the provincial and agricultural interest.\\n', '\\n', '=Republican Simplicity.=--Every act of the Jeffersonian party during its\\n', 'early days of power was in accord with the ideals of government which it\\n', 'professed. It had opposed all pomp and ceremony, calculated to give\\n', 'weight and dignity to the chief executive of the nation, as symbols of\\n', \"monarchy and high prerogative. Appropriately, therefore, Jefferson's\\n\", 'inauguration on March 4, 1801, the first at the new capital at\\n', 'Washington, was marked by extreme simplicity. In keeping with this\\n', 'procedure he quit the practice, followed by Washington and Adams, of\\n', 'reading presidential addresses to Congress in joint assembly and adopted\\n', 'in its stead the plan of sending his messages in writing--a custom that\\n', 'was continued unbroken until 1913 when President Wilson returned to the\\n', 'example set by the first chief magistrate.\\n', '\\n', '=Republican Measures.=--The Republicans had complained of a great\\n', 'national debt as the source of a dangerous \"money power,\" giving\\n', 'strength to the federal government; accordingly they began to pay it off\\n', 'as rapidly as possible. They had held commerce in low esteem and looked\\n', 'upon a large navy as a mere device to protect it; consequently they\\n', 'reduced the number of warships. They had objected to excise taxes,\\n', 'particularly on whisky; these they quickly abolished, to the intense\\n', 'satisfaction of the farmers. They had protested against the heavy cost\\n', 'of the federal government; they reduced expenses by discharging hundreds\\n', 'of men from the army and abolishing many offices.\\n', '\\n', 'They had savagely criticized the Sedition law and Jefferson refused to\\n', 'enforce it. They had been deeply offended by the assault on freedom of\\n', 'speech and press and they promptly impeached Samuel Chase, a justice of\\n', 'the Supreme Court, who had been especially severe in his attacks upon\\n', 'offenders under the Sedition Act. Their failure to convict Justice Chase\\n', 'by a narrow margin was due to no lack of zeal on their part but to the\\n', 'Federalist strength in the Senate where the trial was held. They had\\n', 'regarded the appointment of a large number of federal judges during the\\n', \"last hours of Adams' administration as an attempt to intrench\\n\", 'Federalists in the judiciary and to enlarge the sphere of the national\\n', 'government. Accordingly, they at once repealed the act creating the new\\n', 'judgeships, thus depriving the \"midnight appointees\" of their posts.\\n', 'They had considered the federal offices, civil and military, as sources\\n', 'of great strength to the Federalists and Jefferson, though committed to\\n', 'the principle that offices should be open to all and distributed\\n', 'according to merit, was careful to fill most of the vacancies as they\\n', 'occurred with trusted Republicans. To his credit, however, it must be\\n', 'said that he did not make wholesale removals to find room for party\\n', 'workers.\\n', '\\n', 'The Republicans thus hewed to the line of their general policy of\\n', 'restricting the weight, dignity, and activity of the national\\n', 'government. Yet there were no Republicans, as the Federalists asserted,\\n', 'prepared to urge serious modifications in the Constitution. \"If there be\\n', 'any among us who wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican\\n', 'form,\" wrote Jefferson in his first inaugural, \"let them stand\\n', 'undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may\\n', 'be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.\" After reciting the\\n', 'fortunate circumstances of climate, soil, and isolation which made the\\n', 'future of America so full of promise, Jefferson concluded: \"A wise and\\n', 'frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another,\\n', 'shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of\\n', 'industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the\\n', 'bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government; and this is\\n', 'necessary to close the circle of our felicities.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In all this the Republicans had not reckoned with destiny. In a few\\n', 'short years that lay ahead it was their fate to double the territory of\\n', 'the country, making inevitable a continental nation; to give the\\n', 'Constitution a generous interpretation that shocked many a Federalist;\\n', 'to wage war on behalf of American commerce; to reestablish the hated\\n', 'United States Bank; to enact a high protective tariff; to see their\\n', 'Federalist opponents in their turn discredited as nullifiers and\\n', 'provincials; to announce high national doctrines in foreign affairs; and\\n', 'to behold the Constitution exalted and defended against the pretensions\\n', 'of states by a son of old Virginia, John Marshall, Chief Justice of the\\n', 'Supreme Court of the United States.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE REPUBLICANS AND THE GREAT WEST\\n', '\\n', '=Expansion and Land Hunger.=--The first of the great measures which\\n', 'drove the Republicans out upon this new national course--the purchase\\n', 'of the Louisiana territory--was the product of circumstances rather than\\n', 'of their deliberate choosing. It was not the lack of land for his\\n', 'cherished farmers that led Jefferson to add such an immense domain to\\n', 'the original possessions of the United States. In the Northwest\\n', 'territory, now embracing Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin,\\n', 'and a portion of Minnesota, settlements were mainly confined to the\\n', 'north bank of the Ohio River. To the south, in Kentucky and Tennessee,\\n', 'where there were more than one hundred thousand white people who had\\n', 'pushed over the mountains from Virginia and the Carolinas, there were\\n', 'still wide reaches of untilled soil. The Alabama and Mississippi regions\\n', 'were vast Indian frontiers of the state of Georgia, unsettled and almost\\n', 'unexplored. Even to the wildest imagination there seemed to be territory\\n', 'enough to satisfy the land hunger of the American people for a century\\n', 'to come.\\n', '\\n', '=The Significance of the Mississippi River.=--At all events the East,\\n', 'then the center of power, saw no good reason for expansion. The planters\\n', 'of the Carolinas, the manufacturers of Pennsylvania, the importers of\\n', 'New York, the shipbuilders of New England, looking to the seaboard and\\n', 'to Europe for trade, refinements, and sometimes their ideas of\\n', 'government, were slow to appreciate the place of the West in national\\n', 'economy. The better educated the Easterners were, the less, it seems,\\n', 'they comprehended the destiny of the nation. Sons of Federalist fathers\\n', 'at Williams College, after a long debate decided by a vote of fifteen to\\n', 'one that the purchase of Louisiana was undesirable.\\n', '\\n', 'On the other hand, the pioneers of Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee,\\n', 'unlearned in books, saw with their own eyes the resources of the\\n', 'wilderness. Many of them had been across the Mississippi and had beheld\\n', 'the rich lands awaiting the plow of the white man. Down the great river\\n', 'they floated their wheat, corn, and bacon to ocean-going ships bound for\\n', 'the ports of the seaboard or for Europe. The land journeys over the\\n', 'mountain barriers with bulky farm produce, they knew from experience,\\n', 'were almost impossible, and costly at best. Nails, bolts of cloth, tea,\\n', 'and coffee could go or come that way, but not corn and bacon. A free\\n', 'outlet to the sea by the Mississippi was as essential to the pioneers of\\n', 'the Kentucky region as the harbor of Boston to the merchant princes of\\n', 'that metropolis.\\n', '\\n', '=Louisiana under Spanish Rule.=--For this reason they watched with deep\\n', 'solicitude the fortunes of the Spanish king to whom, at the close of the\\n', \"Seven Years' War, had fallen the Louisiana territory stretching from New\\n\", 'Orleans to the Rocky Mountains. While he controlled the mouth of the\\n', 'Mississippi there was little to fear, for he had neither the army nor\\n', 'the navy necessary to resist any invasion of American trade. Moreover,\\n', 'Washington had been able, by the exercise of great tact, to secure from\\n', 'Spain in 1795 a trading privilege through New Orleans which satisfied\\n', 'the present requirements of the frontiersmen even if it did not allay\\n', 'their fears for the future. So things stood when a swift succession of\\n', 'events altered the whole situation.\\n', '\\n', '=Louisiana Transferred to France.=--In July, 1802, a royal order from\\n', 'Spain instructed the officials at New Orleans to close the port to\\n', 'American produce. About the same time a disturbing rumor, long current,\\n', 'was confirmed--Napoleon had coerced Spain into returning Louisiana to\\n', 'France by a secret treaty signed in 1800. \"The scalers of the Alps and\\n', 'conquerors of Venice\" now looked across the sea for new scenes of\\n', 'adventure. The West was ablaze with excitement. A call for war ran\\n', 'through the frontier; expeditions were organized to prevent the landing\\n', 'of the French; and petitions for instant action flooded in upon\\n', 'Jefferson.\\n', '\\n', '=Jefferson Sees the Danger.=--Jefferson, the friend of France and sworn\\n', 'enemy of England, compelled to choose in the interest of America, never\\n', 'winced. \"The cession of Louisiana and the Floridas by Spain to France,\"\\n', 'he wrote to Livingston, the American minister in Paris, \"works sorely on\\n', 'the United States. It completely reverses all the political relations of\\n', 'the United States and will form a new epoch in our political course....\\n', 'There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our\\n', 'natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans through which the produce\\n', 'of three-eighths of our territory must pass to market.... France,\\n', 'placing herself in that door, assumes to us an attitude of defiance.\\n', 'Spain might have retained it quietly for years. Her pacific\\n', 'dispositions, her feeble state would induce her to increase our\\n', 'facilities there.... Not so can it ever be in the hands of France....\\n', 'The day that France takes possession of New Orleans fixes the sentence\\n', 'which is to restrain her forever within her low water mark.... It seals\\n', 'the union of the two nations who in conjunction can maintain exclusive\\n', 'possession of the ocean. From that moment we must marry ourselves to the\\n', 'British fleet and nation.... This is not a state of things we seek or\\n', 'desire. It is one which this measure, if adopted by France, forces on us\\n', 'as necessarily as any other cause by the laws of nature brings on its\\n', 'necessary effect.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Louisiana Purchased.=--Acting on this belief, but apparently seeing\\n', 'only the Mississippi outlet at stake, Jefferson sent his friend, James\\n', 'Monroe, to France with the power to buy New Orleans and West Florida.\\n', 'Before Monroe arrived, the regular minister, Livingston, had already\\n', 'convinced Napoleon that it would be well to sell territory which might\\n', 'be wrested from him at any moment by the British sea power, especially\\n', 'as the war, temporarily stopped by the peace of Amiens, was once more\\n', 'raging in Europe. Wise as he was in his day, Livingston had at first no\\n', 'thought of buying the whole Louisiana country. He was simply dazed when\\n', 'Napoleon offered to sell the entire domain and get rid of the business\\n', 'altogether. Though staggered by the proposal, he and Monroe decided to\\n', 'accept. On April 30, they signed the treaty of cession, agreeing to pay\\n', '$11,250,000 in six per cent bonds and to discharge certain debts due\\n', 'French citizens, making in all approximately fifteen millions. Spain\\n', \"protested, Napoleon's brother fumed, French newspapers objected; but the\\n\", 'deed was done.\\n', '\\n', '=Jefferson and His Constitutional Scruples.=--When the news of this\\n', 'extraordinary event reached the United States, the people were filled\\n', 'with astonishment, and no one was more surprised than Jefferson himself.\\n', 'He had thought of buying New Orleans and West Florida for a small sum,\\n', 'and now a vast domain had been dumped into the lap of the nation. He was\\n', 'puzzled. On looking into the Constitution he found not a line\\n', 'authorizing the purchase of more territory and so he drafted an\\n', 'amendment declaring \"Louisiana, as ceded by France,--a part of the\\n', 'United States.\" He had belabored the Federalists for piling up a big\\n', 'national debt and he could hardly endure the thought of issuing more\\n', 'bonds himself.\\n', '\\n', 'In the midst of his doubts came the news that Napoleon might withdraw\\n', 'from the bargain. Thoroughly alarmed by that, Jefferson pressed the\\n', 'Senate for a ratification of the treaty. He still clung to his original\\n', 'idea that the Constitution did not warrant the purchase; but he lamely\\n', 'concluded: \"If our friends shall think differently, I shall certainly\\n', 'acquiesce with satisfaction; confident that the good sense of our\\n', 'country will correct the evil of construction when it shall produce ill\\n', 'effects.\" Thus the stanch advocate of \"strict interpretation\" cut loose\\n', 'from his own doctrine and intrusted the construction of the Constitution\\n', 'to \"the good sense\" of his countrymen.\\n', '\\n', '=The Treaty Ratified.=--This unusual transaction, so favorable to the\\n', 'West, aroused the ire of the seaboard Federalists. Some denounced it as\\n', \"unconstitutional, easily forgetting Hamilton's masterly defense of the\\n\", 'bank, also not mentioned in the Constitution. Others urged that, if \"the\\n', 'howling wilderness\" ever should be settled, it would turn against the\\n', 'East, form new commercial connections, and escape from federal control.\\n', 'Still others protested that the purchase would lead inevitably to the\\n', 'dominance of a \"hotch potch of wild men from the Far West.\" Federalists,\\n', 'who thought \"the broad back of America\" could readily bear Hamilton\\'s\\n', 'consolidated debt, now went into agonies over a bond issue of less than\\n', \"one-sixth of that amount. But in vain. Jefferson's party with a high\\n\", 'hand carried the day. The Senate, after hearing the Federalist protest,\\n', 'ratified the treaty. In December, 1803, the French flag was hauled down\\n', 'from the old government buildings in New Orleans and the Stars and\\n', 'Stripes were hoisted as a sign that the land of Coronado, De Soto,\\n', 'Marquette, and La Salle had passed forever to the United States.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1805]\\n', '\\n', 'By a single stroke, the original territory of the United States was more\\n', 'than doubled. While the boundaries of the purchase were uncertain, it is\\n', 'safe to say that the Louisiana territory included what is now Arkansas,\\n', 'Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and large\\n', 'portions of Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, Colorado, Montana, and\\n', 'Wyoming. The farm lands that the friends of \"a little America\" on the\\n', 'seacoast declared a hopeless wilderness were, within a hundred years,\\n', 'fully occupied and valued at nearly seven billion dollars--almost five\\n', 'hundred times the price paid to Napoleon.\\n', '\\n', '=Western Explorations.=--Having taken the fateful step, Jefferson wisely\\n', 'began to make the most of it. He prepared for the opening of the new\\n', 'country by sending the Lewis and Clark expedition to explore it,\\n', 'discover its resources, and lay out an overland route through the\\n', 'Missouri Valley and across the Great Divide to the Pacific. The story of\\n', 'this mighty exploit, which began in the spring of 1804 and ended in the\\n', 'autumn of 1806, was set down with skill and pains in the journal of\\n', 'Lewis and Clark; when published even in a short form, it invited the\\n', 'forward-looking men of the East to take thought about the western\\n', 'empire. At the same time Zebulon Pike, in a series of journeys, explored\\n', 'the sources of the Mississippi River and penetrated the Spanish\\n', 'territories of the far Southwest. Thus scouts and pioneers continued the\\n', 'work of diplomats.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE REPUBLICAN WAR FOR COMMERCIAL INDEPENDENCE\\n', '\\n', '=The English and French Blockades.=--In addition to bringing Louisiana\\n', 'to the United States, the reopening of the European War in 1803, after a\\n', 'short lull, renewed in an acute form the commercial difficulties that\\n', 'had plagued the country all during the administrations of Washington and\\n', \"Adams. The Republicans were now plunged into the hornets' nest. The\\n\", 'party whose ardent spirits had burned Jay in effigy, stoned Hamilton for\\n', \"defending his treaty, jeered Washington's proclamation of neutrality,\\n\", 'and spoken bitterly of \"timid traders,\" could no longer take refuge in\\n', 'criticism. It had to act.\\n', '\\n', 'Its troubles took a serious turn in 1806. England, in a determined\\n', 'effort to bring France to her knees by starvation, declared the coast of\\n', 'Europe blockaded from Brest to the mouth of the Elbe River. Napoleon\\n', 'retaliated by his Berlin Decree of November, 1806, blockading the\\n', 'British Isles--a measure terrifying to American ship owners whose\\n', 'vessels were liable to seizure by any French rover, though Napoleon had\\n', 'no navy to make good his proclamation. Great Britain countered with a\\n', 'still more irritating decree--the Orders in Council of 1807. It modified\\n', 'its blockade, but in so doing merely authorized American ships not\\n', 'carrying munitions of war to complete their voyage to the Continent, on\\n', 'condition of their stopping at a British port, securing a license, and\\n', 'paying a tax. This, responded Napoleon, was the height of insolence, and\\n', 'he denounced it as a gross violation of international law. He then\\n', 'closed the circle of American troubles by issuing his Milan Decree of\\n', 'December, 1807. This order declared that any ship which complied with\\n', 'the British rules would be subject to seizure and confiscation by French\\n', 'authorities.\\n', '\\n', '=The Impressment of Seamen.=--That was not all. Great Britain, in dire\\n', 'need of men for her navy, adopted the practice of stopping American\\n', 'ships, searching them, and carrying away British-born sailors found on\\n', 'board. British sailors were so badly treated, so cruelly flogged for\\n', 'trivial causes, and so meanly fed that they fled in crowds to the\\n', 'American marine. In many cases it was difficult to tell whether seamen\\n', 'were English or American. They spoke the same language, so that language\\n', 'was no test. Rovers on the deep and stragglers in the ports of both\\n', 'countries, they frequently had no papers to show their nativity.\\n', 'Moreover, Great Britain held to the old rule--\"Once an Englishman,\\n', 'always an Englishman\"--a doctrine rejected by the United States in\\n', 'favor of the principle that a man could choose the nation to which he\\n', 'would give allegiance. British sea captains, sometimes by mistake, and\\n', 'often enough with reckless indifference, carried away into servitude in\\n', 'their own navy genuine American citizens. The process itself, even when\\n', 'executed with all the civilities of law, was painful enough, for it\\n', 'meant that American ships were forced to \"come to,\" and compelled to\\n', 'rest submissively under British guns until the searching party had pried\\n', 'into records, questioned seamen, seized and handcuffed victims. Saints\\n', 'could not have done this work without raising angry passions, and only\\n', 'saints could have endured it with patience and fortitude.\\n', '\\n', 'Had the enactment of the scenes been confined to the high seas and\\n', 'knowledge of them to rumors and newspaper stories, American resentment\\n', 'might not have been so intense; but many a search and seizure was made\\n', 'in sight of land. British and French vessels patrolled the coasts,\\n', 'firing on one another and chasing one another in American waters within\\n', 'the three-mile limit. When, in the summer of 1807, the American frigate\\n', '_Chesapeake_ refused to surrender men alleged to be deserters from King\\n', \"George's navy, the British warship _Leopard_ opened fire, killing three\\n\", 'men and wounding eighteen more--an act which even the British ministry\\n', 'could hardly excuse. If the French were less frequently the offenders,\\n', 'it was not because of their tenderness about American rights but because\\n', 'so few of their ships escaped the hawk-eyed British navy to operate in\\n', 'American waters.\\n', '\\n', '=The Losses in American Commerce.=--This high-handed conduct on the part\\n', 'of European belligerents was very injurious to American trade. By their\\n', 'enterprise, American shippers had become the foremost carriers on the\\n', 'Atlantic Ocean. In a decade they had doubled the tonnage of American\\n', 'merchant ships under the American flag, taking the place of the French\\n', 'marine when Britain swept that from the seas, and supplying Britain with\\n', 'the sinews of war for the contest with the Napoleonic empire. The\\n', 'American shipping engaged in foreign trade embraced 363,110 tons in\\n', '1791; 669,921 tons in 1800; and almost 1,000,000 tons in 1810. Such was\\n', 'the enterprise attacked by the British and French decrees. American\\n', 'ships bound for Great Britain were liable to be captured by French\\n', 'privateers which, in spite of the disasters of the Nile and Trafalgar,\\n', 'ranged the seas. American ships destined for the Continent, if they\\n', 'failed to stop at British ports and pay tribute, were in great danger of\\n', 'capture by the sleepless British navy and its swarm of auxiliaries.\\n', 'American sea captains who, in fear of British vengeance, heeded the\\n', 'Orders in Council and paid the tax were almost certain to fall a prey to\\n', 'French vengeance, for the French were vigorous in executing the Milan\\n', 'Decree.\\n', '\\n', \"=Jefferson's Policy.=--The President's dilemma was distressing. Both the\\n\", 'belligerents in Europe were guilty of depredations on American commerce.\\n', 'War on both of them was out of the question. War on France was\\n', 'impossible because she had no territory on this side of the water which\\n', 'could be reached by American troops and her naval forces had been\\n', 'shattered at the battles of the Nile and Trafalgar. War on Great\\n', \"Britain, a power which Jefferson's followers feared and distrusted, was\\n\", 'possible but not inviting. Jefferson shrank from it. A man of peace, he\\n', \"disliked war's brazen clamor; a man of kindly spirit, he was startled at\\n\", 'the death and destruction which it brought in its train. So for the\\n', 'eight years Jefferson steered an even course, suggesting measure after\\n', 'measure with a view to avoiding bloodshed. He sent, it is true,\\n', 'Commodore Preble in 1803 to punish Mediterranean pirates preying upon\\n', 'American commerce; but a great war he evaded with passionate\\n', 'earnestness, trying in its place every other expedient to protect\\n', 'American rights.\\n', '\\n', '=The Embargo and Non-intercourse Acts.=--In 1806, Congress passed and\\n', 'Jefferson approved a non-importation act closing American ports to\\n', 'certain products from British dominions--a measure intended as a club\\n', \"over the British government's head. This law, failing in its purpose,\\n\", 'Jefferson proposed and Congress adopted in December, 1807, the Embargo\\n', 'Act forbidding all vessels to leave American harbors for foreign ports.\\n', 'France and England were to be brought to terms by cutting off their\\n', 'supplies.\\n', '\\n', 'The result of the embargo was pathetic. England and France refused to\\n', 'give up search and seizure. American ship owners who, lured by huge\\n', 'profits, had formerly been willing to take the risk were now restrained\\n', 'by law to their home ports. Every section suffered. The South and West\\n', 'found their markets for cotton, rice, tobacco, corn, and bacon\\n', 'curtailed. Thus they learned by bitter experience the national\\n', 'significance of commerce. Ship masters, ship builders, longshoremen, and\\n', 'sailors were thrown out of employment while the prices of foreign goods\\n', 'doubled. Those who obeyed the law were ruined; violators of the law\\n', 'smuggled goods into Canada and Florida for shipment abroad.\\n', '\\n', \"Jefferson's friends accepted the medicine with a wry face as the only\\n\", 'alternative to supine submission or open war. His opponents, without\\n', 'offering any solution of their own, denounced it as a contemptible plan\\n', 'that brought neither relief nor honor. Beset by the clamor that arose on\\n', \"all sides, Congress, in the closing days of Jefferson's administration,\\n\", 'repealed the Embargo law and substituted a Non-intercourse act\\n', 'forbidding trade with England and France while permitting it with other\\n', 'countries--a measure equally futile in staying the depredations on\\n', 'American shipping.\\n', '\\n', '=Jefferson Retires in Favor of Madison.=--Jefferson, exhausted by\\n', 'endless wrangling and wounded, as Washington had been, by savage\\n', 'criticism, welcomed March 4, 1809. His friends urged him to \"stay by the\\n', 'ship\" and accept a third term. He declined, saying that election for\\n', \"life might result from repeated reelection. In following Washington's\\n\", 'course and defending it on principle, he set an example to all his\\n', 'successors, making the \"third term doctrine\" a part of American\\n', 'unwritten law.\\n', '\\n', 'His intimate friend, James Madison, to whom he turned over the burdens\\n', 'of his high office was, like himself, a man of peace. Madison had been a\\n', 'leader since the days of the Revolution, but in legislative halls and\\n', 'council chambers, not on the field of battle. Small in stature,\\n', 'sensitive in feelings, studious in habits, he was no man for the rough\\n', 'and tumble of practical politics. He had taken a prominent and\\n', 'distinguished part in the framing and the adoption of the Constitution.\\n', \"He had served in the first Congress as a friend of Hamilton's measures.\\n\", \"Later he attached himself to Jefferson's fortunes and served for eight\\n\", 'years as his first counselor, the Secretary of State. The principles of\\n', 'the Constitution, which he had helped to make and interpret, he was now\\n', 'as President called upon to apply in one of the most perplexing moments\\n', 'in all American history. In keeping with his own traditions and\\n', 'following in the footsteps of Jefferson, he vainly tried to solve the\\n', 'foreign problem by negotiation.\\n', '\\n', '=The Trend of Events.=--Whatever difficulties Madison had in making up\\n', 'his mind on war and peace were settled by events beyond his own control.\\n', 'In the spring of 1811, a British frigate held up an American ship near\\n', 'the harbor of New York and impressed a seaman alleged to be an American\\n', 'citizen. Burning with resentment, the captain of the _President_, an\\n', 'American warship, acting under orders, poured several broadsides into\\n', 'the _Little Belt_, a British sloop, suspected of being the guilty party.\\n', 'The British also encouraged the Indian chief Tecumseh, who welded\\n', 'together the Indians of the Northwest under British protection and gave\\n', 'signs of restlessness presaging a revolt. This sent a note of alarm\\n', 'along the frontier that was not checked even when, in November,\\n', \"Tecumseh's men were badly beaten at Tippecanoe by William Henry\\n\", 'Harrison. The Indians stood in the way of the advancing frontier, and it\\n', 'seemed to the pioneers that, without support from the British in Canada,\\n', 'the Red Men would soon be subdued.\\n', '\\n', '=Clay and Calhoun.=--While events were moving swiftly and rumors were\\n', 'flying thick and fast, the mastery of the government passed from the\\n', 'uncertain hands of Madison to a party of ardent young men in Congress,\\n', 'dubbed \"Young Republicans,\" under the leadership of two members destined\\n', 'to be mighty figures in American history: Henry Clay of Kentucky and\\n', 'John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. The former contended, in a flair of\\n', 'folly, that \"the militia of Kentucky alone are competent to place\\n', 'Montreal and Upper Canada at your feet.\" The latter with a light heart\\n', 'spoke of conquering Canada in a four weeks\\' campaign. \"It must not be\\n', 'inferred,\" says Channing, \"that in advocating conquest, the Westerners\\n', 'were actuated merely by desire for land; they welcomed war because they\\n', '\\n', 'thought it would be the easiest way to abate Indian troubles. The\\n', 'savages were supported by the fur-trading interests that centred at\\n', 'Quebec and London.... The Southerners on their part wished for Florida\\n', 'and they thought that the conquest of Canada would obviate some Northern\\n', 'opposition to this acquisition of slave territory.\" While Clay and\\n', 'Calhoun, spokesmen of the West and South, were not unmindful of what\\n', 'Napoleon had done to American commerce, they knew that their followers\\n', 'still remembered with deep gratitude the aid of the French in the war\\n', 'for independence and that the embers of the old hatred for George III,\\n', 'still on the throne, could be readily blown into flame.\\n', '\\n', '=Madison Accepts War as Inevitable.=--The conduct of the British\\n', 'ministers with whom Madison had to deal did little to encourage him in\\n', 'adhering to the policy of \"watchful waiting.\" One of them, a high Tory,\\n', 'believed that all Americans were alike \"except that a few are less\\n', 'knaves than others\" and his methods were colored by his belief. On the\\n', 'recall of this minister the British government selected another no less\\n', 'high and mighty in his principles and opinions. So Madison became\\n', 'thoroughly discouraged about the outcome of pacific measures. When the\\n', 'pressure from Congress upon him became too heavy, he gave way, signing\\n', 'on June 18, 1812, the declaration of war on Great Britain. In\\n', 'proclaiming hostilities, the administration set forth the causes which\\n', 'justified the declaration; namely, the British had been encouraging the\\n', 'Indians to attack American citizens on the frontier; they had ruined\\n', 'American trade by blockades; they had insulted the American flag by\\n', 'stopping and searching our ships; they had illegally seized American\\n', 'sailors and driven them into the British navy.\\n', '\\n', '=The Course of the War.=--The war lasted for nearly three years without\\n', 'bringing victory to either side. The surrender of Detroit by General\\n', 'Hull to the British and the failure of the American invasion of Canada\\n', \"were offset by Perry's victory on Lake Erie and a decisive blow\\n\", 'administered to British designs for an invasion of New York by way of\\n', 'Plattsburgh. The triumph of Jackson at New Orleans helped to atone for\\n', 'the humiliation suffered in the burning of the Capitol by the British.\\n', 'The stirring deeds of the _Constitution_, the _United States_, and the\\n', '_Argus_ on the seas, the heroic death of Lawrence and the victories of a\\n', 'hundred privateers furnished consolation for those who suffered from the\\n', 'iron blockade finally established by the British government when it came\\n', 'to appreciate the gravity of the situation. While men love the annals of\\n', 'the sea, they will turn to the running battles, the narrow escapes, and\\n', 'the reckless daring of American sailors in that naval contest with Great\\n', 'Britain.\\n', '\\n', 'All this was exciting but it was inconclusive. In fact, never was a\\n', 'government less prepared than was that of the United States in 1812. It\\n', 'had neither the disciplined troops, the ships of war, nor the supplies\\n', 'required by the magnitude of the military task. It was fortune that\\n', 'favored the American cause. Great Britain, harassed, worn, and\\n', 'financially embarrassed by nearly twenty years of fighting in Europe,\\n', 'was in no mood to gather her forces for a titanic effort in America even\\n', 'after Napoleon was overthrown and sent into exile at Elba in the spring\\n', 'of 1814. War clouds still hung on the European horizon and the conflict\\n', 'temporarily halted did again break out. To be rid of American anxieties\\n', 'and free for European eventualities, England was ready to settle with\\n', 'the United States, especially as that could be done without conceding\\n', 'anything or surrendering any claims.\\n', '\\n', '=The Treaty of Peace.=--Both countries were in truth sick of a war that\\n', 'offered neither glory nor profit. Having indulged in the usual\\n', 'diplomatic skirmishing, they sent representatives to Ghent to discuss\\n', 'terms of peace. After long negotiations an agreement was reached on\\n', \"Christmas eve, 1814, a few days before Jackson's victory at New Orleans.\\n\", 'When the treaty reached America the people were surprised to find that\\n', 'it said nothing about the seizure of American sailors, the destruction\\n', 'of American trade, the searching of American ships, or the support of\\n', 'Indians on the frontier. Nevertheless, we are told, the people \"passed\\n', 'from gloom to glory\" when the news of peace arrived. The bells were\\n', 'rung; schools were closed; flags were displayed; and many a rousing\\n', 'toast was drunk in tavern and private home. The rejoicing could\\n', 'continue. With Napoleon definitely beaten at Waterloo in June, 1815,\\n', 'Great Britain had no need to impress sailors, search ships, and\\n', 'confiscate American goods bound to the Continent. Once more the terrible\\n', 'sea power sank into the background and the ocean was again white with\\n', 'the sails of merchantmen.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE REPUBLICANS NATIONALIZED\\n', '\\n', \"=The Federalists Discredited.=--By a strange turn of fortune's wheel,\\n\", 'the party of Hamilton, Washington, Adams, the party of the grand nation,\\n', 'became the party of provincialism and nullification. New England,\\n', 'finding its shipping interests crippled in the European conflict and\\n', 'then penalized by embargoes, opposed the declaration of war on Great\\n', 'Britain, which meant the completion of the ruin already begun. In the\\n', 'course of the struggle, the Federalist leaders came perilously near to\\n', 'treason in their efforts to hamper the government of the United States;\\n', 'and in their desperation they fell back upon the doctrine of\\n', 'nullification so recently condemned by them when it came from Kentucky.\\n', 'The Senate of Massachusetts, while the war was in progress, resolved\\n', 'that it was waged \"without justifiable cause,\" and refused to approve\\n', 'military and naval projects not connected with \"the defense of our\\n', 'seacoast and soil.\" A Boston newspaper declared that the union was\\n', 'nothing but a treaty among sovereign states, that states could decide\\n', 'for themselves the question of obeying federal law, and that armed\\n', 'resistance under the banner of a state would not be rebellion or\\n', 'treason. The general assembly of Connecticut reminded the administration\\n', 'at Washington that \"the state of Connecticut is a free, sovereign, and\\n', 'independent state.\" Gouverneur Morris, a member of the convention which\\n', 'had drafted the Constitution, suggested the holding of another\\n', 'conference to consider whether the Northern states should remain in the\\n', 'union.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old cartoon_\\n', '\\n', 'NEW ENGLAND JUMPING INTO THE HANDS OF GEORGE III]\\n', '\\n', 'In October, 1814, a convention of delegates from Connecticut,\\n', 'Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and certain counties of New Hampshire and\\n', 'Vermont was held at Hartford, on the call of Massachusetts. The counsels\\n', 'of the extremists were rejected but the convention solemnly went on\\n', 'record to the effect that acts of Congress in violation of the\\n', 'Constitution are void; that in cases of deliberate, dangerous, and\\n', 'palpable infractions the state is duty bound to interpose its authority\\n', 'for the protection of its citizens; and that when emergencies occur the\\n', 'states must be their own judges and execute their own decisions. Thus\\n', 'New England answered the challenge of Calhoun and Clay. Fortunately its\\n', 'actions were not as rash as its words. The Hartford convention merely\\n', 'proposed certain amendments to the Constitution and adjourned. At the\\n', 'close of the war, its proposals vanished harmlessly; but the men who\\n', 'made them were hopelessly discredited.\\n', '\\n', '=The Second United States Bank.=--In driving the Federalists towards\\n', 'nullification and waging a national war themselves, the Republicans lost\\n', 'all their old taint of provincialism. Moreover, in turning to measures\\n', 'of reconstruction called forth by the war, they resorted to the national\\n', 'devices of the Federalists. In 1816, they chartered for a period of\\n', 'twenty years a second United States Bank--the institution which\\n', 'Jefferson and Madison once had condemned as unsound and\\n', 'unconstitutional. The Constitution remained unchanged; times and\\n', 'circumstances had changed. Calhoun dismissed the vexed question of\\n', 'constitutionality with a scant reference to an ancient dispute, while\\n', 'Madison set aside his scruples and signed the bill.\\n', '\\n', '=The Protective Tariff of 1816.=--The Republicans supplemented the Bank\\n', 'by another Federalist measure--a high protective tariff. Clay viewed it\\n', 'as the beginning of his \"American system\" of protection. Calhoun\\n', 'defended it on national principles. For this sudden reversal of policy\\n', 'the young Republicans were taunted by some of their older party\\n', 'colleagues with betraying the \"agricultural interest\" that Jefferson had\\n', 'fostered; but Calhoun refused to listen to their criticisms. \"When the\\n', 'seas are open,\" he said, \"the produce of the South may pour anywhere\\n', 'into the markets of the Old World.... What are the effects of a war with\\n', 'a maritime power--with England? Our commerce annihilated ... our\\n', 'agriculture cut off from its accustomed markets, the surplus of the\\n', 'farmer perishes on his hands.... The recent war fell with peculiar\\n', 'pressure on the growers of cotton and tobacco and the other great\\n', 'staples of the country; and the same state of things will recur in the\\n', 'event of another war unless prevented by the foresight of this body....\\n', 'When our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection, as they soon\\n', 'will be under the fostering care of the government, we shall no longer\\n', 'experience these evils.\" With the Republicans nationalized, the\\n', 'Federalist party, as an organization, disappeared after a crushing\\n', 'defeat in the presidential campaign of 1816.\\n', '\\n', '=Monroe and the Florida Purchase.=--To the victor in that political\\n', 'contest, James Monroe of Virginia, fell two tasks of national\\n', 'importance, adding to the prestige of the whole country and deepening\\n', 'the sense of patriotism that weaned men away from mere allegiance to\\n', 'states. The first of these was the purchase of Florida from Spain. The\\n', 'acquisition of Louisiana let the Mississippi flow \"unvexed to the sea\";\\n', 'but it left all the states east of the river cut off from the Gulf,\\n', 'affording them ground for discontent akin to that which had moved the\\n', 'pioneers of Kentucky to action a generation earlier. The uncertainty as\\n', 'to the boundaries of Louisiana gave the United States a claim to West\\n', 'Florida, setting on foot a movement for occupation. The Florida swamps\\n', 'were a basis for Indian marauders who periodically swept into the\\n', 'frontier settlements, and hiding places for runaway slaves. Thus the\\n', 'sanction of international law was given to punitive expeditions into\\n', 'alien territory.\\n', '\\n', 'The pioneer leaders stood waiting for the signal. It came. President\\n', 'Monroe, on the occasion of an Indian outbreak, ordered General Jackson\\n', 'to seize the offenders, in the Floridas, if necessary. The high-spirited\\n', 'warrior, taking this as a hint that he was to occupy the coveted region,\\n', 'replied that, if possession was the object of the invasion, he could\\n', 'occupy the Floridas within sixty days. Without waiting for an answer to\\n', 'this letter, he launched his expedition, and in the spring of 1818 was\\n', \"master of the Spanish king's domain to the south.\\n\", '\\n', 'There was nothing for the king to do but to make the best of the\\n', 'inevitable by ceding the Floridas to the United States in return for\\n', 'five million dollars to be paid to American citizens having claims\\n', \"against Spain. On Washington's birthday, 1819, the treaty was signed. It\\n\", 'ceded the Floridas to the United States and defined the boundary between\\n', 'Mexico and the United States by drawing a line from the mouth of the\\n', 'Sabine River in a northwesterly direction to the Pacific. On this\\n', 'occasion even Monroe, former opponent of the Constitution, forgot to\\n', 'inquire whether new territory could be constitutionally acquired and\\n', 'incorporated into the American union. The Republicans seemed far away\\n', 'from the days of \"strict construction.\" And Jefferson still lived!\\n', '\\n', '=The Monroe Doctrine.=--Even more effective in fashioning the national\\n', \"idea was Monroe's enunciation of the famous doctrine that bears his\\n\", 'name. The occasion was another European crisis. During the Napoleonic\\n', 'upheaval and the years of dissolution that ensued, the Spanish colonies\\n', 'in America, following the example set by their English neighbors in\\n', '1776, declared their independence. Unable to conquer them alone, the\\n', 'king of Spain turned for help to the friendly powers of Europe that\\n', 'looked upon revolution and republics with undisguised horror.\\n', '\\n', '_The Holy Alliance._--He found them prepared to view his case with\\n', 'sympathy. Three of them, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, under the\\n', 'leadership of the Czar, Alexander I, in the autumn of 1815, had entered\\n', 'into a Holy Alliance to sustain by reciprocal service the autocratic\\n', 'principle in government. Although the effusive, almost maudlin, language\\n', 'of the treaty did not express their purpose explicitly, the Alliance was\\n', 'later regarded as a mere union of monarchs to prevent the rise and\\n', 'growth of popular government.\\n', '\\n', 'The American people thought their worst fears confirmed when, in 1822, a\\n', 'conference of delegates from Russia, Austria, Prussia, and France met at\\n', 'Verona to consider, among other things, revolutions that had just broken\\n', 'out in Spain and Italy. The spirit of the conference is reflected in the\\n', 'first article of the agreement reached by the delegates: \"The high\\n', 'contracting powers, being convinced that the system of representative\\n', 'government is equally incompatible with the monarchical principle and\\n', 'the maxim of the sovereignty of the people with the divine right,\\n', 'mutually engage in the most solemn manner to use all their efforts to\\n', 'put an end to the system of representative government in whatever\\n', 'country it may exist in Europe and to prevent its being introduced in\\n', 'those countries where it is not yet known.\" The Czar, who incidentally\\n', 'coveted the west coast of North America, proposed to send an army to aid\\n', 'the king of Spain in his troubles at home, thus preparing the way for\\n', 'intervention in Spanish America. It was material weakness not want of\\n', 'spirit, that prevented the grand union of monarchs from making open war\\n', 'on popular government.\\n', '\\n', '_The Position of England._--Unfortunately, too, for the Holy Alliance,\\n', 'England refused to cooperate. English merchants had built up a large\\n', 'trade with the independent Latin-American colonies and they protested\\n', 'against the restoration of Spanish sovereignty, which meant a renewal of\\n', \"Spain's former trade monopoly. Moreover, divine right doctrines had been\\n\", 'laid to rest in England and the representative principle thoroughly\\n', 'established. Already there were signs of the coming democratic flood\\n', 'which was soon to carry the first reform bill of 1832, extending the\\n', 'suffrage, and sweep on to even greater achievements. British statesmen,\\n', 'therefore, had to be cautious. In such circumstances, instead of\\n', 'cooperating with the autocrats of Russia, Austria, and Prussia, they\\n', 'turned to the minister of the United States in London. The British prime\\n', 'minister, Canning, proposed that the two countries join in declaring\\n', 'their unwillingness to see the Spanish colonies transferred to any other\\n', 'power.\\n', '\\n', \"_Jefferson's Advice._--The proposal was rejected; but President Monroe\\n\", 'took up the suggestion with Madison and Jefferson as well as with his\\n', 'Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams. They favored the plan. Jefferson\\n', 'said: \"One nation, most of all, could disturb us in this pursuit [of\\n', 'freedom]; she now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us in it. By\\n', 'acceding to her proposition we detach her from the bands, bring her\\n', 'mighty weight into the scale of free government and emancipate a\\n', 'continent at one stroke.... With her on our side we need not fear the\\n', 'whole world. With her then we should most sedulously cherish a cordial\\n', 'friendship.\"\\n', '\\n', \"_Monroe's Statement of the Doctrine._--Acting on the advice of trusted\\n\", 'friends, President Monroe embodied in his message to Congress, on\\n', 'December 2, 1823, a statement of principles now famous throughout the\\n', 'world as the Monroe Doctrine. To the autocrats of Europe he announced\\n', 'that he would regard \"any attempt on their part to extend their system\\n', 'to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety.\"\\n', 'While he did not propose to interfere with existing colonies dependent\\n', 'on European powers, he ranged himself squarely on the side of those that\\n', 'had declared their independence. Any attempt by a European power to\\n', 'oppress them or control their destiny in any manner he characterized as\\n', '\"a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States.\"\\n', 'Referring in another part of his message to a recent claim which the\\n', 'Czar had made to the Pacific coast, President Monroe warned the Old\\n', 'World that \"the American continents, by the free and independent\\n', 'condition which they have assumed and maintained, are henceforth not to\\n', 'be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European\\n', 'powers.\" The effect of this declaration was immediate and profound. Men\\n', 'whose political horizon had been limited to a community or state were\\n', 'led to consider their nation as a great power among the sovereignties of\\n', 'the earth, taking its part in shaping their international relations.\\n', '\\n', '=The Missouri Compromise.=--Respecting one other important measure of\\n', 'this period, the Republicans also took a broad view of their obligations\\n', 'under the Constitution; namely, the Missouri Compromise. It is true,\\n', 'they insisted on the admission of Missouri as a slave state, balanced\\n', 'against the free state of Maine; but at the same time they assented to\\n', 'the prohibition of slavery in the Louisiana territory north of the line\\n', \"36 o 30'. During the debate on the subject an extreme view had been\\n\", 'presented, to the effect that Congress had no constitutional warrant for\\n', 'abolishing slavery in the territories. The precedent of the Northwest\\n', 'Ordinance, ratified by Congress in 1789, seemed a conclusive answer from\\n', 'practice to this contention; but Monroe submitted the issue to his\\n', 'cabinet, which included Calhoun of South Carolina, Crawford of Georgia,\\n', 'and Wirt of Virginia, all presumably adherents to the Jeffersonian\\n', 'principle of strict construction. He received in reply a unanimous\\n', 'verdict to the effect that Congress did have the power to prohibit\\n', 'slavery in the territories governed by it. Acting on this advice he\\n', 'approved, on March 6, 1820, the bill establishing freedom north of the\\n', 'compromise line. This generous interpretation of the powers of Congress\\n', 'stood for nearly forty years, until repudiated by the Supreme Court in\\n', 'the Dred Scott case.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE NATIONAL DECISIONS OF CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL\\n', '\\n', '=John Marshall, the Nationalist.=--The Republicans in the lower ranges\\n', 'of state politics, who did not catch the grand national style of their\\n', 'leaders charged with responsibilities in the national field, were\\n', 'assisted in their education by a Federalist from the Old Dominion, John\\n', 'Marshall, who, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United\\n', 'States from 1801 to 1835, lost no occasion to exalt the Constitution\\n', 'above the claims of the provinces. No differences of opinion as to his\\n', 'political views have ever led even his warmest opponents to deny his\\n', 'superb abilities or his sincere devotion to the national idea. All will\\n', 'likewise agree that for talents, native and acquired, he was an ornament\\n', 'to the humble democracy that brought him forth. His whole career was\\n', 'American.

Later, as a member of Congress, a representative\\n', 'to France, and Secretary of State, he had aided the Federalists in\\n', 'establishing the new government. When at length they were driven from\\n', 'power in the executive and legislative branches of the government, he\\n', 'was chosen for their last stronghold, the Supreme Court. By historic\\n', 'irony he administered the oath of office to his bitterest enemy, Thomas\\n', 'Jefferson; and, long after the author of the Declaration of Independence\\n', 'had retired to private life, the stern Chief Justice continued to\\n', 'announce the old Federalist principles from the Supreme Bench.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: JOHN MARSHALL]\\n', '\\n', '=Marbury _vs._ Madison--An Act of Congress Annulled.=--He had been in\\n', 'his high office only two years when he laid down for the first time in\\n', 'the name of the entire Court the doctrine that the judges have the power\\n', 'to declare an act of Congress null and void when in their opinion it\\n', 'violates the Constitution.

Though many able men held that the judicial branch of the\\n', 'government enjoyed it, the principle was not positively established\\n', 'until 1803 when the case of Marbury _vs._ Madison was decided. In\\n', 'rendering the opinion of the Court, Marshall cited no precedents. He\\n', 'sought no foundations for his argument in ancient history. He rested it\\n', 'on the general nature of the American system. The Constitution, ran his\\n', 'reasoning, is the supreme law of the land; it limits and binds all who\\n', 'act in the name of the United States; it limits the powers of Congress\\n', 'and defines the rights of citizens. If Congress can ignore its\\n', 'limitations and trespass upon the rights of citizens, Marshall argued,\\n', 'then the Constitution disappears and Congress is supreme. Since,\\n', 'however, the Constitution is supreme and superior to Congress, it is the\\n', 'duty of judges, under their oath of office, to sustain it against\\n', 'measures which violate it. Therefore, from the nature of the American\\n', 'constitutional system the courts must declare null and void all acts\\n', 'which are not authorized. \"A law repugnant to the Constitution,\" he\\n', 'closed, \"is void and the courts as well as other departments are bound\\n', 'by that instrument.\" From that day to this the practice of federal and\\n', 'state courts in passing upon the constitutionality of laws has remained\\n', 'unshaken.\\n', '\\n', 'This doctrine was received by Jefferson and many of his followers with\\n', 'consternation. If the idea was sound, he exclaimed, \"then indeed is our\\n', 'Constitution a complete _felo de se_ [legally, a suicide]. For,\\n', 'intending to establish three departments, coordinate and independent\\n', 'that they might check and balance one another, it has given, according\\n', 'to this opinion, to one of them alone the right to prescribe rules for\\n', 'the government of the others, and to that one, too, which is unelected\\n', 'by and independent of the nation.... The Constitution, on this\\n', 'hypothesis, is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary which\\n', 'they may twist and shape into any form they please. It should be\\n', 'remembered, as an axiom of eternal truth in politics, that whatever\\n', 'power in any government is independent, is absolute also.... A judiciary\\n', 'independent of a king or executive alone is a good thing; but\\n', 'independence of the will of the nation is a solecism, at least in a\\n', 'republican government.\" But Marshall was mighty and his view prevailed,\\n', \"though from time to time other men, clinging to Jefferson's opinion,\\n\", 'likewise opposed the exercise by the Courts of the high power of passing\\n', 'upon the constitutionality of acts of Congress.\\n', '\\n', '=Acts of State Legislatures Declared Unconstitutional.=--Had Marshall\\n', 'stopped with annulling an act of Congress, he would have heard less\\n', 'criticism from Republican quarters; but, with the same firmness, he set\\n', 'aside acts of state legislatures as well, whenever, in his opinion, they\\n', 'violated the federal Constitution. In 1810, in the case of Fletcher\\n', '_vs._ Peck, he annulled an act of the Georgia legislature, informing the\\n', 'state that it was not sovereign, but \"a part of a large empire, ... a\\n', 'member of the American union; and that union has a constitution ...\\n', 'which imposes limits to the legislatures of the several states.\" In the\\n', 'case of McCulloch _vs._ Maryland, decided in 1819, he declared void an\\n', 'act of the Maryland legislature designed to paralyze the branches of the\\n', 'United States Bank established in that state. In the same year, in the\\n', 'still more memorable Dartmouth College case, he annulled an act of the\\n', 'New Hampshire legislature which infringed upon the charter received by\\n', 'the college from King George long before. That charter, he declared, was\\n', 'a contract between the state and the college, which the legislature\\n', 'under the federal Constitution could not impair. Two years later he\\n', 'stirred the wrath of Virginia by summoning her to the bar of the Supreme\\n', 'Court to answer in a case in which the validity of one of her laws was\\n', 'involved and then justified his action in a powerful opinion rendered in\\n', 'the case of Cohens _vs._ Virginia.\\n', '\\n', 'All these decisions aroused the legislatures of the states. They passed\\n', 'sheaves of resolutions protesting and condemning; but Marshall never\\n', 'turned and never stayed. The Constitution of the United States, he\\n', 'fairly thundered at them, is the supreme law of the land; the Supreme\\n', 'Court is the proper tribunal to pass finally upon the validity of the\\n', 'laws of the states; and \"those sovereignties,\" far from possessing the\\n', 'right of review and nullification, are irrevocably bound by the\\n', 'decisions of that Court. This was strong medicine for the authors of the\\n', 'Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions and for the members of the Hartford\\n', 'convention; but they had to take it.\\n', '\\n', '=The Doctrine of Implied Powers.=--While restraining Congress in the\\n', 'Marbury case and the state legislatures in a score of cases, Marshall\\n', 'also laid the judicial foundation for a broad and liberal view of the\\n', 'Constitution as opposed to narrow and strict construction. In McCulloch\\n', '_vs._ Maryland, he construed generously the words \"necessary and proper\"\\n', 'in such a way as to confer upon Congress a wide range of \"implied\\n', 'powers\" in addition to their express powers. That case involved, among\\n', 'other things, the question whether the act establishing the second\\n', 'United States Bank was authorized by the Constitution. Marshall answered\\n', 'in the affirmative. Congress, ran his reasoning, has large powers over\\n', 'taxation and the currency; a bank is of appropriate use in the exercise\\n', 'of these enumerated powers; and therefore, though not absolutely\\n', 'necessary, a bank is entirely proper and constitutional. \"With respect\\n', 'to the means by which the powers that the Constitution confers are to be\\n', 'carried into execution,\" he said, Congress must be allowed the\\n', 'discretion which \"will enable that body to perform the high duties\\n', 'assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people.\" In short,\\n', 'the Constitution of the United States is not a strait jacket but a\\n', 'flexible instrument vesting in Congress the powers necessary to meet\\n', 'national problems as they arise. In delivering this opinion Marshall\\n', 'used language almost identical with that employed by Lincoln when,\\n', 'standing on the battle field of a war waged to preserve the nation, he\\n', 'said that \"a government of the people, by the people, for the people\\n', 'shall not perish from the earth.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SUMMARY OF THE UNION AND NATIONAL POLITICS\\n', '\\n', 'During the strenuous period between the establishment of American\\n', 'independence and the advent of Jacksonian democracy the great American\\n', 'experiment was under the direction of the men who had launched it. All\\n', 'the Presidents in that period, except John Quincy Adams, had taken part\\n', 'in the Revolution. James Madison, the chief author of the Constitution,\\n', 'lived until 1836. This age, therefore, was the \"age of the fathers.\" It\\n', 'saw the threatened ruin of the country under the Articles of\\n', 'Confederation, the formation of the Constitution, the rise of political\\n', 'parties, the growth of the West, the second war with England, and the\\n', 'apparent triumph of the national spirit over sectionalism.\\n', '\\n', 'The new republic had hardly been started in 1783 before its troubles\\n', 'began. The government could not raise money to pay its debts or running\\n', 'expenses; it could not protect American commerce and manufactures\\n', 'against European competition; it could not stop the continual issues of\\n', 'paper money by the states; it could not intervene to put down domestic\\n', 'uprisings that threatened the existence of the state governments.\\n', 'Without money, without an army, without courts of law, the union under\\n', 'the Articles of Confederation was drifting into dissolution. Patriots,\\n', 'who had risked their lives for independence, began to talk of monarchy\\n', 'again. Washington, Hamilton, and Madison insisted that a new\\n', 'constitution alone could save America from disaster.\\n', '\\n', 'By dint of much labor the friends of a new form of government induced\\n', 'the Congress to call a national convention to take into account the\\n', 'state of America. In May, 1787, it assembled at Philadelphia and for\\n', 'months it debated and wrangled over plans for a constitution. The small\\n', 'states clamored for equal rights in the union. The large states vowed\\n', 'that they would never grant it. A spirit of conciliation, fair play, and\\n', 'compromise saved the convention from breaking up. In addition, there\\n', 'were jealousies between the planting states and the commercial states.\\n', 'Here, too, compromises had to be worked out. Some of the delegates\\n', 'feared the growth of democracy and others cherished it. These factions\\n', 'also had to be placated. At last a plan of government was drafted--the\\n', 'Constitution of the United States--and submitted to the states for\\n', 'approval. Only after a long and acrimonious debate did enough states\\n', 'ratify the instrument to put it into effect. On April 30, 1789, George\\n', 'Washington was inaugurated first President.\\n', '\\n', 'The new government proceeded to fund the old debt of the nation, assume\\n', 'the debts of the states, found a national bank, lay heavy taxes to pay\\n', 'the bills, and enact laws protecting American industry and commerce.\\n', 'Hamilton led the way, but he had not gone far before he encountered\\n', 'opposition. He found a formidable antagonist in Jefferson. In time two\\n', 'political parties appeared full armed upon the scene: the Federalists\\n', 'and the Republicans. For ten years they filled the country with\\n', 'political debate. In 1800 the Federalists were utterly vanquished by the\\n', 'Republicans with Jefferson in the lead.\\n', '\\n', 'By their proclamations of faith the Republicans favored the states\\n', 'rather than the new national government, but in practice they added\\n', 'immensely to the prestige and power of the nation. They purchased\\n', 'Louisiana from France, they waged a war for commercial independence\\n', 'against England, they created a second United States Bank, they enacted\\n', 'the protective tariff of 1816, they declared that Congress had power to\\n', 'abolish slavery north of the Missouri Compromise line, and they spread\\n', 'the shield of the Monroe Doctrine between the Western Hemisphere and\\n', 'Europe.\\n', '\\n', 'Still America was a part of European civilization. Currents of opinion\\n', 'flowed to and fro across the Atlantic. Friends of popular government in\\n', 'Europe looked to America as the great exemplar of their ideals. Events\\n', 'in Europe reacted upon thought in the United States. The French\\n', 'Revolution exerted a profound influence on the course of political\\n', 'debate. While it was in the stage of mere reform all Americans favored\\n', 'it. When the king was executed and a radical democracy set up, American\\n', 'opinion was divided. When France fell under the military dominion of\\n', 'Napoleon and preyed upon American commerce, the United States made ready\\n', 'for war.\\n', '\\n', 'The conduct of England likewise affected American affairs. In 1793 war\\n', 'broke out between England and France and raged with only a slight\\n', 'intermission until 1815. England and France both ravaged American\\n', 'commerce, but England was the more serious offender because she had\\n', 'command of the seas.

It was the members of the western vanguard, like Daniel\\n', 'Boone, John Sevier, and George Rogers Clark, who first understood the\\n', 'value of the far-away country under the guns of the English forts, where\\n', 'the Red Men still wielded the tomahawk and the scalping knife. It was\\n', 'they who gave the East no rest until their vision was seen by the\\n', 'leaders on the seaboard who directed the course of national policy.

In the first place, tribes of resentful Indians in the\\n', 'Ohio region, even though British support was withdrawn at last, had to\\n', 'be reckoned with; and it was not until after the establishment of the\\n', 'federal Constitution that a well-equipped army could be provided to\\n', 'guarantee peace on the border. In the second place, British garrisons\\n', 'still occupied forts on Lake Erie pending the execution of the terms of\\n', 'the treaty of 1783--terms which were not fulfilled until after the\\n', 'ratification of the Jay treaty twelve years later. In the third place,\\n', 'Virginia, Connecticut, and Massachusetts had conflicting claims to the\\n', 'land in the Northwest based on old English charters and Indian treaties.\\n', 'It was only after a bitter contest that the states reached an agreement\\n', 'to transfer their rights to the government of the United States,\\n', 'Virginia executing her deed of cession on March 1, 1784. In the fourth\\n', 'place, titles to lands bought by individuals remained uncertain in the\\n', 'absence of official maps and records. To meet this last situation,\\n', 'Congress instituted a systematic survey of the Ohio country, laying it\\n', 'out into townships, sections of 640 acres each, and quarter sections. In\\n', 'every township one section of land was set aside for the support of\\n', 'public schools.\\n', '\\n', '=The Northwest Ordinance.=--The final problem which had to be solved\\n', 'before settlement on a large scale could be begun was that of governing\\n', 'the territory. Pioneers who looked with hungry eyes on the fertile\\n', 'valley of the Ohio could hardly restrain their impatience. Soldiers of\\n', 'the Revolution, who had been paid for their services in land warrants\\n', 'entitling them to make entries in the West, called for action.\\n', '\\n', 'Congress answered by passing in 1787 the famous Northwest Ordinance\\n', 'providing for temporary territorial government to be followed by the\\n', 'creation of a popular assembly as soon as there were five thousand free\\n', 'males in any district. Eventual admission to the union on an equal\\n', 'footing with the original states was promised to the new territories.\\n', 'Religious freedom was guaranteed. The safeguards of trial by jury,\\n', 'regular judicial procedure, and _habeas corpus_ were established, in order\\n', 'that the methods of civilized life might take the place of the\\n', 'rough-and-ready justice of lynch law. During the course of the debate on\\n', 'the Ordinance, Congress added the sixth article forbidding slavery and\\n', 'involuntary servitude.\\n', '\\n', 'This Charter of the Northwest, so well planned by the Congress under the\\n', 'Articles of Confederation, was continued in force by the first Congress\\n', 'under the Constitution in 1789. The following year its essential\\n', 'provisions, except the ban on slavery, were applied to the territory\\n', 'south of the Ohio, ceded by North Carolina to the national government,\\n', 'and in 1798 to the Mississippi territory, once held by Georgia. Thus it\\n', 'was settled for all time that \"the new colonies were not to be exploited\\n', 'for the benefit of the parent states (any more than for the benefit of\\n', 'England) but were to be autonomous and coordinate commonwealths.\" This\\n', 'outcome, bitterly opposed by some Eastern leaders who feared the triumph\\n', 'of Western states over the seaboard, completed the legal steps necessary\\n', 'by way of preparation for the flood of settlers.\\n', '\\n', '=The Land Companies, Speculators, and Western Land Tenure.=--As in the\\n', 'original settlement of America, so in the opening of the West, great\\n', 'companies and single proprietors of large grants early figured. In 1787\\n', 'the Ohio Land Company, a New England concern, acquired a million and a\\n', 'half acres on the Ohio and began operations by planting the town of\\n', 'Marietta. A professional land speculator, J.C. Symmes, secured a million\\n', 'acres lower down where the city of Cincinnati was founded. Other\\n', \"individuals bought up soldiers' claims and so acquired enormous holdings\\n\", 'for speculative purposes. Indeed, there was such a rush to make fortunes\\n', 'quickly through the rise in land values that Washington was moved to cry\\n', 'out against the \"rage for speculating in and forestalling of land on the\\n', 'North West of the Ohio,\" protesting that \"scarce a valuable spot within\\n', 'any tolerable distance of it is left without a claimant.\" He therefore\\n', 'urged Congress to fix a reasonable price for the land, not \"too\\n', 'exorbitant and burdensome for real occupiers, but high enough to\\n', 'discourage monopolizers.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Congress, however, was not prepared to use the public domain for the\\n', 'sole purpose of developing a body of small freeholders in the West. It\\n', 'still looked upon the sale of public lands as an important source of\\n', 'revenue with which to pay off the public debt; consequently it thought\\n', 'more of instant income than of ultimate results. It placed no limit on\\n', 'the amount which could be bought when it fixed the price at $2 an acre\\n', 'in 1796, and it encouraged the professional land operator by making the\\n', 'first installment only twenty cents an acre in addition to the small\\n', 'registration and survey fee. On such terms a speculator with a few\\n', 'thousand dollars could get possession of an enormous plot of land. If he\\n', 'was fortunate in disposing of it, he could meet the installments, which\\n', 'were spread over a period of four years, and make a handsome profit for\\n', 'himself. Even when the credit or installment feature was abolished in\\n', '1821 and the price of the land lowered to a cash price of $1.75 an acre,\\n', 'the opportunity for large speculative purchases continued to attract\\n', 'capital to land ventures.\\n', '\\n', '=The Development of the Small Freehold.=--The cheapness of land and the\\n', 'scarcity of labor, nevertheless, made impossible the triumph of the huge\\n', 'estate with its semi-servile tenantry. For about $45 a man could get a\\n', 'farm of 160 acres on the installment plan; another payment of $80 was\\n', 'due in forty days; but a four-year term was allowed for the discharge of\\n', 'the balance. With a capital of from two to three hundred dollars a\\n', 'family could embark on a land venture. If it had good crops, it could\\n', 'meet the deferred payments. It was, however, a hard battle at best. Many\\n', 'a man forfeited his land through failure to pay the final installment;\\n', 'yet in the end, in spite of all the handicaps, the small freehold of a\\n', 'few hundred acres at most became the typical unit of Western\\n', 'agriculture, except in the planting states of the Gulf. Even the lands\\n', 'of the great companies were generally broken up and sold in small lots.\\n', '\\n', 'The tendency toward moderate holdings, so favored by Western conditions,\\n', 'was also promoted by a clause in the Northwest Ordinance declaring that\\n', 'the land of any person dying intestate--that is, without any will\\n', 'disposing of it--should be divided equally among his descendants.\\n', 'Hildreth says of this provision: \"It established the important\\n', 'republican principle, not then introduced into all the states, of the\\n', 'equal distribution of landed as well as personal property.\" All these\\n', 'forces combined made the wide dispersion of wealth, in the early days of\\n', 'the nineteenth century, an American characteristic, in marked contrast\\n', 'with the European system of family prestige and vast estates based on\\n', 'the law of primogeniture.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE WESTERN MIGRATION AND NEW STATES\\n', '\\n', '=The People.=--With government established, federal arms victorious over\\n', 'the Indians, and the lands surveyed for sale, the way was prepared for\\n', 'the immigrants. They came with a rush. Young New Englanders, weary of\\n', 'tilling the stony soil of their native states, poured through New York\\n', 'and Pennsylvania, some settling on the northern bank of the Ohio but\\n', 'most of them in the Lake region. Sons and daughters of German farmers in\\n', 'Pennsylvania and many a redemptioner who had discharged his bond of\\n', 'servitude pressed out into Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, or beyond. From\\n', 'the exhausted fields and the clay hills of the Southern states came\\n', 'pioneers of English and Scotch-Irish descent, the latter in great\\n', 'numbers. Indeed one historian of high authority has ventured to say that\\n', '\"the rapid expansion of the United States from a coast strip to a\\n', 'continental area is largely a Scotch-Irish achievement.\" While native\\n', 'Americans of mixed stocks led the way into the West, it was not long\\n', 'before immigrants direct from Europe, under the stimulus of company\\n', 'enterprise, began to filter into the new settlements in increasing\\n', 'numbers.\\n', '\\n', 'The types of people were as various as the nations they represented.\\n', 'Timothy Flint, who published his entertaining _Recollections_ in 1826,\\n', 'found the West a strange mixture of all sorts and conditions of people.\\n', 'Some of them, he relates, had been hunters in the upper world of the\\n', 'Mississippi, above the falls of St. Anthony. Some had been still farther\\n', 'north, in Canada. Still others had wandered from the South--the Gulf of\\n', 'Mexico, the Red River, and the Spanish country. French boatmen and\\n', 'trappers, Spanish traders from the Southwest, Virginia planters with\\n', 'their droves of slaves mingled with English, German, and Scotch-Irish\\n', 'farmers. Hunters, forest rangers, restless bordermen, and squatters,\\n', 'like the foaming combers of an advancing tide, went first. Then followed\\n', 'the farmers, masters of the ax and plow, with their wives who shared\\n', 'every burden and hardship and introduced some of the features of\\n', 'civilized life. The hunters and rangers passed on to new scenes; the\\n', 'home makers built for all time.\\n', '\\n', '=The Number of Immigrants.=--There were no official stations on the\\n', 'frontier to record the number of immigrants who entered the West during\\n', 'the decades following the American Revolution. But travelers of the time\\n', 'record that every road was \"crowded\" with pioneers and their families,\\n', 'their wagons and cattle; and that they were seldom out of the sound of\\n', 'the snapping whip of the teamster urging forward his horses or the crack\\n', 'of the hunter\\'s rifle as he brought down his evening meal. \"During the\\n', 'latter half of 1787,\" says Coman, \"more than nine hundred boats floated\\n', 'down the Ohio carrying eighteen thousand men, women, and children, and\\n', 'twelve thousand horses, sheep, and cattle, and six hundred and fifty\\n', 'wagons.\" Other lines of travel were also crowded and with the passing\\n', 'years the flooding tide of home seekers rose higher and higher.\\n', '\\n', '=The Western Routes.=--Four main routes led into the country beyond the\\n', 'Appalachians. The Genesee road, beginning at Albany, ran almost due west\\n', 'to the present site of Buffalo on Lake Erie, through a level country. In\\n', 'the dry season, wagons laden with goods could easily pass along it into\\n', 'northern Ohio. A second route, through Pittsburgh, was fed by three\\n', 'eastern branches, one starting at Philadelphia, one at Baltimore, and\\n', 'another at Alexandria. A third main route wound through the mountains\\n', 'from Alexandria to Boonesboro in Kentucky and then westward across the\\n', 'Ohio to St. Louis. A fourth, the most famous of them all, passed through\\n', 'the Cumberland Gap and by branches extended into the Cumberland valley\\n', 'and the Kentucky country.\\n', '\\n', 'Of these four lines of travel, the Pittsburgh route offered the most\\n', 'advantages. Pioneers, no matter from what section they came, when once\\n', 'they were on the headwaters of the Ohio and in possession of a flatboat,\\n', 'could find a quick and easy passage into all parts of the West and\\n', 'Southwest. Whether they wanted to settle in Ohio, Kentucky, or western\\n', 'Tennessee they could find their way down the drifting flood to their\\n', 'destination or at least to some spot near it. Many people from the South\\n', 'as well as the Northern and Middle states chose this route; so it came\\n', 'about that the sons and daughters of Virginia and the Carolinas mingled\\n', 'with those of New York, Pennsylvania, and New England in the settlement\\n', 'of the Northwest territory.\\n', '\\n', '=The Methods of Travel into the West.=--Many stories giving exact\\n', 'descriptions of methods of travel into the West in the early days have\\n', 'been preserved. The country was hardly opened before visitors from the\\n', 'Old World and from the Eastern states, impelled by curiosity, made their\\n', 'way to the very frontier of civilization and wrote books to inform or\\n', 'amuse the public. One of them, Gilbert Imlay, an English traveler, has\\n', 'given us an account of the Pittsburgh route as he found it in 1791. \"If\\n', 'a man ... \" he writes, \"has a family or goods of any sort to remove, his\\n', 'best way, then, would be to purchase a waggon and team of horses to\\n', 'carry his property to Redstone Old Fort or to Pittsburgh, according as\\n', 'he may come from the Northern or Southern states. A good waggon will\\n', 'cost, at Philadelphia, about $10 ... and the horses about $12 each; they\\n', 'would cost something more both at Baltimore and Alexandria. The waggon\\n', 'may be covered with canvass, and if it is the choice of the people, they\\n', 'may sleep in it of nights with the greatest safety. But if they dislike\\n', 'that, there are inns of accommodation the whole distance on the\\n', 'different roads.... The provisions I would purchase in the same manner\\n', '[that is, from the farmers along the road]; and by having two or three\\n', 'camp kettles and stopping every evening when the weather is fine upon\\n', 'the brink of some rivulet and by kindling a fire they may soon dress\\n', 'their own food.... This manner of journeying is so far from being\\n', 'disagreeable that in a fine season it is extremely pleasant.\" The\\n', 'immigrant once at Pittsburgh or Wheeling could then buy a flatboat of a\\n', 'size required for his goods and stock, and drift down the current to his\\n', \"journey's end.\\n\", '\\n', '[Illustration: ROADS AND TRAILS INTO THE WESTERN TERRITORY]\\n', '\\n', '=The Admission of Kentucky and Tennessee.=--When the eighteenth century\\n', 'drew to a close, Kentucky had a population larger than Delaware, Rhode\\n', 'Island, or New Hampshire. Tennessee claimed 60,000 inhabitants. In 1792\\n', 'Kentucky took her place as a state beside her none too kindly parent,\\n', 'Virginia. The Eastern Federalists resented her intrusion; but they took\\n', 'some consolation in the admission of Vermont because the balance of\\n', 'Eastern power was still retained.\\n', '\\n', 'As if to assert their independence of old homes and conservative ideas\\n', \"the makers of Kentucky's first constitution swept aside the landed\\n\", 'qualification on the suffrage and gave the vote to all free white males.\\n', \"Four years later, Kentucky's neighbor to the south, Tennessee, followed\\n\", 'this step toward a wider democracy.

The little posts founded at Marietta and Cincinnati had grown into\\n', 'flourishing centers of trade. The stream of immigrants, flowing down the\\n', 'river, added daily to their numbers and the growing settlements all\\n', 'around poured produce into their markets to be exchanged for \"store\\n', 'goods.\" After the Indians were disposed of in 1794 and the last British\\n', 'soldier left the frontier forts under the terms of the Jay treaty of\\n', '1795, tiny settlements of families appeared on Lake Erie in the \"Western\\n', 'Reserve,\" a region that had been retained by Connecticut when she\\n', 'surrendered her other rights in the Northwest.\\n', '\\n', 'At the close of the century, Ohio, claiming a population of more than\\n', '50,000, grew discontented with its territorial status. Indeed, two years\\n', 'before the enactment of the Northwest Ordinance, squatters in that\\n', 'region had been invited by one John Emerson to hold a convention after\\n', 'the fashion of the men of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield in old\\n', 'Connecticut and draft a frame of government for themselves. This true\\n', 'son of New England declared that men \"have an undoubted right to pass\\n', 'into every vacant country and there to form their constitution and that\\n', 'from the confederation of the whole United States Congress is not\\n', 'empowered to forbid them.\" This grand convention was never held because\\n', 'the heavy hand of the government fell upon the leaders; but the spirit\\n', 'of John Emerson did not perish. In November, 1802, a convention chosen\\n', 'by voters, assembled under the authority of Congress at Chillicothe,\\n', 'drew up a constitution. It went into force after a popular ratification.\\n', 'The roll of the convention bore such names as Abbot, Baldwin, Cutler,\\n', 'Huntington, Putnam, and Sargent, and the list of counties from which\\n', 'they came included Adams, Fairfield, Hamilton, Jefferson, Trumbull, and\\n', 'Washington, showing that the new America in the West was peopled and led\\n', 'by the old stock. In 1803 Ohio was admitted to the union.\\n', '\\n', '=Indiana and Illinois.=--As in the neighboring state, the frontier in\\n', 'Indiana advanced northward from the Ohio, mainly under the leadership,\\n', 'however, of settlers from the South--restless Kentuckians hoping for\\n', 'better luck in a newer country and pioneers from the far frontiers of\\n', 'Virginia and North Carolina. As soon as a tier of counties swinging\\n', 'upward like the horns of the moon against Ohio on the east and in the\\n', 'Wabash Valley on the west was fairly settled, a clamor went up for\\n', 'statehood. Under the authority of an act of Congress in 1816 the\\n', 'Indianians drafted a constitution and inaugurated their government at\\n', 'Corydon. \"The majority of the members of the convention,\" we are told by\\n', 'a local historian, \"were frontier farmers who had a general idea of what\\n', 'they wanted and had sense enough to let their more erudite colleagues\\n', 'put it into shape.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Two years later, the pioneers of Illinois, also settled upward from the\\n', 'Ohio, like Indiana, elected their delegates to draft a constitution.\\n', 'Leadership in the convention, quite properly, was taken by a man born in\\n', 'New York and reared in Tennessee; and the constitution as finally\\n', 'drafted \"was in its principal provisions a copy of the then existing\\n', 'constitutions of Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana.... Many of the articles\\n', 'are exact copies in wording although differently arranged and\\n', 'numbered.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.=--Across the Mississippi to the\\n', 'far south, clearing and planting had gone on with much bustle and\\n', 'enterprise. The cotton and sugar lands of Louisiana, opened by French\\n', 'and Spanish settlers, were widened in every direction by planters with\\n', 'their armies of slaves from the older states. New Orleans, a good market\\n', 'and a center of culture not despised even by the pioneer, grew apace. In\\n', '1810 the population of lower Louisiana was over 75,000. The time had\\n', 'come, said the leaders of the people, to fulfill the promise made to\\n', 'France in the treaty of cession; namely, to grant to the inhabitants of\\n', 'the territory statehood and the rights of American citizens. Federalists\\n', 'from New England still having a voice in Congress, if somewhat weaker,\\n', 'still protested in tones of horror. \"I am compelled to declare it as my\\n', 'deliberate opinion,\" pronounced Josiah Quincy in the House of\\n', 'Representatives, \"that if this bill [to admit Louisiana] passes, the\\n', 'bonds of this Union are virtually dissolved ... that as it will be the\\n', 'right of all, so it will be the duty of some [states] to prepare\\n', 'definitely for a separation; amicably if they can, violently if they\\n', 'must.... It is a death blow to the Constitution. It may afterwards\\n', 'linger; but lingering, its fate will, at no very distant period, be\\n', 'consummated.\" Federalists from New York like those from New England had\\n', 'their doubts about the wisdom of admitting Western states; but the party\\n', 'of Jefferson and Madison, having the necessary majority, granted the\\n', 'coveted statehood to Louisiana in 1812.\\n', '\\n', 'When, a few years later, Mississippi and Alabama knocked at the doors of\\n', 'the union, the Federalists had so little influence, on account of their\\n', 'conduct during the second war with England, that spokesmen from the\\n', 'Southwest met a kindlier reception at Washington. Mississippi, in 1817,\\n', 'and Alabama, in 1819, took their places among the United States of\\n', 'America. Both of them, while granting white manhood suffrage, gave their\\n', 'constitutions the tone of the old East by providing landed\\n', 'qualifications for the governor and members of the legislature.\\n', '\\n', '=Missouri.=--Far to the north in the Louisiana purchase, a new\\n', 'commonwealth was rising to power. It was peopled by immigrants who came\\n', 'down the Ohio in fleets of boats or crossed the Mississippi from\\n', 'Kentucky and Tennessee. Thrifty Germans from Pennsylvania, hardy farmers\\n', 'from Virginia ready to work with their own hands, freemen seeking\\n', \"freemen's homes, planters with their slaves moving on from worn-out\\n\", 'fields on the seaboard, came together in the widening settlements of the\\n', 'Missouri country. Peoples from the North and South flowed together,\\n', 'small farmers and big planters mingling in one community. When their\\n', 'numbers had reached sixty thousand or more, they precipitated a contest\\n', 'over their admission to the union, \"ringing an alarm bell in the night,\"\\n', 'as Jefferson phrased it. The favorite expedient of compromise with\\n', 'slavery was brought forth in Congress once more. Maine consequently was\\n', 'brought into the union without slavery and Missouri with slavery. At the\\n', 'same time there was drawn westward through the rest of the Louisiana\\n', 'territory a line separating servitude from slavery.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE SPIRIT OF THE FRONTIER\\n', '\\n', '=Land Tenure and Liberty.=--Over an immense western area there developed\\n', 'an unbroken system of freehold farms. In the Gulf states and the lower\\n', 'Mississippi Valley, it is true, the planter with his many slaves even\\n', 'led in the pioneer movement; but through large sections of Tennessee and\\n', 'Kentucky, as well as upper Georgia and Alabama, and all throughout the\\n', 'Northwest territory the small farmer reigned supreme. In this immense\\n', 'dominion there sprang up a civilization without caste or class--a body\\n', \"of people all having about the same amount of this world's goods and\\n\", 'deriving their livelihood from one source: the labor of their own hands\\n', 'on the soil. The Northwest territory alone almost equaled in area all\\n', 'the original thirteen states combined, except Georgia, and its system of\\n', 'agricultural economy was unbroken by plantations and feudal estates. \"In\\n', 'the subdivision of the soil and the great equality of condition,\" as\\n', 'Webster said on more than one occasion, \"lay the true basis, most\\n', 'certainly, of popular government.\" There was the undoubted source of\\n', 'Jacksonian democracy.\\n', '\\n', \"[Illustration: A LOG CABIN--LINCOLN'S BIRTHPLACE]\\n\", '\\n', '=The Characteristics of the Western People.=--Travelers into the\\n', 'Northwest during the early years of the nineteenth century were agreed\\n', 'that the people of that region were almost uniformly marked by the\\n', 'characteristics common to an independent yeomanry. A close observer thus\\n', 'recorded his impressions: \"A spirit of adventurous enterprise, a\\n', 'willingness to go through any hardship to accomplish an object....\\n', 'Independence of thought and action. They have felt the influence of\\n', 'these principles from their childhood. Men who can endure anything; that\\n', 'have lived almost without restraint, free as the mountain air or as the\\n', 'deer and the buffalo of their forests, and who know they are Americans\\n', 'all.... An apparent roughness which some would deem rudeness of\\n', 'manner.... Where there is perfect equality in a neighborhood of people\\n', \"who know little about each other's previous history or ancestry but\\n\", 'where each is lord of the soil he cultivates. Where a log cabin is all\\n', 'that the best of families can expect to have for years and of course can\\n', 'possess few of the external decorations which have so much influence in\\n', 'creating a diversity of rank in society. These circumstances have laid\\n', 'the foundation for that equality of intercourse, simplicity of manners,\\n', 'want of deference, want of reserve, great readiness to make\\n', 'acquaintances, freedom of speech, indisposition to brook real or\\n', 'imaginary insults which one witnesses among people of the West.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This equality, this independence, this rudeness so often described by\\n', 'the traveler as marking a new country, were all accentuated by the\\n', 'character of the settlers themselves. Traces of the fierce, unsociable,\\n', 'eagle-eyed, hard-drinking hunter remained. The settlers who followed the\\n', 'hunter were, with some exceptions, soldiers of the Revolutionary army,\\n', 'farmers of the \"middling order,\" and mechanics from the towns,--English,\\n', 'Scotch-Irish, Germans,--poor in possessions and thrown upon the labor of\\n', 'their own hands for support. Sons and daughters from well-to-do Eastern\\n', 'homes sometimes brought softer manners; but the equality of life and the\\n', 'leveling force of labor in forest and field soon made them one in spirit\\n', 'with their struggling neighbors. Even the preachers and teachers, who\\n', 'came when the cabins were raised in the clearings and rude churches and\\n', 'schoolhouses were built, preached sermons and taught lessons that\\n', 'savored of the frontier, as any one may know who reads Peter\\n', \"Cartwright's _A Muscular Christian_ or Eggleston's _The Hoosier\\n\", 'Schoolmaster_.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE WEST AND THE EAST MEET\\n', '\\n', '=The East Alarmed.=--A people so independent as the Westerners and so\\n', 'attached to local self-government gave the conservative East many a rude\\n', 'shock, setting gentlemen in powdered wigs and knee breeches agog with\\n', 'the idea that terrible things might happen in the Mississippi Valley.\\n', 'Not without good grounds did Washington fear that \"a touch of a feather\\n', 'would turn\" the Western settlers away from the seaboard to the\\n', 'Spaniards; and seriously did he urge the East not to neglect them, lest\\n', 'they be \"drawn into the arms of, or be dependent upon foreigners.\"\\n', 'Taking advantage of the restless spirit in the Southwest, Aaron Burr,\\n', 'having disgraced himself by killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel, laid\\n', 'wild plans, if not to bring about a secession in that region, at least\\n', 'to build a state of some kind out of the Spanish dominions adjoining\\n', 'Louisiana. Frightened at such enterprises and fearing the dominance of\\n', 'the West, the Federalists, with a few conspicuous exceptions, opposed\\n', 'equality between the sections. Had their narrow views prevailed, the\\n', 'West, with its new democracy, would have been held in perpetual tutelage\\n', 'to the seaboard or perhaps been driven into independence as the thirteen\\n', 'colonies had been not long before.\\n', '\\n', '=Eastern Friends of the West.=--Fortunately for the nation, there were\\n', 'many Eastern leaders, particularly from the South, who understood the\\n', 'West, approved its spirit, and sought to bring the two sections together\\n', 'by common bonds. Washington kept alive and keen the zeal for Western\\n', 'advancement which he acquired in his youth as a surveyor. He never grew\\n', 'tired of urging upon his Eastern friends the importance of the lands\\n', 'beyond the mountains. He pressed upon the governor of Virginia a project\\n', 'for a wagon road connecting the seaboard with the Ohio country and was\\n', 'active in a movement to improve the navigation of the Potomac. He\\n', 'advocated strengthening the ties of commerce. \"Smooth the roads,\" he\\n', 'said, \"and make easy the way for them, and then see what an influx of\\n', 'articles will be poured upon us; how amazingly our exports will be\\n', 'increased by them; and how amply we shall be compensated for any trouble\\n', 'and expense we may encounter to effect it.\" Jefferson, too, was\\n', 'interested in every phase of Western development--the survey of lands,\\n', 'the exploration of waterways, the opening of trade, and even the\\n', 'discovery of the bones of prehistoric animals. Robert Fulton, the\\n', 'inventor of the steamboat, was another man of vision who for many years\\n', 'pressed upon his countrymen the necessity of uniting East and West by a\\n', 'canal which would cement the union, raise the value of the public lands,\\n', 'and extend the principles of confederate and republican government.\\n', '\\n', '=The Difficulties of Early Transportation.=--Means of communication\\n', 'played an important part in the strategy of all those who sought to\\n', 'bring together the seaboard and the frontier. The produce of the\\n', 'West--wheat, corn, bacon, hemp, cattle, and tobacco--was bulky and the\\n', 'cost of overland transportation was prohibitive. In the Eastern market,\\n', '\"a cow and her calf were given for a bushel of salt, while a suit of\\n', '\\'store clothes\\' cost as much as a farm.\" In such circumstances, the\\n', 'inhabitants of the Mississippi Valley were forced to ship their produce\\n', 'over a long route by way of New Orleans and to pay high freight rates\\n', 'for everything that was brought across the mountains. Scows of from five\\n', 'to fifty tons were built at the towns along the rivers and piloted down\\n', 'the stream to the Crescent City. In a few cases small ocean-going\\n', 'vessels were built to transport goods to the West Indies or to the\\n', 'Eastern coast towns. Salt, iron, guns, powder, and the absolute\\n', 'essentials which the pioneers had to buy mainly in Eastern markets were\\n', 'carried over narrow wagon trails that were almost impassable in the\\n', 'rainy season.\\n', '\\n', '=The National Road.=--To far-sighted men, like Albert Gallatin, \"the\\n', 'father of internal improvements,\" the solution of this problem was the\\n', \"construction of roads and canals. Early in Jefferson's administration,\\n\", 'Congress dedicated a part of the proceeds from the sale of lands to\\n', 'building highways from the headwaters of the navigable waters emptying\\n', 'into the Atlantic to the Ohio River and beyond into the Northwest\\n', 'territory. In 1806, after many misgivings, it authorized a great\\n', 'national highway binding the East and the West. The Cumberland Road, as\\n', 'it was called, began in northwestern Maryland, wound through southern\\n', 'Pennsylvania, crossed the narrow neck of Virginia at Wheeling, and then\\n', 'shot almost straight across Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, into Missouri.\\n', 'By 1817, stagecoaches were running between Washington and Wheeling; by\\n', '1833 contractors had carried their work to Columbus, Ohio, and by 1852,\\n', 'to Vandalia, Illinois. Over this ballasted road mail and passenger\\n', 'coaches could go at high speed, and heavy freight wagons proceed in\\n', 'safety at a steady pace.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: THE CUMBERLAND ROAD]\\n', '\\n', '=Canals and Steamboats.=--A second epoch in the economic union of the\\n', 'East and West was reached with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825,\\n', 'offering an all-water route from New York City to the Great Lakes and\\n', 'the Mississippi Valley. Pennsylvania, alarmed by the advantages\\n', 'conferred on New York by this enterprise, began her system of canals and\\n', 'portages from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, completing the last link in\\n', '1834. In the South, the Chesapeake and Ohio Company, chartered in 1825,\\n', 'was busy with a project to connect Georgetown and Cumberland when\\n', 'railways broke in upon the undertaking before it was half finished.\\n', 'About the same time, Ohio built a canal across the state, affording\\n', 'water communication between Lake Erie and the Ohio River through a rich\\n', 'wheat belt. Passengers could now travel by canal boat into the West with\\n', 'comparative ease and comfort, if not at a rapid speed, and the bulkiest\\n', 'of freight could be easily handled. Moreover, the rate charged for\\n', 'carrying goods was cut by the Erie Canal from $32 a ton per hundred\\n', 'miles to $1. New Orleans was destined to lose her primacy in the\\n', 'Mississippi Valley.\\n', '\\n', 'The diversion of traffic to Eastern markets was also stimulated by\\n', 'steamboats which appeared on the Ohio about 1810, three years after\\n', 'Fulton had made his famous trip on the Hudson. It took twenty men to\\n', 'sail and row a five-ton scow up the river at a speed of from ten to\\n', 'twenty miles a day. In 1825, Timothy Flint traveled a hundred miles a\\n', 'day on the new steamer _Grecian_ \"against the whole weight of the\\n', 'Mississippi current.\" Three years later the round trip from Louisville\\n', 'to New Orleans was cut to eight days.

The Southern states will first avail themselves of their\\n', 'new confederates to govern the East, and finally the Western states,\\n', 'multiplied in number, and augmented in population, will control the\\n', 'interests of the whole.\" Strangely enough the fulfillment of this\\n', 'prophecy was being prepared even in Federalist strongholds by the rise\\n', 'of a new urban democracy that was to make common cause with the farmers\\n', 'beyond the mountains.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT IN THE EAST\\n', '\\n', '=The Aristocratic Features of the Old Order.=--The Revolutionary\\n', 'fathers, in setting up their first state constitutions, although they\\n', 'often spoke of government as founded on the consent of the governed, did\\n', 'not think that consistency required giving the vote to all adult males.\\n', 'On the contrary they looked upon property owners as the only safe\\n', '\"depositary\" of political power. They went back to the colonial\\n', 'tradition that related taxation and representation. This, they argued,\\n', 'was not only just but a safeguard against the \"excesses of democracy.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In carrying their theory into execution they placed taxpaying or\\n', 'property qualifications on the right to vote. Broadly speaking, these\\n', 'limitations fell into three classes. Three states, Pennsylvania (1776),\\n', 'New Hampshire (1784), and Georgia (1798), gave the ballot to all who\\n', 'paid taxes, without reference to the value of their property. Three,\\n', 'Virginia, Delaware, and Rhode Island, clung firmly to the ancient\\n', 'principles that only freeholders could be intrusted with electoral\\n', 'rights. Still other states, while closely restricting the suffrage,\\n', 'accepted the ownership of other things as well as land in fulfillment of\\n', 'the requirements. In Massachusetts, for instance, the vote was granted\\n', 'to all men who held land yielding an annual income of three pounds or\\n', 'possessed other property worth sixty pounds.\\n', '\\n', 'The electors thus enfranchised, numerous as they were, owing to the wide\\n', 'distribution of land, often suffered from a very onerous disability. In\\n', 'many states they were able to vote only for persons of wealth because\\n', 'heavy property qualifications were imposed on public officers. In New\\n', 'Hampshire, the governor had to be worth five hundred pounds, one-half in\\n', 'land; in Massachusetts, one thousand pounds, all freehold; in Maryland,\\n', 'five thousand pounds, one thousand of which was freehold; in North\\n', 'Carolina, one thousand pounds freehold; and in South Carolina, ten\\n', 'thousand pounds freehold.

For members of the lower house\\n', 'of the legislature lower qualifications were required.\\n', '\\n', 'In most of the states the suffrage or office holding or both were\\n', 'further restricted by religious provisions. No single sect was powerful\\n', 'enough to dominate after the Revolution, but, for the most part,\\n', 'Catholics and Jews were either disfranchised or excluded from office.\\n', 'North Carolina and Georgia denied the ballot to any one who was not a\\n', 'Protestant. Delaware withheld it from all who did not believe in the\\n', 'Trinity and the inspiration of the Scriptures. Massachusetts and\\n', 'Maryland limited it to Christians.

In the beginning they were viewed as\\n', 'fundamental. As towns grew in size and the number of landless citizens\\n', 'increased, the restrictions were defended with even more vigor. In\\n', 'Massachusetts, the great Webster upheld the rights of property in\\n', 'government, saying: \"It is entirely just that property should have its\\n', 'due weight and consideration in political arrangements.... The\\n', 'disastrous revolutions which the world has witnessed, those political\\n', 'thunderstorms and earthquakes which have shaken the pillars of society\\n', 'to their deepest foundations, have been revolutions against property.\"\\n', 'In Pennsylvania, a leader in local affairs cried out against a plan to\\n', 'remove the taxpaying limitation on the suffrage: \"What does the delegate\\n', 'propose? To place the vicious vagrant, the wandering Arabs, the Tartar\\n', 'hordes of our large cities on the level with the virtuous and good man?\"\\n', 'In Virginia, Jefferson himself had first believed in property\\n', 'qualifications and had feared with genuine alarm the \"mobs of the great\\n', 'cities.\" It was near the end of the eighteenth century before he\\n', 'accepted the idea of manhood suffrage. Even then he was unable to\\n', 'convince the constitution-makers of his own state. \"It is not an idle\\n', 'chimera of the brain,\" urged one of them, \"that the possession of land\\n', 'furnishes the strongest evidence of permanent, common interest with, and\\n', 'attachment to, the community....

This is the best general standard which can\\n', 'be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the persons to be\\n', 'invested with the right of suffrage are such persons as could be,\\n', 'consistently with the safety and well-being of the community, intrusted\\n', 'with the exercise of that right.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Attacks on the Restricted Suffrage.=--The changing circumstances of\\n', 'American life, however, soon challenged the rule of those with property.\\n', 'Prominent among the new forces were the rising mercantile and business\\n', 'interests. Where the freehold qualification was applied, business men\\n', 'who did not own land were deprived of the vote and excluded from office.\\n', 'In New York, for example, the most illiterate farmer who had one hundred\\n', \"pounds' worth of land could vote for state senator and governor, while\\n\", 'the landless banker or merchant could not. It is not surprising,\\n', 'therefore, to find business men taking the lead in breaking down\\n', 'freehold limitations on the suffrage. The professional classes also were\\n', 'interested in removing the barriers which excluded many of them from\\n', 'public affairs. It was a schoolmaster, Thomas Dorr, who led the popular\\n', 'uprising in Rhode Island which brought the exclusive rule by freeholders\\n', 'to an end.\\n', '\\n', 'In addition to the business and professional classes, the mechanics of\\n', 'the towns showed a growing hostility to a system of government that\\n', 'generally barred them from voting or holding office. Though not\\n', 'numerous, they had early begun to exercise an influence on the course of\\n', 'public affairs. They had led the riots against the Stamp Act, overturned\\n', 'King George\\'s statue, and \"crammed stamps down the throats of\\n', 'collectors.\" When the state constitutions were framed they took a lively\\n', 'interest, particularly in New York City and Philadelphia. In June, 1776,\\n', 'the \"mechanicks in union\" in New York protested against putting the new\\n', 'state constitution into effect without their approval, declaring that\\n', 'the right to vote on the acceptance or rejection of a fundamental law\\n', '\"is the birthright of every man to whatever state he may belong.\" Though\\n', 'their petition was rejected, their spirit remained. When, a few years\\n', 'later, the federal Constitution was being framed, the mechanics watched\\n', 'the process with deep concern; they knew that one of its main objects\\n', 'was to promote trade and commerce, affecting directly their daily bread.\\n', 'During the struggle over ratification, they passed resolutions approving\\n', 'its provisions and they often joined in parades organized to stir up\\n', 'sentiment for the Constitution, even though they could not vote for\\n', 'members of the state conventions and so express their will directly.\\n', 'After the organization of trade unions they collided with the courts of\\n', 'law and thus became interested in the election of judges and lawmakers.\\n', '\\n', 'Those who attacked the old system of class rule found a strong moral\\n', 'support in the Declaration of Independence. Was it not said that all men\\n', 'are created equal? Whoever runs may read. Was it not declared that\\n', 'governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed?\\n', 'That doctrine was applied with effect to George III and seemed\\n', 'appropriate for use against the privileged classes of Massachusetts or\\n', 'Virginia. \"How do the principles thus proclaimed,\" asked the\\n', 'non-freeholders of Richmond, in petitioning for the ballot, \"accord with\\n', 'the existing regulation of the suffrage? A regulation which, instead of\\n', 'the equality nature ordains, creates an odious distinction between\\n', 'members of the same community ... and vests in a favored class, not in\\n', 'consideration of their public services but of their private possessions,\\n', 'the highest of all privileges.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Abolition of Property Qualifications.=--By many minor victories rather\\n', 'than by any spectacular triumphs did the advocates of manhood suffrage\\n', 'carry the day. Slight gains were made even during the Revolution or\\n', 'shortly afterward. In Pennsylvania, the mechanics, by taking an active\\n', 'part in the contest over the Constitution of 1776, were able to force\\n', 'the qualification down to the payment of a small tax. Vermont came into\\n', 'the union in 1792 without any property restrictions. In the same year\\n', 'Delaware gave the vote to all men who paid taxes. Maryland, reckoned one\\n', 'of the most conservative of states, embarked on the experiment of\\n', 'manhood suffrage in 1809; and nine years later, Connecticut, equally\\n', 'conservative, decided that all taxpayers were worthy of the ballot.\\n', '\\n', 'Five states, Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, Rhode Island, and North\\n', 'Carolina, remained obdurate while these changes were going on around\\n', 'them; finally they had to yield themselves. The last struggle in\\n', 'Massachusetts took place in the constitutional convention of 1820. There\\n', 'Webster, in the prime of his manhood, and John Adams, in the closing\\n', 'years of his old age, alike protested against such radical innovations\\n', 'as manhood suffrage. Their protests were futile. The property test was\\n', 'abolished and a small tax-paying qualification was substituted. New York\\n', 'surrendered the next year and, after trying some minor restrictions for\\n', 'five years, went completely over to white manhood suffrage in 1826.\\n', 'Rhode Island clung to her freehold qualification through thirty years of\\n', \"agitation. Then Dorr's Rebellion, almost culminating in bloodshed,\\n\", 'brought about a reform in 1843 which introduced a slight tax-paying\\n', 'qualification as an alternative to the freehold. Virginia and North\\n', 'Carolina were still unconvinced. The former refused to abandon ownership\\n', 'of land as the test for political rights until 1850 and the latter until\\n', '1856. Although religious discriminations and property qualifications for\\n', 'office holders were sometimes retained after the establishment of\\n', 'manhood suffrage, they were usually abolished along with the monopoly of\\n', 'government enjoyed by property owners and taxpayers.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: THOMAS DORR AROUSING HIS FOLLOWERS]\\n', '\\n', 'At the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century, the white\\n', 'male industrial workers and the mechanics of the Northern cities, at\\n', 'least, could lay aside the petition for the ballot and enjoy with the\\n', 'free farmer a voice in the government of their common country.\\n', '\"Universal democracy,\" sighed Carlyle, who was widely read in the United\\n', 'States, \"whatever we may think of it has declared itself the inevitable\\n', 'fact of the days in which we live; and he who has any chance to instruct\\n', 'or lead in these days must begin by admitting that ... Where no\\n', 'government is wanted, save that of the parish constable, as in America\\n', 'with its boundless soil, every man being able to find work and\\n', 'recompense for himself, democracy may subsist; not elsewhere.\" Amid the\\n', 'grave misgivings of the first generation of statesmen, America was\\n', 'committed to the great adventure, in the populous towns of the East as\\n', 'well as in the forests and fields of the West.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE NEW DEMOCRACY ENTERS THE ARENA\\n', '\\n', 'The spirit of the new order soon had a pronounced effect on the\\n', 'machinery of government and the practice of politics. The enfranchised\\n', 'electors were not long in demanding for themselves a larger share in\\n', 'administration.\\n', '\\n', '=The Spoils System and Rotation in Office.=--First of all they wanted\\n', 'office for themselves, regardless of their fitness. They therefore\\n', 'extended the system of rewarding party workers with government\\n', 'positions--a system early established in several states, notably New\\n', 'York and Pennsylvania. Closely connected with it was the practice of\\n', 'fixing short terms for officers and making frequent changes in\\n', 'personnel. \"Long continuance in office,\" explained a champion of this\\n', 'idea in Pennsylvania in 1837, \"unfits a man for the discharge of its\\n', 'duties, by rendering him arbitrary and aristocratic, and tends to beget,\\n', 'first life office, and then hereditary office, which leads to the\\n', 'destruction of free government.\" The solution offered was the historic\\n', 'doctrine of \"rotation in office.\" At the same time the principle of\\n', 'popular election was extended to an increasing number of officials who\\n', 'had once been appointed either by the governor or the legislature. Even\\n', 'geologists, veterinarians, surveyors, and other technical officers were\\n', 'declared elective on the theory that their appointment \"smacked of\\n', 'monarchy.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Popular Election of Presidential Electors.=--In a short time the spirit\\n', 'of democracy, while playing havoc with the old order in state\\n', 'government, made its way upward into the federal system. The framers of\\n', 'the Constitution, bewildered by many proposals and unable to agree on\\n', 'any single plan, had committed the choice of presidential electors to\\n', 'the discretion of the state legislatures. The legislatures, in turn,\\n', 'greedy of power, early adopted the practice of choosing the electors\\n', 'themselves; but they did not enjoy it long undisturbed. Democracy,\\n', 'thundering at their doors, demanded that they surrender the privilege to\\n', 'the people. Reluctantly they yielded, sometimes granting popular\\n', 'election and then withdrawing it. The drift was inevitable, and the\\n', 'climax came with the advent of Jacksonian democracy. In 1824, Vermont,\\n', 'New York, Delaware, South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana, though some\\n', 'had experimented with popular election, still left the choice of\\n', 'electors with the legislature. Eight years later South Carolina alone\\n', 'held to the old practice. Popular election had become the final word.\\n', 'The fanciful idea of an electoral college of \"good and wise men,\"\\n', 'selected without passion or partisanship by state legislatures acting as\\n', 'deliberative bodies, was exploded for all time; the election of the\\n', \"nation's chief magistrate was committed to the tempestuous methods of\\n\", 'democracy.\\n', '\\n', '=The Nominating Convention.=--As the suffrage was widened and the\\n', 'popular choice of presidential electors extended, there arose a violent\\n', 'protest against the methods used by the political parties in nominating\\n', 'candidates. After the retirement of Washington, both the Republicans and\\n', 'the Federalists found it necessary to agree upon their favorites before\\n', 'the election, and they adopted a colonial device--the pre-election\\n', 'caucus. The Federalist members of Congress held a conference and\\n', 'selected their candidate, and the Republicans followed the example. In\\n', 'a short time the practice of nominating by a \"congressional caucus\"\\n', 'became a recognized institution. The election still remained with the\\n', 'people; but the power of picking candidates for their approval passed\\n', 'into the hands of a small body of Senators and Representatives.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'A reaction against this was unavoidable. To friends of \"the plain\\n', 'people,\" like Andrew Jackson, it was intolerable, all the more so\\n', 'because the caucus never favored him with the nomination. More\\n', 'conservative men also found grave objections to it. They pointed out\\n', 'that, whereas the Constitution intended the President to be an\\n', 'independent officer, he had now fallen under the control of a caucus of\\n', 'congressmen. The supremacy of the legislative branch had been obtained\\n', 'by an extra-legal political device. To such objections were added\\n', 'practical considerations. In 1824, when personal rivalry had taken the\\n', 'place of party conflicts, the congressional caucus selected as the\\n', 'candidate, William H. Crawford, of Georgia, a man of distinction but no\\n', 'great popularity, passing by such an obvious hero as General Jackson.\\n', 'The followers of the General were enraged and demanded nothing short of\\n', 'the death of \"King Caucus.\" Their clamor was effective. Under their\\n', 'attacks, the caucus came to an ignominious end.\\n', '\\n', 'In place of it there arose in 1831 a new device, the national nominating\\n', 'convention, composed of delegates elected by party voters for the sole\\n', 'purpose of nominating candidates. Senators and Representatives were\\n', 'still prominent in the party councils, but they were swamped by hundreds\\n', 'of delegates \"fresh from the people,\" as Jackson was wont to say. In\\n', 'fact, each convention was made up mainly of office holders and office\\n', 'seekers, and the new institution was soon denounced as vigorously as\\n', 'King Caucus had been, particularly by statesmen who failed to obtain a\\n', 'nomination. Still it grew in strength and by 1840 was firmly\\n', 'established.\\n', '\\n', '=The End of the Old Generation.=--In the election of 1824, the\\n', 'representatives of the \"aristocracy\" made their last successful stand.\\n', 'Until then the leadership by men of \"wealth and talents\" had been\\n', 'undisputed. There had been five Presidents--Washington, John Adams,\\n', 'Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe--all Eastern men brought up in prosperous\\n', 'families with the advantages of culture which come from leisure and the\\n', \"possession of life's refinements. None of them had ever been compelled\\n\", 'to work with his hands for a livelihood. Four of them had been\\n', 'slaveholders. Jefferson was a philosopher, learned in natural science, a\\n', 'master of foreign languages, a gentleman of dignity and grace of manner,\\n', 'notwithstanding his studied simplicity. Madison, it was said, was armed\\n', '\"with all the culture of his century.\" Monroe was a graduate of William\\n', 'and Mary, a gentleman of the old school. Jefferson and his three\\n', 'successors called themselves Republicans and professed a genuine faith\\n', 'in the people but they were not \"of the people\" themselves; they were\\n', 'not sons of the soil or the workshop. They were all men of \"the grand\\n', '\\n', 'old order of society\" who gave finish and style even to popular\\n', 'government.\\n', '\\n', 'Monroe was the last of the Presidents belonging to the heroic epoch of\\n', 'the Revolution. He had served in the war for independence, in the\\n', 'Congress under the Articles of Confederation, and in official capacity\\n', 'after the adoption of the Constitution. In short, he was of the age that\\n', 'had wrought American independence and set the government afloat. With\\n', 'his passing, leadership went to a new generation; but his successor,\\n', 'John Quincy Adams, formed a bridge between the old and the new in that\\n', 'he combined a high degree of culture with democratic sympathies.\\n', 'Washington had died in 1799, preceded but a few months by Patrick Henry\\n', 'and followed in four years by Samuel Adams. Hamilton had been killed in\\n', 'a duel with Burr in 1804. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were yet alive\\n', 'in 1824 but they were soon to pass from the scene, reconciled at last,\\n', 'full of years and honors. Madison was in dignified retirement, destined\\n', 'to live long enough to protest against the doctrine of nullification\\n', 'proclaimed by South Carolina before death carried him away at the ripe\\n', 'old age of eighty-five.\\n', '\\n', '=The Election of John Quincy Adams (1824).=--The campaign of 1824 marked\\n', 'the end of the \"era of good feeling\" inaugurated by the collapse of the\\n', 'Federalist party after the election of 1816. There were four leading\\n', 'candidates, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, and W.H.\\n', 'Crawford. The result of the election was a division of the electoral\\n', 'votes into four parts and no one received a majority. Under the\\n', 'Constitution, therefore, the selection of President passed to the House\\n', 'of Representatives. Clay, who stood at the bottom of the poll, threw his\\n', 'weight to Adams and assured his triumph, much to the chagrin of\\n', \"Jackson's friends. They thought, with a certain justification, that\\n\", 'inasmuch as the hero of New Orleans had received the largest electoral\\n', 'vote, the House was morally bound to accept the popular judgment and\\n', 'make him President. Jackson shook hands cordially with Adams on the day\\n', 'of the inauguration, but never forgave him for being elected.\\n', '\\n', 'While Adams called himself a Republican in politics and often spoke of\\n', '\"the rule of the people,\" he was regarded by Jackson\\'s followers as \"an\\n', 'aristocrat.\" He was not a son of the soil. Neither was he acquainted at\\n', 'first hand with the labor of farmers and mechanics. He had been educated\\n', 'at Harvard and in Europe. Like his illustrious father, John Adams, he\\n', 'was a stern and reserved man, little given to seeking popularity.\\n', 'Moreover, he was from the East and the frontiersmen of the West regarded\\n', 'him as a man \"born with a silver spoon in his mouth.\" Jackson\\'s\\n', 'supporters especially disliked him because they thought their hero\\n', 'entitled to the presidency. Their anger was deepened when Adams\\n', 'appointed Clay to the office of Secretary of State; and they set up a\\n', 'cry that there had been a \"deal\" by which Clay had helped to elect Adams\\n', 'to get office for himself.\\n', '\\n', 'Though Adams conducted his administration with great dignity and in a\\n', 'fine spirit of public service, he was unable to overcome the opposition\\n', 'which he encountered on his election to office or to win popularity in\\n', 'the West and South. On the contrary, by advocating government assistance\\n', 'in building roads and canals and public grants in aid of education,\\n', 'arts, and sciences, he ran counter to the current which had set in\\n', 'against appropriations of federal funds for internal improvements. By\\n', 'signing the Tariff Bill of 1828, soon known as the \"Tariff of\\n', 'Abominations,\" he made new enemies without adding to his friends in New\\n', 'York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio where he sorely needed them. Handicapped by\\n', 'the false charge that he had been a party to a \"corrupt bargain\" with\\n', 'Clay to secure his first election; attacked for his advocacy of a high\\n', 'protective tariff; charged with favoring an \"aristocracy of\\n', 'office-holders\" in Washington on account of his refusal to discharge\\n', 'government clerks by the wholesale, Adams was retired from the White\\n', 'House after he had served four years.\\n', '\\n', '=The Triumph of Jackson in 1828.=--Probably no candidate for the\\n', 'presidency ever had such passionate popular support as Andrew Jackson\\n', 'had in 1828. He was truly a man of the people. Born of poor parents in\\n', 'the upland region of South Carolina, schooled in poverty and adversity,\\n', 'without the advantages of education or the refinements of cultivated\\n', 'leisure, he seemed the embodiment of the spirit of the new American\\n', 'democracy. Early in his youth he had gone into the frontier of Tennessee\\n', 'where he soon won a name as a fearless and intrepid Indian fighter. On\\n', 'the march and in camp, he endeared himself to his men by sharing their\\n', 'hardships, sleeping on the ground with them, and eating parched corn\\n', 'when nothing better could be found for the privates. From local\\n', 'prominence he sprang into national fame by his exploit at the battle of\\n', 'New Orleans. His reputation as a military hero was enhanced by the\\n', 'feeling that he had been a martyr to political treachery in 1824. The\\n', 'farmers of the West and South claimed him as their own. The mechanics of\\n', 'the Eastern cities, newly enfranchised, also looked upon him as their\\n', 'friend. Though his views on the tariff, internal improvements, and other\\n', 'issues before the country were either vague or unknown, he was readily\\n', 'elected President.\\n', '\\n', 'The returns of the electoral vote in 1828 revealed the sources of\\n', \"Jackson's power. In New England, he received but one ballot, from\\n\", 'Maine; he had a majority of the electors in New York and all of them in\\n', 'Pennsylvania; and he carried every state south of Maryland and beyond\\n', 'the Appalachians. Adams did not get a single electoral vote in the South\\n', 'and West. The prophecy of the Hartford convention had been fulfilled.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: ANDREW JACKSON]\\n', '\\n', 'When Jackson took the oath of office on March 4, 1829, the government of\\n', 'the United States entered into a new era. Until this time the\\n', 'inauguration of a President--even that of Jefferson, the apostle of\\n', 'simplicity--had brought no rude shock to the course of affairs at the\\n', 'capital. Hitherto the installation of a President meant that an\\n', 'old-fashioned gentleman, accompanied by a few servants, had driven to\\n', 'the White House in his own coach, taken the oath with quiet dignity,\\n', 'appointed a few new men to the higher posts, continued in office the\\n', 'long list of regular civil employees, and begun his administration with\\n', 'respectable decorum. Jackson changed all this. When he was inaugurated,\\n', 'men and women journeyed hundreds of miles to witness the ceremony. Great\\n', 'throngs pressed into the White House, \"upset the bowls of punch, broke\\n', 'the glasses, and stood with their muddy boots on the satin-covered\\n', 'chairs to see the people\\'s President.\" If Jefferson\\'s inauguration was,\\n', 'as he called it, the \"great revolution,\" Jackson\\'s inauguration was a\\n', 'cataclysm.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE NEW DEMOCRACY AT WASHINGTON\\n', '\\n', '=The Spoils System.=--The staid and respectable society of Washington\\n', 'was disturbed by this influx of farmers and frontiersmen. To speak of\\n', 'politics became \"bad form\" among fashionable women. The clerks and\\n', 'civil servants of the government who had enjoyed long and secure tenure\\n', 'of office became alarmed at the clamor of new men for their positions.\\n', 'Doubtless the major portion of them had opposed the election of Jackson\\n', 'and looked with feelings akin to contempt upon him and his followers.\\n', \"With a hunter's instinct, Jackson scented his prey. Determined to have\\n\", 'none but his friends in office, he made a clean sweep, expelling old\\n', 'employees to make room for men \"fresh from the people.\" This was a new\\n', 'custom. Other Presidents had discharged a few officers for engaging in\\n', 'opposition politics. They had been careful in making appointments not to\\n', 'choose inveterate enemies; but they discharged relatively few men on\\n', 'account of their political views and partisan activities.\\n', '\\n', 'By wholesale removals and the frank selection of officers on party\\n', 'grounds--a practice already well intrenched in New York--Jackson\\n', 'established the \"spoils system\" at Washington. The famous slogan, \"to\\n', 'the victor belong the spoils of victory,\" became the avowed principle of\\n', 'the national government. Statesmen like Calhoun denounced it; poets like\\n', 'James Russell Lowell ridiculed it; faithful servants of the government\\n', 'suffered under it; but it held undisturbed sway for half a century\\n', 'thereafter, each succeeding generation outdoing, if possible, its\\n', 'predecessor in the use of public office for political purposes. If any\\n', 'one remarked that training and experience were necessary qualifications\\n', \"for important public positions, he met Jackson's own profession of\\n\", 'faith: \"The duties of any public office are so simple or admit of being\\n', 'made so simple that any man can in a short time become master of them.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Tariff and Nullification.=--Jackson had not been installed in power\\n', \"very long before he was compelled to choose between states' rights and\\n\", 'nationalism. The immediate occasion of the trouble was the tariff--a\\n', 'matter on which Jackson did not have any very decided views. His mind\\n', 'did not run naturally to abstruse economic questions; and owing to the\\n', 'divided opinion of the country it was \"good politics\" to be vague and\\n', 'ambiguous in the controversy. Especially was this true, because the\\n', 'tariff issue was threatening to split the country into parties again.\\n', '\\n', '_The Development of the Policy of \"Protection.\"_--The war of 1812 and\\n', 'the commercial policies of England which followed it had accentuated the\\n', 'need for American economic independence. During that conflict, the\\n', 'United States, cut off from English manufactures as during the\\n', 'Revolution, built up home industries to meet the unusual call for iron,\\n', 'steel, cloth, and other military and naval supplies as well as the\\n', 'demands from ordinary markets. Iron foundries and textile mills sprang\\n', 'up as in the night; hundreds of business men invested fortunes in\\n', 'industrial enterprises so essential to the military needs of the\\n', 'government; and the people at large fell into the habit of buying\\n', 'American-made goods again. As the London _Times_ tersely observed of the\\n', 'Americans, \"their first war with England made them independent; their\\n', 'second war made them formidable.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In recognition of this state of affairs, the tariff of 1816 was\\n', 'designed: _first_, to prevent England from ruining these \"infant\\n', 'industries\" by dumping the accumulated stores of years suddenly upon\\n', 'American markets; and, _secondly_, to enlarge in the manufacturing\\n', 'centers the demand for American agricultural produce. It accomplished\\n', 'the purposes of its framers. It kept in operation the mills and furnaces\\n', 'so recently built. It multiplied the number of industrial workers and\\n', 'enhanced the demand for the produce of the soil. It brought about\\n', 'another very important result. It turned the capital and enterprise of\\n', 'New England from shipping to manufacturing, and converted her statesmen,\\n', 'once friends of low tariffs, into ardent advocates of protection.\\n', '\\n', 'In the early years of the nineteenth century, the Yankees had bent their\\n', 'energies toward building and operating ships to carry produce from\\n', 'America to Europe and manufactures from Europe to America. For this\\n', 'reason, they had opposed the tariff of 1816 calculated to increase\\n', 'domestic production and cut down the carrying trade. Defeated in their\\n', 'efforts, they accepted the inevitable and turned to manufacturing. Soon\\n', 'they were powerful friends of protection for American enterprise. As the\\n', 'money invested and the labor employed in the favored industries\\n', 'increased, the demand for continued and heavier protection grew apace.\\n', 'Even the farmers who furnished raw materials, like wool, flax, and hemp,\\n', 'began to see eye to eye with the manufacturers. So the textile interests\\n', 'of New England, the iron masters of Connecticut, New Jersey, and\\n', 'Pennsylvania, the wool, hemp, and flax growers of Ohio, Kentucky, and\\n', 'Tennessee, and the sugar planters of Louisiana developed into a\\n', 'formidable combination in support of a high protective tariff.\\n', '\\n', '_The Planting States Oppose the Tariff._--In the meantime, the cotton\\n', 'states on the seaboard had forgotten about the havoc wrought during the\\n', 'Napoleonic wars when their produce rotted because there were no ships to\\n', 'carry it to Europe. The seas were now open. The area devoted to cotton\\n', 'had swiftly expanded as Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana were opened\\n', 'up. Cotton had in fact become \"king\" and the planters depended for their\\n', 'prosperity, as they thought, upon the sale of their staple to English\\n', 'manufacturers whose spinning and weaving mills were the wonder of the\\n', 'world. Manufacturing nothing and having to buy nearly everything except\\n', 'farm produce and even much of that for slaves, the planters naturally\\n', 'wanted to purchase manufactures in the cheapest market, England, where\\n', 'they sold most of their cotton. The tariff, they contended, raised the\\n', 'price of the goods they had to buy and was thus in fact a tribute laid\\n', 'on them for the benefit of the Northern mill owners.\\n', '\\n', '_The Tariff of Abominations._--They were overborne, however, in 1824 and\\n', 'again in 1828 when Northern manufacturers and Western farmers forced\\n', 'Congress to make an upward revision of the tariff. The Act of 1828 known\\n', 'as \"the Tariff of Abominations,\" though slightly modified in 1832, was\\n', '\"the straw which broke the camel\\'s back.\" Southern leaders turned in\\n', 'rage against the whole system. The legislatures of Virginia, North\\n', 'Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama denounced it; a general\\n', 'convention of delegates held at Augusta issued a protest of defiance\\n', 'against it; and South Carolina, weary of verbal battles, decided to\\n', 'prevent its enforcement.\\n', '\\n', '_South Carolina Nullifies the Tariff._--The legislature of that state,\\n', 'on October 26, 1832, passed a bill calling for a state convention which\\n', 'duly assembled in the following month. In no mood for compromise, it\\n', \"adopted the famous Ordinance of Nullification after a few days' debate.\\n\", 'Every line of this document was clear and firm. The tariff, it opened,\\n', 'gives \"bounties to classes and individuals ... at the expense and to the\\n', 'injury and oppression of other classes and individuals\"; it is a\\n', 'violation of the Constitution of the United States and therefore null\\n', 'and void; its enforcement in South Carolina is unlawful; if the federal\\n', 'government attempts to coerce the state into obeying the law, \"the\\n', 'people of this state will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all\\n', 'further obligations to maintain or preserve their political connection\\n', 'with the people of the other states and will forthwith proceed to\\n', 'organize a separate government and do all other acts and things which\\n', 'sovereign and independent states may of right do.\"\\n', '\\n', '_Southern States Condemn Nullification._--The answer of the country to\\n', 'this note of defiance, couched in the language used in the Kentucky\\n', 'resolutions and by the New England Federalists during the war of 1812,\\n', 'was quick and positive. The legislatures of the Southern states, while\\n', 'condemning the tariff, repudiated the step which South Carolina had\\n', 'taken. Georgia responded: \"We abhor the doctrine of nullification as\\n', 'neither a peaceful nor a constitutional remedy.\" Alabama found it\\n', '\"unsound in theory and dangerous in practice.\" North Carolina replied\\n', 'that it was \"revolutionary in character, subversive of the Constitution\\n', 'of the United States.\" Mississippi answered: \"It is disunion by\\n', 'force--it is civil war.\" Virginia spoke more softly, condemning the\\n', 'tariff and sustaining the principle of the Virginia resolutions but\\n', 'denying that South Carolina could find in them any sanction for her\\n', 'proceedings.\\n', '\\n', '_Jackson Firmly Upholds the Union._--The eyes of the country were turned\\n', 'upon Andrew Jackson.

Then in a\\n', 'long and impassioned proclamation to the people of South Carolina he\\n', 'pointed out the national character of the union, and announced his\\n', 'solemn resolve to preserve it by all constitutional means. Nullification\\n', 'he branded as \"incompatible with the existence of the union,\\n', 'contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized\\n', 'by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was\\n', 'founded, and destructive of the great objects for which it was formed.\"\\n', '\\n', '_A Compromise._--In his messages to Congress, however, Jackson spoke the\\n', 'language of conciliation. A few days before issuing his proclamation he\\n', 'suggested that protection should be limited to the articles of domestic\\n', 'manufacture indispensable to safety in war time, and shortly afterward\\n', 'he asked for new legislation to aid him in enforcing the laws. With two\\n', 'propositions before it, one to remove the chief grounds for South\\n', \"Carolina's resistance and the other to apply force if it was continued,\\n\", 'Congress bent its efforts to avoid a crisis. On February 12, 1833,\\n', 'Henry Clay laid before the Senate a compromise tariff bill providing for\\n', 'the gradual reduction of the duties until by 1842 they would reach the\\n', 'level of the law which Calhoun had supported in 1816. About the same\\n', 'time the \"force bill,\" designed to give the President ample authority in\\n', 'executing the law in South Carolina, was taken up. After a short but\\n', 'acrimonious debate, both measures were passed and signed by President\\n', 'Jackson on the same day, March 2. Looking upon the reduction of the\\n', 'tariff as a complete vindication of her policy and an undoubted victory,\\n', 'South Carolina rescinded her ordinance and enacted another nullifying\\n', 'the force bill.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print._\\n', '\\n', 'DANIEL WEBSTER]\\n', '\\n', '_The Webster-Hayne Debate._--Where the actual victory lay in this\\n', 'quarrel, long the subject of high dispute, need not concern us to-day.\\n', 'Perhaps the chief result of the whole affair was a clarification of the\\n', 'issue between the North and the South--a definite statement of the\\n', 'principles for which men on both sides were years afterward to lay down\\n', 'their lives. On behalf of nationalism and a perpetual union, the stanch\\n', 'old Democrat from Tennessee had, in his proclamation on nullification,\\n', 'spoken a language that admitted of only one meaning. On behalf of\\n', 'nullification, Senator Hayne, of South Carolina, a skilled lawyer and\\n', 'courtly orator, had in a great speech delivered in the Senate in\\n', 'January, 1830, set forth clearly and cogently the doctrine that the\\n', 'union is a compact among sovereign states from which the parties may\\n', 'lawfully withdraw. It was this address that called into the arena\\n', 'Daniel Webster, Senator from Massachusetts, who, spreading the mantle\\n', 'of oblivion over the Hartford convention, delivered a reply to Hayne\\n', 'that has been reckoned among the powerful orations of all time--a plea\\n', 'for the supremacy of the Constitution and the national character of the\\n', 'union.\\n', '\\n', '=The War on the United States Bank.=--If events forced the issue of\\n', 'nationalism and nullification upon Jackson, the same could not be said\\n', 'of his attack on the bank. That institution, once denounced by every\\n', 'true Jeffersonian, had been reestablished in 1816 under the\\n', \"administration of Jefferson's disciple, James Madison. It had not been\\n\", 'in operation very long, however, before it aroused bitter opposition,\\n', 'especially in the South and the West. Its notes drove out of circulation\\n', 'the paper currency of unsound banks chartered by the states, to the\\n', 'great anger of local financiers. It was accused of favoritism in making\\n', 'loans, of conferring special privileges upon politicians in return for\\n', 'their support at Washington. To all Jackson\\'s followers it was \"an\\n', 'insidious money power.\" One of them openly denounced it as an\\n', 'institution designed \"to strengthen the arm of wealth and counterpoise\\n', 'the influence of extended suffrage in the disposition of public\\n', 'affairs.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This sentiment President Jackson fully shared. In his first message to\\n', 'Congress he assailed the bank in vigorous language. He declared that its\\n', 'constitutionality was in doubt and alleged that it had failed to\\n', 'establish a sound and uniform currency. If such an institution was\\n', 'necessary, he continued, it should be a public bank, owned and managed\\n', 'by the government, not a private concern endowed with special privileges\\n', 'by it. In his second and third messages, Jackson came back to the\\n', 'subject, leaving the decision, however, to \"an enlightened people and\\n', 'their representatives.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Moved by this frank hostility and anxious for the future, the bank\\n', 'applied to Congress for a renewal of its charter in 1832, four years\\n', 'before the expiration of its life. Clay, with his eye upon the\\n', 'presidency and an issue for the campaign, warmly supported the\\n', 'application. Congress, deeply impressed by his leadership, passed the\\n', 'bill granting the new charter, and sent the open defiance to Jackson.\\n', 'His response was an instant veto. The battle was on and it raged with\\n', 'fury until the close of his second administration, ending in the\\n', 'destruction of the bank, a disordered currency, and a national panic.\\n', '\\n', 'In his veto message, Jackson attacked the bank as unconstitutional and\\n', 'even hinted at corruption. He refused to assent to the proposition that\\n', 'the Supreme Court had settled the question of constitutionality by the\\n', 'decision in the McCulloch case. \"Each public officer,\" he argued, \"who\\n', 'takes an oath to support the Constitution, swears that he will support\\n', 'it as he understands it, not as it is understood by others.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Not satisfied with his veto and his declaration against the bank,\\n', 'Jackson ordered the Secretary of the Treasury to withdraw the government\\n', \"deposits which formed a large part of the institution's funds. This\\n\", 'action he followed up by an open charge that the bank had used money\\n', 'shamefully to secure the return of its supporters to Congress. The\\n', 'Senate, stung by this charge, solemnly resolved that Jackson had\\n', '\"assumed upon himself authority and power not conferred by the\\n', 'Constitution and laws, but in derogation of both.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The effects of the destruction of the bank were widespread. When its\\n', 'charter expired in 1836, banking was once more committed to the control\\n', 'of the states. The state legislatures, under a decision rendered by the\\n', 'Supreme Court after the death of Marshall, began to charter banks under\\n', 'state ownership and control, with full power to issue paper money--this\\n', 'in spite of the provision in the Constitution that states shall not\\n', 'issue bills of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin legal\\n', 'tender in the payment of debts. Once more the country was flooded by\\n', 'paper currency of uncertain value. To make matters worse, Jackson\\n', 'adopted the practice of depositing huge amounts of government funds in\\n', 'these banks, not forgetting to render favors to those institutions which\\n', 'supported him in politics--\"pet banks,\" as they were styled at the\\n', 'time. In 1837, partially, though by no means entirely, as a result of\\n', 'the abolition of the bank, the country was plunged into one of the most\\n', 'disastrous panics which it ever experienced.\\n', '\\n', '=Internal Improvements Checked.=--The bank had presented to Jackson a\\n', 'very clear problem--one of destruction. Other questions were not so\\n', 'simple, particularly the subject of federal appropriations in aid of\\n', 'roads and other internal improvements. Jefferson had strongly favored\\n', 'government assistance in such matters, but his administration was\\n', 'followed by a reaction. Both Madison and Monroe vetoed acts of Congress\\n', 'appropriating public funds for public roads, advancing as their reason\\n', 'the argument that the Constitution authorized no such laws. Jackson,\\n', 'puzzled by the clamor on both sides, followed their example without\\n', 'making the constitutional bar absolute. Congress, he thought, might\\n', 'lawfully build highways of a national and military value, but he\\n', 'strongly deprecated attacks by local interests on the federal treasury.\\n', '\\n', \"=The Triumph of the Executive Branch.=--Jackson's reelection in 1832\\n\", 'served to confirm his opinion that he was the chosen leader of the\\n', 'people, freed and instructed to ride rough shod over Congress and even\\n', 'the courts. No President before or since ever entertained in times of\\n', 'peace such lofty notions of executive prerogative. The entire body of\\n', 'federal employees he transformed into obedient servants of his wishes, a\\n', 'sign or a nod from him making and undoing the fortunes of the humble and\\n', 'the mighty. His lawful cabinet of advisers, filling all of the high\\n', 'posts in the government, he treated with scant courtesy, preferring\\n', 'rather to secure his counsel and advice from an unofficial body of\\n', 'friends and dependents who, owing to their secret methods and back\\n', 'stairs arrangements, became known as \"the kitchen cabinet.\" Under the\\n', 'leadership of a silent, astute, and resourceful politician, Amos\\n', 'Kendall, this informal gathering of the faithful both gave and carried\\n', \"out decrees and orders, communicating the President's lightest wish or\\n\", 'strictest command to the uttermost part of the country. Resolutely and\\n', 'in the face of bitter opposition Jackson had removed the deposits from\\n', 'the United States Bank. When the Senate protested against this arbitrary\\n', 'conduct, he did not rest until it was forced to expunge the resolution\\n', 'of condemnation; in time one of his lieutenants with his own hands was\\n', 'able to tear the censure from the records. When Chief Justice Marshall\\n', 'issued a decree against Georgia which did not suit him, Jackson,\\n', 'according to tradition, blurted out that Marshall could go ahead and\\n', 'enforce his own orders. To the end he pursued his willful way, finally\\n', 'even choosing his own successor.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE RISE OF THE WHIGS\\n', '\\n', \"=Jackson's Measures Arouse Opposition.=--Measures so decided, policies\\n\", 'so radical, and conduct so high-handed could not fail to arouse against\\n', 'Jackson a deep and exasperated opposition. The truth is the conduct of\\n', 'his entire administration profoundly disturbed the business and finances\\n', 'of the country. It was accompanied by conditions similar to those which\\n', 'existed under the Articles of Confederation. A paper currency, almost as\\n', 'unstable and irritating as the worthless notes of revolutionary days,\\n', 'flooded the country, hindering the easy transaction of business. The use\\n', 'of federal funds for internal improvements, so vital to the exchange of\\n', 'commodities which is the very life of industry, was blocked by executive\\n', 'vetoes. The Supreme Court, which, under Marshall, had held refractory\\n', \"states to their obligations under the Constitution, was flouted; states'\\n\", 'rights judges, deliberately selected by Jackson for the bench, began to\\n', 'sap and undermine the rulings of Marshall. The protective tariff, under\\n', 'which the textile industry of New England, the iron mills of\\n', 'Pennsylvania, and the wool, flax, and hemp farms of the West had\\n', 'flourished, had received a severe blow in the compromise of 1833 which\\n', \"promised a steady reduction of duties. To cap the climax, Jackson's\\n\", 'party, casting aside the old and reputable name of Republican, boldly\\n', 'chose for its title the term \"Democrat,\" throwing down the gauntlet to\\n', 'every conservative who doubted the omniscience of the people. All these\\n', 'things worked together to evoke an opposition that was sharp and\\n', 'determined.\\n', '\\n', \"[Illustration: AN OLD CARTOON RIDICULING CLAY'S TARIFF AND INTERNAL\\n\", 'IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM]\\n', '\\n', '=Clay and the National Republicans.=--In this opposition movement,\\n', 'leadership fell to Henry Clay, a son of Kentucky, rather than to Daniel\\n', 'Webster of Massachusetts. Like Jackson, Clay was born in a home haunted\\n', 'by poverty. Left fatherless early and thrown upon his own resources, he\\n', 'went from Virginia into Kentucky where by sheer force of intellect he\\n', 'rose to eminence in the profession of law. Without the martial gifts or\\n', 'the martial spirit of Jackson, he slipped more easily into the social\\n', 'habits of the East at the same time that he retained his hold on the\\n', 'affections of the boisterous West. Farmers of Ohio, Indiana, and\\n', 'Kentucky loved him; financiers of New York and Philadelphia trusted him.\\n', 'He was thus a leader well fitted to gather the forces of opposition\\n', 'into union against Jackson.\\n', '\\n', \"Around Clay's standard assembled a motley collection, representing every\\n\", 'species of political opinion, united by one tie only--hatred for \"Old\\n', 'Hickory.\" Nullifiers and less strenuous advocates of states\\' rights were\\n', \"yoked with nationalists of Webster's school; ardent protectionists were\\n\", 'bound together with equally ardent free traders, all fraternizing in one\\n', 'grand confusion of ideas under the title of \"National Republicans.\" Thus\\n', 'the ancient and honorable term selected by Jefferson and his party, now\\n', 'abandoned by Jacksonian Democracy, was adroitly adopted to cover the\\n', 'supporters of Clay. The platform of the party, however, embraced all the\\n', 'old Federalist principles: protection for American industry; internal\\n', 'improvements; respect for the Supreme Court; resistance to executive\\n', 'tyranny; and denunciation of the spoils system. Though Jackson was\\n', 'easily victorious in 1832, the popular vote cast for Clay should have\\n', 'given him some doubts about the faith of \"the whole people\" in the\\n', 'wisdom of his \"reign.\"\\n', '\\n', \"=Van Buren and the Panic of 1837.=--Nothing could shake the General's\\n\", 'superb confidence. At the end of his second term he insisted on\\n', 'selecting his own successor; at a national convention, chosen by party\\n', 'voters, but packed with his office holders and friends, he nominated\\n', 'Martin Van Buren of New York. Once more he proved his strength by\\n', 'carrying the country for the Democrats. With a fine flourish, he\\n', 'attended the inauguration of Van Buren and then retired, amid the\\n', 'applause and tears of his devotees, to the Hermitage, his home in\\n', 'Tennessee.\\n', '\\n', 'Fortunately for him, Jackson escaped the odium of a disastrous panic\\n', 'which struck the country with terrible force in the following summer.\\n', 'Among the contributory causes of this crisis, no doubt, were the\\n', 'destruction of the bank and the issuance of the \"specie circular\" of\\n', '\\n', '1836 which required the purchasers of public lands to pay for them in\\n', 'coin, instead of the paper notes of state banks. Whatever the dominating\\n', 'cause, the ruin was widespread. Bank after bank went under; boom towns\\n', 'in the West collapsed; Eastern mills shut down; and working people in\\n', 'the industrial centers, starving from unemployment, begged for relief.\\n', 'Van Buren braved the storm, offering no measure of reform or assistance\\n', 'to the distracted people. He did seek security for government funds by\\n', 'suggesting the removal of deposits from private banks and the\\n', 'establishment of an independent treasury system, with government\\n', 'depositaries for public funds, in several leading cities. This plan was\\n', 'finally accepted by Congress in 1840.\\n', '\\n', 'Had Van Buren been a captivating figure he might have lived down the\\n', 'discredit of the panic unjustly laid at his door; but he was far from\\n', 'being a favorite with the populace. Though a man of many talents, he\\n', 'owed his position to the quiet and adept management of Jackson rather\\n', 'than to his own personal qualities. The men of the frontier did not care\\n', 'for him. They suspected that he ate from \"gold plate\" and they could not\\n', 'forgive him for being an astute politician from New York. Still the\\n', \"Democratic party, remembering Jackson's wishes, renominated him\\n\", 'unanimously in 1840 and saw him go down to utter defeat.\\n', '\\n', '=The Whigs and General Harrison.=--By this time, the National\\n', 'Republicans, now known as Whigs--a title taken from the party of\\n', 'opposition to the Crown in England, had learned many lessons. Taking a\\n', 'leaf out of the Democratic book, they nominated, not Clay of Kentucky,\\n', 'well known for his views on the bank, the tariff, and internal\\n', 'improvements, but a military hero, General William Henry Harrison, a man\\n', 'of uncertain political opinions. Harrison, a son of a Virginia signer of\\n', 'the Declaration of Independence, sprang into public view by winning a\\n', 'battle more famous than important, \"Tippecanoe\"--a brush with the\\n', 'Indians in Indiana. He added to his laurels by rendering praiseworthy\\n', 'services during the war of 1812. When days of peace returned he was\\n', 'rewarded by a grateful people with a seat in Congress. Then he retired\\n', 'to quiet life in a little village near Cincinnati. Like Jackson he was\\n', 'held to be a son of the South and the West. Like Jackson he was a\\n', 'military hero, a lesser light, but still a light. Like Old Hickory he\\n', 'rode into office on a tide of popular feeling against an Eastern man\\n', 'accused of being something of an aristocrat. His personal popularity was\\n', 'sufficient. The Whigs who nominated him shrewdly refused to adopt a\\n', 'platform or declare their belief in anything. When some Democrat\\n', 'asserted that Harrison was a backwoodsman whose sole wants were a jug of\\n', 'hard cider and a log cabin, the Whigs treated the remark not as an\\n', 'insult but as proof positive that Harrison deserved the votes of Jackson\\n', 'men. The jug and the cabin they proudly transformed into symbols of the\\n', 'campaign, and won for their chieftain 234 electoral votes, while Van\\n', 'Buren got only sixty.\\n', '\\n', '=Harrison and Tyler.=--The Hero of Tippecanoe was not long to enjoy the\\n', 'fruits of his victory. The hungry horde of Whig office seekers descended\\n', 'upon him like wolves upon the fold. If he went out they waylaid him; if\\n', 'he stayed indoors, he was besieged; not even his bed chamber was spared.\\n', 'He was none too strong at best and he took a deep cold on the day of his\\n', 'inauguration. Between driving out Democrats and appeasing Whigs, he fell\\n', 'mortally ill. Before the end of a month he lay dead at the capitol.\\n', '\\n', \"Harrison's successor, John Tyler, the Vice President, whom the Whigs had\\n\", 'nominated to catch votes in Virginia, was more of a Democrat than\\n', 'anything else, though he was not partisan enough to please anybody. The\\n', 'Whigs railed at him because he would not approve the founding of another\\n', 'United States Bank. The Democrats stormed at him for refusing, until\\n', 'near the end of his term, to sanction the annexation of Texas, which had\\n', 'declared its independence of Mexico in 1836. His entire administration,\\n', 'marked by unseemly wrangling, produced only two measures of importance.\\n', 'The Whigs, flushed by victory, with the aid of a few protectionist\\n', 'Democrats, enacted, in 1842, a new tariff law destroying the compromise\\n', 'which had brought about the truce between the North and the South, in\\n', 'the days of nullification. The distinguished leader of the Whigs, Daniel\\n', 'Webster, as Secretary of State, in negotiation with Lord Ashburton\\n', 'representing Great Britain, settled the long-standing dispute between\\n', 'the two countries over the Maine boundary. A year after closing this\\n', 'chapter in American diplomacy, Webster withdrew to private life, leaving\\n', 'the President to endure alone the buffets of political fortune.\\n', '\\n', 'To the end, the Whigs regarded Tyler as a traitor to their cause; but\\n', 'the judgment of history is that it was a case of the biter bitten. They\\n', 'had nominated him for the vice presidency as a man of views acceptable\\n', 'to Southern Democrats in order to catch their votes, little reckoning\\n', 'with the chances of his becoming President. Tyler had not deceived them\\n', 'and, thoroughly soured, he left the White House in 1845 not to appear in\\n', 'public life again until the days of secession, when he espoused the\\n', 'Southern confederacy. Jacksonian Democracy, with new leadership, serving\\n', 'a new cause--slavery--was returned to power under James K. Polk, a\\n', 'friend of the General from Tennessee. A few grains of sand were to run\\n', 'through the hour glass before the Whig party was to be broken and\\n', 'scattered as the Federalists had been more than a generation before.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE INTERACTION OF AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN OPINION\\n', '\\n', '=Democracy in England and France.=--During the period of Jacksonian\\n', 'Democracy, as in all epochs of ferment, there was a close relation\\n', 'between the thought of the New World and the Old. In England, the\\n', 'successes of the American experiment were used as arguments in favor of\\n', 'overthrowing the aristocracy which George III had manipulated with such\\n', 'effect against America half a century before. In the United States, on\\n', 'the other hand, conservatives like Chancellor Kent, the stout opponent\\n', 'of manhood suffrage in New York, cited the riots of the British working\\n', 'classes as a warning against admitting the same classes to a share in\\n', 'the government of the United States. Along with the agitation of opinion\\n', \"went epoch-making events. In 1832, the year of Jackson's second\\n\", 'triumph, the British Parliament passed its first reform bill, which\\n', 'conferred the ballot--not on workingmen as yet--but on mill owners and\\n', 'shopkeepers whom the landlords regarded with genuine horror. The initial\\n', 'step was thus taken in breaking down the privileges of the landed\\n', 'aristocracy and the rich merchants of England.\\n', '\\n', 'About the same time a popular revolution occurred in France. The Bourbon\\n', 'family, restored to the throne of France by the allied powers after\\n', 'their victory over Napoleon in 1815, had embarked upon a policy of\\n', 'arbitrary government. To use the familiar phrase, they had learned\\n', 'nothing and forgotten nothing. Charles X, who came to the throne in\\n', '1824, set to work with zeal to undo the results of the French\\n', 'Revolution, to stifle the press, restrict the suffrage, and restore the\\n', 'clergy and the nobility to their ancient rights. His policy encountered\\n', 'equally zealous opposition and in 1830 he was overthrown. The popular\\n', 'party, under the leadership of Lafayette, established, not a republic as\\n', 'some of the radicals had hoped, but a \"liberal\" middle-class monarchy\\n', 'under Louis Philippe. This second French Revolution made a profound\\n', 'impression on Americans, convincing them that the whole world was moving\\n', 'toward democracy. The mayor, aldermen, and citizens of New York City\\n', 'joined in a great parade to celebrate the fall of the Bourbons. Mingled\\n', 'with cheers for the new order in France were hurrahs for \"the people\\'s\\n', 'own, Andrew Jackson, the Hero of New Orleans and President of the United\\n', 'States!\"\\n', '\\n', '=European Interest in America.=--To the older and more settled\\n', 'Europeans, the democratic experiment in America was either a menace or\\n', 'an inspiration. Conservatives viewed it with anxiety; liberals with\\n', 'optimism. Far-sighted leaders could see that the tide of democracy was\\n', 'rising all over the world and could not be stayed. Naturally the country\\n', 'that had advanced furthest along the new course was the place in which\\n', 'to find arguments for and against proposals that Europe should make\\n', 'experiments of the same character.\\n', '\\n', \"=De Tocqueville's _Democracy in America_.=--In addition to the casual\\n\", 'traveler there began to visit the United States the thoughtful observer\\n', 'bent on finding out what manner of nation this was springing up in the\\n', 'wilderness. Those who looked with sympathy upon the growing popular\\n', 'forces of England and France found in the United States, in spite of\\n', \"many blemishes and defects, a guarantee for the future of the people's\\n\", 'rule in the Old World. One of these, Alexis de Tocqueville, a French\\n', 'liberal of mildly democratic sympathies, made a journey to this country\\n', 'in 1831; he described in a very remarkable volume, _Democracy in\\n', 'America_, the grand experiment as he saw it. On the whole he was\\n', 'convinced. After examining with a critical eye the life and labor of the\\n', 'American people, as well as the constitutions of the states and the\\n', 'nation, he came to the conclusion that democracy with all its faults was\\n', 'both inevitable and successful. Slavery he thought was a painful\\n', 'contrast to the other features of American life, and he foresaw what\\n', 'proved to be the irrepressible conflict over it. He believed that\\n', 'through blundering the people were destined to learn the highest of all\\n', 'arts, self-government on a grand scale. The absence of a leisure class,\\n', 'devoted to no calling or profession, merely enjoying the refinements of\\n', 'life and adding to its graces--the flaw in American culture that gave\\n', 'deep distress to many a European leader--de Tocqueville thought a\\n', 'necessary virtue in the republic. \"Amongst a democratic people where\\n', 'there is no hereditary wealth, every man works to earn a living, or has\\n', 'worked, or is born of parents who have worked. A notion of labor is\\n', 'therefore presented to the mind on every side as the necessary, natural,\\n', 'and honest condition of human existence.\" It was this notion of a\\n', 'government in the hands of people who labored that struck the French\\n', 'publicist as the most significant fact in the modern world.\\n', '\\n', \"=Harriet Martineau's Visit to America.=--This phase of American life\\n\", 'also profoundly impressed the brilliant English writer, Harriet\\n', 'Martineau. She saw all parts of the country, the homes of the rich and\\n', 'the log cabins of the frontier; she traveled in stagecoaches, canal\\n', 'boats, and on horseback; and visited sessions of Congress and auctions\\n', 'at slave markets. She tried to view the country impartially and the\\n', 'thing that left the deepest mark on her mind was the solidarity of the\\n', 'people in one great political body. \"However various may be the tribes\\n', 'of inhabitants in those states, whatever part of the world may have been\\n', 'their birthplace, or that of their fathers, however broken may be their\\n', 'language, however servile or noble their employments, however exalted or\\n', 'despised their state, all are declared to be bound together by equal\\n', 'political obligations.... In that self-governing country all are held to\\n', 'have an equal interest in the principles of its institutions and to be\\n', 'bound in equal duty to watch their workings.\" Miss Martineau was also\\n', 'impressed with the passion of Americans for land ownership and\\n', 'contrasted the United States favorably with England where the tillers of\\n', 'the soil were either tenants or laborers for wages.\\n', '\\n', '=Adverse Criticism.=--By no means all observers and writers were\\n', 'convinced that America was a success. The fastidious traveler, Mrs.\\n', 'Trollope, who thought the English system of church and state was ideal,\\n', 'saw in the United States only roughness and ignorance. She lamented the\\n', '\"total and universal want of manners both in males and females,\" adding\\n', 'that while \"they appear to have clear heads and active intellects,\"\\n', 'there was \"no charm, no grace in their conversation.\" She found\\n', 'everywhere a lack of reverence for kings, learning, and rank. Other\\n', 'critics were even more savage. The editor of the _Foreign Quarterly_\\n', 'petulantly exclaimed that the United States was \"a brigand\\n', 'confederation.\" Charles Dickens declared the country to be \"so maimed\\n', 'and lame, so full of sores and ulcers that her best friends turn from\\n', 'the loathsome creature in disgust.\" Sydney Smith, editor of the\\n', '_Edinburgh Review_, was never tired of trying his caustic wit at the\\n', 'expense of America. \"Their Franklins and Washingtons and all the other\\n', 'sages and heroes of their revolution were born and bred subjects of the\\n', 'king of England,\" he observed in 1820. \"During the thirty or forty\\n', 'years of their independence they have done absolutely nothing for the\\n', 'sciences, for the arts, for literature, or even for the statesmanlike\\n', 'studies of politics or political economy.... In the four quarters of the\\n', 'globe who reads an American book? Or goes to an American play? Or looks\\n', 'at an American picture or statue?\" To put a sharp sting into his taunt\\n', 'he added, forgetting by whose authority slavery was introduced and\\n', 'fostered: \"Under which of the old tyrannical governments of Europe is\\n', 'every sixth man a slave whom his fellow creatures may buy and sell?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Some Americans, while resenting the hasty and often superficial\\n', 'judgments of European writers, winced under their satire and took\\n', 'thought about certain particulars in the indictments brought against\\n', 'them. The mass of the people, however, bent on the great experiment,\\n', 'gave little heed to carping critics who saw the flaws and not the\\n', 'achievements of our country--critics who were in fact less interested in\\n', 'America than in preventing the rise and growth of democracy in Europe.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', 'J.S.

When he made this astounding declaration, he doubtless had\\n', \"before his mind's eye the great stretches of unoccupied lands between\\n\", 'the Appalachians and the Mississippi. He also had before him the history\\n', 'of the English colonies, which told him of the two centuries required to\\n', 'settle the seaboard region. To practical men, his prophecy did not seem\\n', 'far wrong; but before the lapse of half that time there appeared beyond\\n', 'the Mississippi a tier of new states, reaching from the Gulf of Mexico\\n', 'to the southern boundary of Minnesota, and a new commonwealth on the\\n', 'Pacific Ocean where American emigrants had raised the Bear flag of\\n', 'California.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE ADVANCE OF THE MIDDLE BORDER\\n', '\\n', '=Missouri.=--When the middle of the nineteenth century had been reached,\\n', 'the Mississippi River, which Daniel Boone, the intrepid hunter, had\\n', 'crossed during Washington\\'s administration \"to escape from civilization\"\\n', 'in Kentucky, had become the waterway for a vast empire. The center of\\n', 'population of the United States had passed to the Ohio Valley. Missouri,\\n', 'with its wide reaches of rich lands, low-lying, level, and fertile, well\\n', 'adapted to hemp raising, had drawn to its borders thousands of planters\\n', 'from the old Southern states--from Virginia and the Carolinas as well as\\n', 'from Kentucky and Tennessee. When the great compromise of 1820-21\\n', 'admitted her to the union, wearing \"every jewel of sovereignty,\" as a\\n', 'florid orator announced, migratory slave owners were assured that their\\n', 'property would be safe in Missouri. Along the western shore of the\\n', 'Mississippi and on both banks of the Missouri to the uttermost limits of\\n', 'the state, plantations tilled by bondmen spread out in broad expanses.\\n', 'In the neighborhood of Jefferson City the slaves numbered more than a\\n', 'fourth of the population.\\n', '\\n', 'Into this stream of migration from the planting South flowed another\\n', 'current of land-tilling farmers; some from Kentucky, Tennessee, and\\n', 'Mississippi, driven out by the onrush of the planters buying and\\n', 'consolidating small farms into vast estates; and still more from the\\n', 'East and the Old World. To the northwest over against Iowa and to the\\n', 'southwest against Arkansas, these yeomen laid out farms to be tilled by\\n', 'their own labor. In those regions the number of slaves seldom rose above\\n', 'five or six per cent of the population. The old French post, St. Louis,\\n', 'enriched by the fur trade of the Far West and the steamboat traffic of\\n', 'the river, grew into a thriving commercial city, including among its\\n', 'seventy-five thousand inhabitants in 1850 nearly forty thousand\\n', 'foreigners, German immigrants from Pennsylvania and Europe being the\\n', 'largest single element.\\n', '\\n', '=Arkansas.=--Below Missouri lay the territory of Arkansas, which had\\n', 'long been the paradise of the swarthy hunter and the restless\\n', 'frontiersman fleeing from the advancing borders of farm and town. In\\n', 'search of the life, wild and free, where the rifle supplied the game and\\n', 'a few acres of ground the corn and potatoes, they had filtered into the\\n', 'territory in an unending drift, \"squatting\" on the land. Without so much\\n', 'as asking the leave of any government, territorial or national, they\\n', 'claimed as their own the soil on which they first planted their feet.\\n', 'Like the Cherokee Indians, whom they had as neighbors, whose very\\n', 'customs and dress they sometimes adopted, the squatters spent their days\\n', 'in the midst of rough plenty, beset by chills, fevers, and the ills of\\n', 'the flesh, but for many years unvexed by political troubles or the\\n', 'restrictions of civilized life.\\n', '\\n', 'Unfortunately for them, however, the fertile valleys of the Mississippi\\n', 'and Arkansas were well adapted to the cultivation of cotton and tobacco\\n', 'and their sylvan peace was soon broken by an invasion of planters. The\\n', 'newcomers, with their servile workers, spread upward in the valley\\n', 'toward Missouri and along the southern border westward to the Red River.\\n', 'In time the slaves in the tier of counties against Louisiana ranged from\\n', 'thirty to seventy per cent of the population. This marked the doom of\\n', 'the small farmer, swept Arkansas into the main current of planting\\n', 'politics, and led to a powerful lobby at Washington in favor of\\n', 'admission to the union, a boon granted in 1836.\\n', '\\n', '=Michigan.=--In accordance with a well-established custom, a free state\\n', 'was admitted to the union to balance a slave state. In 1833, the people\\n', 'of Michigan, a territory ten times the size of Connecticut, announced\\n', 'that the time had come for them to enjoy the privileges of a\\n', 'commonwealth. All along the southern border the land had been occupied\\n', 'largely by pioneers from New England, who built prim farmhouses and\\n', 'adopted the town-meeting plan of self-government after the fashion of\\n', 'the old home. The famous post of Detroit was growing into a flourishing\\n', 'city as the boats plying on the Great Lakes carried travelers, settlers,\\n', 'and freight through the narrows. In all, according to the census, there\\n', 'were more than ninety thousand inhabitants in the territory; so it was\\n', 'not without warrant that they clamored for statehood. Congress, busy as\\n', 'ever with politics, delayed; and the inhabitants of Michigan, unable to\\n', 'restrain their impatience, called a convention, drew up a constitution,\\n', 'and started a lively quarrel with Ohio over the southern boundary. The\\n', 'hand of Congress was now forced. Objections were made to the new\\n', 'constitution on the ground that it gave the ballot to all free white\\n', 'males, including aliens not yet naturalized; but the protests were\\n', 'overborne in a long debate. The boundary was fixed, and Michigan, though\\n', 'shorn of some of the land she claimed, came into the union in 1837.\\n', '\\n', '=Wisconsin.=--Across Lake Michigan to the west lay the territory of\\n', 'Wisconsin, which shared with Michigan the interesting history of the\\n', 'Northwest, running back into the heroic days when French hunters and\\n', 'missionaries were planning a French empire for the great monarch, Louis\\n', 'XIV. It will not be forgotten that the French rangers of the woods, the\\n', 'black-robed priests, prepared for sacrifice, even to death, the trappers\\n', 'of the French agencies, and the French explorers--Marquette, Joliet, and\\n', 'Menard--were the first white men to paddle their frail barks through the\\n', 'northern waters. They first blazed their trails into the black forests\\n', 'and left traces of their work in the names of portages and little\\n', 'villages. It was from these forests that Red Men in full war paint\\n', 'journeyed far to fight under the _fleur-de-lis_ of France when the\\n', 'soldiers of King Louis made their last stand at Quebec and Montreal\\n', 'against the imperial arms of Britain. It was here that the British flag\\n', 'was planted in 1761 and that the great Pontiac conspiracy was formed two\\n', 'years later to overthrow British dominion.\\n', '\\n', 'When, a generation afterward, the Stars and Stripes supplanted the Union\\n', 'Jack, the French were still almost the only white men in the region.\\n', 'They were soon joined by hustling Yankee fur traders who did battle\\n', 'royal against British interlopers. The traders cut their way through\\n', 'forest trails and laid out the routes through lake and stream and over\\n', 'portages for the settlers and their families from the states \"back\\n', 'East.\" It was the forest ranger who discovered the water power later\\n', 'used to turn the busy mills grinding the grain from the spreading farm\\n', 'lands. In the wake of the fur hunters, forest men, and farmers came\\n', 'miners from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri crowding in to exploit the\\n', 'lead ores of the northwest, some of them bringing slaves to work their\\n', 'claims. Had it not been for the gold fever of 1849 that drew the\\n', 'wielders of pick and shovel to the Far West, Wisconsin would early have\\n', 'taken high rank among the mining regions of the country.\\n', '\\n', 'From a favorable point of vantage on Lake Michigan, the village of\\n', 'Milwaukee, a center for lumber and grain transport and a place of entry\\n', 'for Eastern goods, grew into a thriving city. It claimed twenty thousand\\n', 'inhabitants, when in 1848 Congress admitted Wisconsin to the union.\\n', 'Already the Germans, Irish, and Scandinavians had found their way into\\n', 'the territory. They joined Americans from the older states in clearing\\n', 'forests, building roads, transforming trails into highways, erecting\\n', 'mills, and connecting streams with canals to make a network of routes\\n', 'for the traffic that poured to and from the Great Lakes.\\n', '\\n', '=Iowa and Minnesota.=--To the southwest of Wisconsin beyond the\\n', 'Mississippi, where the tall grass of the prairies waved like the sea,\\n', 'farmers from New England, New York, and Ohio had prepared Iowa for\\n', 'statehood. A tide of immigration that might have flowed into Missouri\\n', 'went northward; for freemen, unaccustomed to slavery and slave markets,\\n', 'preferred the open country above the compromise line. With incredible\\n', 'swiftness, they spread farms westward from the Mississippi. With Yankee\\n', 'ingenuity they turned to trading on the river, building before 1836\\n', 'three prosperous centers of traffic: Dubuque, Davenport, and Burlington.\\n', 'True to their old traditions, they founded colleges and academies that\\n', 'religion and learning might be cherished on the frontier as in the\\n', 'states from which they came. Prepared for self-government, the Iowans\\n', 'laid siege to the door of Congress and were admitted to the union in\\n', '1846.\\n', '\\n', 'Above Iowa, on the Mississippi, lay the territory of Minnesota--the home\\n', 'of the Dakotas, the Ojibways, and the Sioux. Like Michigan and\\n', 'Wisconsin, it had been explored early by the French scouts, and the\\n', 'first white settlement was the little French village of Mendota. To the\\n', 'people of the United States, the resources of the country were first\\n', 'revealed by the historic journey of Zebulon Pike in 1805 and by American\\n', 'fur traders who were quick to take advantage of the opportunity to ply\\n', 'their arts of hunting and bartering in fresh fields. In 1839 an\\n', 'American settlement was planted at Marina on the St. Croix, the outpost\\n', 'of advancing civilization. Within twenty years, the territory, boasting\\n', 'a population of 150,000, asked for admission to the union. In 1858 the\\n', 'plea was granted and Minnesota showed her gratitude three years later by\\n', 'being first among the states to offer troops to Lincoln in the hour of\\n', 'peril.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'ON TO THE PACIFIC--TEXAS AND THE MEXICAN WAR\\n', '\\n', '=The Uniformity of the Middle West.=--There was a certain monotony about\\n', 'pioneering in the Northwest and on the middle border. As the long\\n', 'stretches of land were cleared or prepared for the plow, they were laid\\n', 'out like checkerboards into squares of forty, eighty, one hundred sixty,\\n', 'or more acres, each the seat of a homestead. There was a striking\\n', 'uniformity also about the endless succession of fertile fields spreading\\n', 'far and wide under the hot summer sun. No majestic mountains relieved\\n', 'the sweep of the prairie. Few monuments of other races and antiquity\\n', 'were there to awaken curiosity about the region. No sonorous bells in\\n', 'old missions rang out the time of day. The chaffering Red Man bartering\\n', 'blankets and furs for powder and whisky had passed farther on. The\\n', 'population was made up of plain farmers and their families engaged in\\n', 'severe and unbroken labor, chopping down trees, draining fever-breeding\\n', 'swamps, breaking new ground, and planting from year to year the same\\n', 'rotation of crops. Nearly all the settlers were of native American stock\\n', 'into whose frugal and industrious lives the later Irish and German\\n', 'immigrants fitted, on the whole, with little friction. Even the Dutch\\n', 'oven fell before the cast-iron cooking stove. Happiness and sorrow,\\n', 'despair and hope were there, but all encompassed by the heavy tedium of\\n', 'prosaic sameness.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: SANTA BARBARA MISSION]\\n', '\\n', '=A Contrast in the Far West and Southwest.=--As George Rogers Clark and\\n', 'Daniel Boone had stirred the snug Americans of the seaboard to seek\\n', 'their fortunes beyond the Appalachians, so now Kit Carson, James Bowie,\\n', 'Sam Houston, Davy Crockett, and John C. Fremont were to lead the way\\n', 'into a new land, only a part of which was under the American flag. The\\n', 'setting for this new scene in the westward movement was thrown out in a\\n', 'wide sweep from the headwaters of the Mississippi to the banks of the\\n', 'Rio Grande; from the valleys of the Sabine and Red rivers to Montana and\\n', 'the Pacific slope. In comparison with the middle border, this region\\n', 'presented such startling diversities that only the eye of faith could\\n', 'foresee the unifying power of nationalism binding its communities with\\n', 'the older sections of the country. What contrasts indeed! The blue grass\\n', 'region of Kentucky or the rich, black soil of Illinois--the painted\\n', 'desert, the home of the sage brush and the coyote! The level prairies of\\n', 'Iowa--the mighty Rockies shouldering themselves high against the\\n', 'horizon! The long bleak winters of Wisconsin--California of endless\\n', 'summer! The log churches of Indiana or Illinois--the quaint missions of\\n', 'San Antonio, Tucson, and Santa Barbara! The little state of\\n', 'Delaware--the empire of Texas, one hundred and twenty times its area!\\n', 'And scattered about through the Southwest were signs of an ancient\\n', 'civilization--fragments of four-and five-story dwellings, ruined dams,\\n', 'aqueducts, and broken canals, which told of once prosperous peoples\\n', 'who, by art and science, had conquered the aridity of the desert and\\n', 'lifted themselves in the scale of culture above the savages of the\\n', 'plain.\\n', '\\n', 'The settlers of this vast empire were to be as diverse in their origins\\n', 'and habits as those of the colonies on the coast had been. Americans of\\n', 'English, Irish, and Scotch-Irish descent came as usual from the Eastern\\n', 'states. To them were added the migratory Germans as well. Now for the\\n', 'first time came throngs of Scandinavians. Some were to make their homes\\n', 'on quiet farms as the border advanced against the setting sun. Others\\n', 'were to be Indian scouts, trappers, fur hunters, miners, cowboys, Texas\\n', 'planters, keepers of lonely posts on the plain and the desert, stage\\n', 'drivers, pilots of wagon trains, pony riders, fruit growers, \"lumber\\n', 'jacks,\" and smelter workers. One common bond united them--a passion for\\n', 'the self-government accorded to states. As soon as a few thousand\\n', 'settlers came together in a single territory, there arose a mighty shout\\n', 'for a position beside the staid commonwealths of the East and the South.\\n', 'Statehood meant to the pioneers self-government, dignity, and the right\\n', 'to dispose of land, minerals, and timber in their own way. In the quest\\n', 'for this local autonomy there arose many a wordy contest in Congress,\\n', 'each of the political parties lending a helping hand in the admission of\\n', 'a state when it gave promise of adding new congressmen of the \"right\\n', 'political persuasion,\" to use the current phrase.\\n', '\\n', '=Southern Planters and Texas.=--While the farmers of the North found the\\n', 'broad acres of the Western prairies stretching on before them apparently\\n', 'in endless expanse, it was far different with the Southern planters.\\n', 'Ever active in their search for new fields as they exhausted the virgin\\n', 'soil of the older states, the restless subjects of King Cotton quickly\\n', 'reached the frontier of Louisiana. There they paused; but only for a\\n', 'moment. The fertile land of Texas just across the boundary lured them on\\n', 'and the Mexican republic to which it belonged extended to them a more\\n', 'than generous welcome. Little realizing the perils lurking in a\\n', '\"peaceful penetration,\" the authorities at Mexico City opened wide the\\n', 'doors and made large grants of land to American contractors, who agreed\\n', 'to bring a number of families into Texas. The omnipresent Yankee, in the\\n', 'person of Moses Austin of Connecticut, hearing of this good news in the\\n', 'Southwest, obtained a grant in 1820 to settle three hundred Americans\\n', 'near Bexar--a commission finally carried out to the letter by his son\\n', 'and celebrated in the name given to the present capital of the state of\\n', 'Texas. Within a decade some twenty thousand Americans had crossed the\\n', 'border.\\n', '\\n', '=Mexico Closes the Door.=--The government of Mexico, unaccustomed to\\n', 'such enterprise and thoroughly frightened by its extent, drew back in\\n', 'dismay. Its fears were increased as quarrels broke out between the\\n', 'Americans and the natives in Texas. Fear grew into consternation when\\n', 'efforts were made by President Jackson to buy the territory for the\\n', 'United States. Mexico then sought to close the flood gates. It stopped\\n', 'all American colonization schemes, canceled many of the land grants, put\\n', 'a tariff on farming implements, and abolished slavery. These barriers\\n', 'were raised too late. A call for help ran through the western border of\\n', 'the United States. The sentinels of the frontier answered. Davy\\n', 'Crockett, the noted frontiersman, bear hunter, and backwoods politician;\\n', 'James Bowie, the dexterous wielder of the knife that to this day bears\\n', 'his name; and Sam Houston, warrior and pioneer, rushed to the aid of\\n', 'their countrymen in Texas. Unacquainted with the niceties of diplomacy,\\n', 'impatient at the formalities of international law, they soon made it\\n', 'known that in spite of Mexican sovereignty they would be their own\\n', 'masters.\\n', '\\n', '=The Independence of Texas Declared.=--Numbering only about one-fourth\\n', 'of the population in Texas, they raised the standard of revolt in 1836\\n', 'and summoned a convention. Following in the footsteps of their\\n', 'ancestors, they issued a declaration of independence signed mainly by\\n', 'Americans from the slave states. Anticipating that the government of\\n', 'Mexico would not quietly accept their word of defiance as final, they\\n', 'dispatched a force to repel \"the invading army,\" as General Houston\\n', 'called the troops advancing under the command of Santa Ana, the Mexican\\n', 'president. A portion of the Texan soldiers took their stand in the\\n', 'Alamo, an old Spanish mission in the cottonwood trees in the town of San\\n', 'Antonio. Instead of obeying the order to blow up the mission and retire,\\n', 'they held their ground until they were completely surrounded and cut off\\n', 'from all help. Refusing to surrender, they fought to the bitter end, the\\n', 'last man falling a victim to the sword. Vengeance was swift. Within\\n', 'three months General Houston overwhelmed Santa Ana at the San Jacinto,\\n', 'taking him prisoner of war and putting an end to all hopes for the\\n', 'restoration of Mexican sovereignty over Texas.\\n', '\\n', 'The Lone Star Republic, with Houston at the head, then sought admission\\n', 'to the United States. This seemed at first an easy matter. All that was\\n', 'required to bring it about appeared to be a treaty annexing Texas to the\\n', 'union. Moreover, President Jackson, at the height of his popularity, had\\n', 'a warm regard for General Houston and, with his usual sympathy for rough\\n', 'and ready ways of doing things, approved the transaction. Through an\\n', 'American representative in Mexico, Jackson had long and anxiously\\n', 'labored, by means none too nice, to wring from the Mexican republic the\\n', 'cession of the coveted territory. When the Texans took matters into\\n', 'their own hands, he was more than pleased; but he could not marshal the\\n', 'approval of two-thirds of the Senators required for a treaty of\\n', 'annexation. Cautious as well as impetuous, Jackson did not press the\\n', 'issue; he went out of office in 1837 with Texas uncertain as to her\\n', 'future.\\n', '\\n', '=Northern Opposition to Annexation.=--All through the North the\\n', 'opposition to annexation was clear and strong. Anti-slavery agitators\\n', 'could hardly find words savage enough to express their feelings.\\n', '\"Texas,\" exclaimed Channing in a letter to Clay, \"is but the first step\\n', 'of aggression. I trust indeed that Providence will beat back and humble\\n', 'our cupidity and ambition. I now ask whether as a people we are\\n', 'prepared to seize on a neighboring territory for the end of extending\\n', 'slavery? I ask whether as a people we can stand forth in the sight of\\n', 'God, in the sight of nations, and adopt this atrocious policy? Sooner\\n', 'perish! Sooner be our name blotted out from the record of nations!\"\\n', 'William Lloyd Garrison called for the secession of the Northern states\\n', 'if Texas was brought into the union with slavery. John Quincy Adams\\n', 'warned his countrymen that they were treading in the path of the\\n', 'imperialism that had brought the nations of antiquity to judgment and\\n', 'destruction. Henry Clay, the Whig candidate for President, taking into\\n', 'account changing public sentiment, blew hot and cold, losing the state\\n', 'of New York and the election of 1844 by giving a qualified approval of\\n', 'annexation. In the same campaign, the Democrats boldly demanded the\\n', '\"Reannexation of Texas,\" based on claims which the United States once\\n', 'had to Spanish territory beyond the Sabine River.\\n', '\\n', '=Annexation.=--The politicians were disposed to walk very warily. Van\\n', 'Buren, at heart opposed to slavery extension, refused to press the issue\\n', 'of annexation. Tyler, a pro-slavery Democrat from Virginia, by a strange\\n', 'fling of fortune carried into office as a nominal Whig, kept his mind\\n', 'firmly fixed on the idea of reelection and let the troublesome matter\\n', 'rest until the end of his administration was in sight. He then listened\\n', 'with favor to the voice of the South. Calhoun stated what seemed to be a\\n', 'convincing argument: All good Americans have their hearts set on the\\n', 'Constitution; the admission of Texas is absolutely essential to the\\n', 'preservation of the union; it will give a balance of power to the South\\n', 'as against the North growing with incredible swiftness in wealth and\\n', 'population. Tyler, impressed by the plea, appointed Calhoun to the\\n', 'office of Secretary of State in 1844, authorizing him to negotiate the\\n', 'treaty of annexation--a commission at once executed. This scheme was\\n', 'blocked in the Senate where the necessary two-thirds vote could not be\\n', 'secured. Balked but not defeated, the advocates of annexation drew up a\\n', 'joint resolution which required only a majority vote in both houses,\\n', 'and in February of the next year, just before Tyler gave way to Polk,\\n', 'they pushed it through Congress. So Texas, amid the groans of Boston and\\n', 'the hurrahs of Charleston, folded up her flag and came into the union.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: TEXAS AND THE TERRITORY IN DISPUTE]\\n', '\\n', '=The Mexican War.=--The inevitable war with Mexico, foretold by the\\n', 'abolitionists and feared by Henry Clay, ensued, the ostensible cause\\n', 'being a dispute over the boundaries of the new state. The Texans claimed\\n', 'all the lands down to the Rio Grande. The Mexicans placed the border of\\n', 'Texas at the Nueces River and a line drawn thence in a northerly\\n', 'direction. President Polk, accepting the Texan view of the controversy,\\n', 'ordered General Zachary Taylor to move beyond the Nueces in defense of\\n', 'American sovereignty. This act of power, deemed by the Mexicans an\\n', 'invasion of their territory, was followed by an attack on our troops.\\n', '\\n', 'President Polk, not displeased with the turn of events, announced that\\n', 'American blood had been \"spilled on American soil\" and that war existed\\n', '\"by the act of Mexico.\" Congress, in a burst of patriotic fervor,\\n', 'brushed aside the protests of those who deplored the conduct of the\\n', 'government as wanton aggression on a weaker nation and granted money and\\n', 'supplies to prosecute the war. The few Whigs in the House of\\n', 'Representatives, who refused to vote in favor of taking up arms,\\n', 'accepted the inevitable with such good grace as they could command. All\\n', 'through the South and the West the war was popular. New England\\n', 'grumbled, but gave loyal, if not enthusiastic, support to a conflict\\n', 'precipitated by policies not of its own choosing. Only a handful of firm\\n', 'objectors held out. James Russell Lowell, in his _Biglow Papers_, flung\\n', 'scorn and sarcasm to the bitter end.\\n', '\\n', '=The Outcome of the War.=--The foregone conclusion was soon reached.\\n', 'General Taylor might have delivered the fatal thrust from northern\\n', 'Mexico if politics had not intervened. Polk, anxious to avoid raising up\\n', 'another military hero for the Whigs to nominate for President, decided\\n', 'to divide the honors by sending General Scott to strike a blow at the\\n', 'capital, Mexico City. The deed was done with speed and pomp and two\\n', 'heroes were lifted into presidential possibilities. In the Far West a\\n', 'third candidate was made, John C. Fremont, who, in cooperation with\\n', 'Commodores Sloat and Stockton and General Kearney, planted the Stars and\\n', 'Stripes on the Pacific slope.\\n', '\\n', 'In February, 1848, the Mexicans came to terms, ceding to the victor\\n', 'California, Arizona, New Mexico, and more--a domain greater in extent\\n', 'than the combined areas of France and Germany. As a salve to the wound,\\n', 'the vanquished received fifteen million dollars in cash and the\\n', 'cancellation of many claims held by American citizens. Five years later,\\n', 'through the negotiations of James Gadsden, a further cession of lands\\n', 'along the southern border of Arizona and New Mexico was secured on\\n', 'payment of ten million dollars.\\n', '\\n', '=General Taylor Elected President.=--The ink was hardly dry upon the\\n', 'treaty that closed the war before \"rough and ready\" General Taylor, a\\n', 'slave owner from Louisiana, \"a Whig,\" as he said, \"but not an ultra\\n', 'Whig,\" was put forward as the Whig candidate for President. He himself\\n', 'had not voted for years and he was fairly innocent in matters political.\\n', 'The tariff, the currency, and internal improvements, with a magnificent\\n', \"gesture he referred to the people's representatives in Congress,\\n\", \"offering to enforce the laws as made, if elected. Clay's followers\\n\", 'mourned. Polk stormed but could not win even a renomination at the hands\\n', 'of the Democrats. So it came about that the hero of Buena Vista,\\n', 'celebrated for his laconic order, \"Give \\'em a little more grape, Captain\\n', 'Bragg,\" became President of the United States.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE PACIFIC COAST AND UTAH\\n', '\\n', '=Oregon.=--Closely associated in the popular mind with the contest about\\n', 'the affairs of Texas was a dispute with Great Britain over the\\n', 'possession of territory in Oregon. In their presidential campaign of\\n', '1844, the Democrats had coupled with the slogan, \"The Reannexation of\\n', 'Texas,\" two other cries, \"The Reoccupation of Oregon,\" and \"Fifty-four\\n', 'Forty or Fight.\" The last two slogans were founded on American\\n', 'discoveries and explorations in the Far Northwest. Their appearance in\\n', 'politics showed that the distant Oregon country, larger in area than New\\n', 'England, New York, and Pennsylvania combined, was at last receiving from\\n', 'the nation the attention which its importance warranted.\\n', '\\n', '_Joint Occupation and Settlement._--Both England and the United States\\n', 'had long laid claim to Oregon and in 1818 they had agreed to occupy the\\n', 'territory jointly--a contract which was renewed ten years later for an\\n', 'indefinite period. Under this plan, citizens of both countries were free\\n', 'to hunt and settle anywhere in the region. The vanguard of British fur\\n', 'traders and Canadian priests was enlarged by many new recruits, with\\n', 'Americans not far behind them. John Jacob Astor, the resourceful New\\n', 'York merchant, sent out trappers and hunters who established a trading\\n', 'post at Astoria in 1811. Some twenty years later, American\\n', 'missionaries--among them two very remarkable men, Jason Lee and Marcus\\n', 'Whitman--were preaching the gospel to the Indians.\\n', '\\n', 'Through news from the fur traders and missionaries, Eastern farmers\\n', 'heard of the fertile lands awaiting their plows on the Pacific slope;\\n', 'those with the pioneering spirit made ready to take possession of the\\n', 'new country. In 1839 a band went around by Cape Horn. Four years later a\\n', 'great expedition went overland. The way once broken, others followed\\n', 'rapidly. As soon as a few settlements were well established, the\\n', 'pioneers held a mass meeting and agreed upon a plan of government. \"We,\\n', 'the people of Oregon territory,\" runs the preamble to their compact,\\n', '\"for the purposes of mutual protection and to secure peace and\\n', 'prosperity among ourselves, agree to adopt the following laws and\\n', 'regulations until such time as the United States of America extend their\\n', 'jurisdiction over us.\" Thus self-government made its way across the\\n', 'Rocky Mountains.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: THE OREGON COUNTRY AND THE DISPUTED BOUNDARY]\\n', '\\n', '_The Boundary Dispute with England Adjusted._--By this time it was\\n', 'evident that the boundaries of Oregon must be fixed. Having made the\\n', 'question an issue in his campaign, Polk, after his election in 1844,\\n', 'pressed it upon the attention of the country. In his inaugural address\\n', 'and his first message to Congress he reiterated the claim of the\\n', 'Democratic platform that \"our title to the whole territory of Oregon is\\n', 'clear and unquestionable.\" This pretension Great Britain firmly\\n', 'rejected, leaving the President a choice between war and compromise.\\n', '\\n', 'Polk, already having the contest with Mexico on his hands, sought and\\n', 'obtained a compromise. The British government, moved by a hint from the\\n', 'American minister, offered a settlement which would fix the boundary at\\n', 'the forty-ninth parallel instead of \"fifty-four forty,\" and give it\\n', 'Vancouver Island. Polk speedily chose this way out of the dilemma.\\n', 'Instead of making the decision himself, however, and drawing up a\\n', 'treaty, he turned to the Senate for \"counsel.\" As prearranged with party\\n', 'leaders, the advice was favorable to the plan. The treaty, duly drawn in\\n', '1846, was ratified by the Senate after an acrimonious debate. \"Oh!\\n', 'mountain that was delivered of a mouse,\" exclaimed Senator Benton, \"thy\\n', 'name shall be fifty-four forty!\" Thirteen years later, the southern part\\n', 'of the territory was admitted to the union as the state of Oregon,\\n', 'leaving the northern and eastern sections in the status of a territory.\\n', '\\n', '=California.=--With the growth of the northwestern empire, dedicated by\\n', 'nature to freedom, the planting interests might have been content, had\\n', 'fortune not wrested from them the fair country of California. Upon this\\n', 'huge territory they had set their hearts. The mild climate and fertile\\n', 'soil seemed well suited to slavery and the planters expected to extend\\n', 'their sway to the entire domain. California was a state of more than\\n', '155,000 square miles--about seventy times the size of the state of\\n', 'Delaware. It could readily be divided into five or six large states, if\\n', 'that became necessary to preserve the Southern balance of power.\\n', '\\n', '_Early American Relations with California._--Time and tide, it seems,\\n', 'were not on the side of the planters. Already Americans of a far\\n', 'different type were invading the Pacific slope. Long before Polk ever\\n', 'dreamed of California, the Yankee with his cargo of notions had been\\n', 'around the Horn. Daring skippers had sailed out of New England harbors\\n', 'with a variety of goods, bent their course around South America to\\n', 'California, on to China and around the world, trading as they went and\\n', 'leaving pots, pans, woolen cloth, guns, boots, shoes, salt fish, naval\\n', 'stores, and rum in their wake. \"Home from Californy!\" rang the cry in\\n', 'many a New England port as a good captain let go his anchor on his\\n', 'return from the long trading voyage in the Pacific.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: THE OVERLAND TRAILS]\\n', '\\n', '_The Overland Trails._--Not to be outdone by the mariners of the deep,\\n', 'western scouts searched for overland routes to the Pacific. Zebulon\\n', 'Pike, explorer and pathfinder, by his expedition into the Southwest\\n', \"during Jefferson's administration, had discovered the resources of New\\n\", 'Spain and had shown his countrymen how easy it was to reach Santa Fe\\n', 'from the upper waters of the Arkansas River. Not long afterward, traders\\n', 'laid open the route, making Franklin, Missouri, and later Fort\\n', 'Leavenworth the starting point. Along the trail, once surveyed, poured\\n', 'caravans heavily guarded by armed men against marauding Indians. Sand\\n', 'storms often wiped out all signs of the route; hunger and thirst did\\n', 'many a band of wagoners to death; but the lure of the game and the\\n', 'profits at the end kept the business thriving. Huge stocks of cottons,\\n', 'glass, hardware, and ammunition were drawn almost across the continent\\n', 'to be exchanged at Santa Fe for furs, Indian blankets, silver, and\\n', 'mules; and many a fortune was made out of the traffic.\\n', '\\n', '_Americans in California._--Why stop at Santa Fe? The question did not\\n', 'long remain unanswered. In 1829, Ewing Young broke the path to Los\\n', 'Angeles. Thirteen years later Fremont made the first of his celebrated\\n', 'expeditions across plain, desert, and mountain, arousing the interest of\\n', 'the entire country in the Far West. In the wake of the pathfinders went\\n', 'adventurers, settlers, and artisans. By 1847, more than one-fifth of the\\n', 'inhabitants in the little post of two thousand on San Francisco Bay were\\n', 'from the United States. The Mexican War, therefore, was not the\\n', 'beginning but the end of the American conquest of California--a conquest\\n', 'initiated by Americans who went to till the soil, to trade, or to follow\\n', 'some mechanical pursuit.\\n', '\\n', '_The Discovery of Gold._--As if to clinch the hold on California already\\n', 'secured by the friends of free soil, there came in 1848 the sudden\\n', \"discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in the Sacramento Valley.

Before\\n', 'two years had passed, it is estimated that a hundred thousand people, in\\n', 'search of fortunes, had arrived in California--mechanics, teachers,\\n', 'doctors, lawyers, farmers, miners, and laborers from the four corners of\\n', 'the earth.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', 'SAN FRANCISCO IN 1849]\\n', '\\n', '_California a Free State._--With this increase in population there\\n', 'naturally resulted the usual demand for admission to the union.

Founded in 1830 under the leadership of\\n', 'Joseph Smith of New York, the sect had suffered from many cruel buffets\\n', 'of fortune. From Ohio they had migrated into Missouri where they were\\n', 'set upon and beaten. Some of them were murdered by indignant neighbors.\\n', 'Harried out of Missouri, they went into Illinois only to see their\\n', 'director and prophet, Smith, first imprisoned by the authorities and\\n', 'then shot by a mob. Having raised up a cloud of enemies on account of\\n', 'both their religious faith and their practice of allowing a man to have\\n', 'more than one wife, they fell in heartily with the suggestion of a new\\n', 'leader, Brigham Young, that they go into the Far West beyond the plains\\n', 'of Kansas--into the forlorn desert where the wicked would cease from\\n', 'troubling and the weary could be at rest, as they read in the Bible. In\\n', '1847, Young, with a company of picked men, searched far and wide until\\n', 'he found a suitable spot overlooking the Salt Lake Valley. Returning to\\n', 'Illinois, he gathered up his followers, now numbering several thousand,\\n', 'and in one mighty wagon caravan they all went to their distant haven.\\n', '\\n', '_Brigham Young and His Economic System._--In Brigham Young the Mormons\\n', 'had a leader of remarkable power who gave direction to the redemption of\\n', 'the arid soil, the management of property, and the upbuilding of\\n', 'industry. He promised them to make the desert blossom as the rose, and\\n', 'verily he did it. He firmly shaped the enterprise of the colony along\\n', 'co-operative lines, holding down the speculator and profiteer with one\\n', 'hand and giving encouragement to the industrious poor with the other.\\n', 'With the shrewdness befitting a good business man, he knew how to draw\\n', 'the line between public and private interest. Land was given outright to\\n', 'each family, but great care was exercised in the distribution so that\\n', 'none should have great advantage over another. The purchase of supplies\\n', 'and the sale of produce were carried on through a cooperative store, the\\n', 'profits of which went to the common good. Encountering for the first\\n', 'time in the history of the Anglo-Saxon race the problem of aridity, the\\n', 'Mormons surmounted the most perplexing obstacles with astounding skill.\\n', 'They built irrigation works by cooperative labor and granted water\\n', 'rights to all families on equitable terms.\\n', '\\n', '_The Growth of Industries._--Though farming long remained the major\\n', 'interest of the colony, the Mormons, eager to be self-supporting in\\n', 'every possible way, bent their efforts also to manufacturing and later\\n', 'to mining. Their missionaries, who hunted in the highways and byways of\\n', 'Europe for converts, never failed to stress the economic advantages of\\n', 'the sect. \"We want,\" proclaimed President Young to all the earth, \"a\\n', 'company of woolen manufacturers to come with machinery and take the wool\\n', 'from the sheep and convert it into the best clothes. We want a company\\n', 'of potters; we need them; the clay is ready and the dishes wanted.... We\\n', 'want some men to start a furnace forthwith; the iron, coal, and molders\\n', 'are waiting.... We have a printing press and any one who can take good\\n', 'printing and writing paper to the Valley will be a blessing to\\n', 'themselves and the church.\" Roads and bridges were built; millions were\\n', 'spent in experiments in agriculture and manufacturing; missionaries at a\\n', 'huge cost were maintained in the East and in Europe; an army was kept\\n', 'for defense against the Indians; and colonies were planted in the\\n', 'outlying regions. A historian of Deseret, as the colony was called by\\n', 'the Mormons, estimated in 1895 that by the labor of their hands the\\n', 'people had produced nearly half a billion dollars in wealth since the\\n', 'coming of the vanguard.\\n', '\\n', '_Polygamy Forbidden._--The hope of the Mormons that they might forever\\n', 'remain undisturbed by outsiders was soon dashed to earth, for hundreds\\n', 'of farmers and artisans belonging to other religious sects came to\\n', 'settle among them. In 1850 the colony was so populous and prosperous\\n', 'that it was organized into a territory of the United States and brought\\n', 'under the supervision of the federal government. Protests against\\n', 'polygamy were raised in the colony and at the seat of authority three\\n', 'thousand miles away at Washington. The new Republican party in 1856\\n', 'proclaimed it \"the right and duty of Congress to prohibit in the\\n', 'Territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery.\" In\\n', 'due time the Mormons had to give up their marriage practices which were\\n', 'condemned by the common opinion of all western civilization; but they\\n', 'kept their religious faith.

Some were immediate and obvious.\\n', 'Others require a fullness of time not yet reached to reveal their\\n', 'complete significance. Outstanding among them was the growth of an\\n', 'industrial population, detached from the land, concentrated in cities,\\n', 'and, to use Jefferson\\'s phrase, dependent upon \"the caprices and\\n', 'casualties of trade\" for a livelihood.

It is safe to assume, then, that\\n', 'one-third of the whole population is supported, directly, or indirectly,\\n', 'by manufacturing industry.\" Taking, however, the number of persons\\n', 'directly supported by manufactures, namely about six millions, reveals\\n', 'the astounding fact that the white laboring population, divorced from\\n', 'the soil, already exceeded the number of slaves on Southern farms and\\n', 'plantations.\\n', '\\n', '_Immigration._--The more carefully the rapid growth of the industrial\\n', 'population is examined, the more surprising is the fact that such an\\n', 'immense body of free laborers could be found, particularly when it is\\n', 'recalled to what desperate straits the colonial leaders were put in\\n', 'securing immigrants,--slavery, indentured servitude, and kidnapping\\n', 'being the fruits of their necessities. The answer to the enigma is to be\\n', 'found partly in European conditions and partly in the cheapness of\\n', 'transportation after the opening of the era of steam navigation. Shrewd\\n', 'observers of the course of events had long foreseen that a flood of\\n', 'cheap labor was bound to come when the way was made easy. Some, among\\n', 'them Chief Justice Ellsworth, went so far as to prophesy that white\\n', 'labor would in time be so abundant that slavery would disappear as the\\n', 'more costly of the two labor systems. The processes of nature were aided\\n', 'by the policies of government in England and Germany.\\n', '\\n', '_The Coming of the Irish._--The opposition of the Irish people to the\\n', 'English government, ever furious and irrepressible, was increased in the\\n', 'mid forties by an almost total failure of the potato crop, the main\\n', 'support of the peasants. Catholic in religion, they had been compelled\\n', 'to support a Protestant church. Tillers of the soil by necessity, they\\n', 'were forced to pay enormous tributes to absentee landlords in England\\n', 'whose claim to their estates rested upon the title of conquest and\\n', 'confiscation. Intensely loyal to their race, the Irish were subjected in\\n', 'all things to the Parliament at London, in which their small minority of\\n', 'representatives had little influence save in holding a balance of power\\n', 'between the two contending English parties. To the constant political\\n', 'irritation, the potato famine added physical distress beyond\\n', 'description. In cottages and fields and along the highways the victims\\n', 'of starvation lay dead by the hundreds, the relief which charity\\n', 'afforded only bringing misery more sharply to the foreground. Those who\\n', 'were fortunate enough to secure passage money sought escape to America.\\n', 'In 1844 the total immigration into the United States was less than\\n', 'eighty thousand; in 1850 it had risen by leaps and bounds to more than\\n', 'three hundred thousand. Between 1820 and 1860 the immigrants from the\\n', 'United Kingdom numbered 2,750,000, of whom more than one-half were\\n', 'Irish. It has been said with a touch of exaggeration that the American\\n', 'canals and railways of those days were built by the labor of Irishmen.\\n', '\\n', '_The German Migration._--To political discontent and economic distress,\\n', 'such as was responsible for the coming of the Irish, may likewise be\\n', 'traced the source of the Germanic migration. The potato blight that fell\\n', 'upon Ireland visited the Rhine Valley and Southern Germany at the same\\n', 'time with results as pitiful, if less extensive. The calamity inflicted\\n', 'by nature was followed shortly by another inflicted by the despotic\\n', 'conduct of German kings and princes. In 1848 there had occurred\\n', 'throughout Europe a popular uprising in behalf of republics and\\n', 'democratic government. For a time it rode on a full tide of success.\\n', 'Kings were overthrown, or compelled to promise constitutional\\n', 'government, and tyrannical ministers fled from their palaces. Then came\\n', 'reaction. Those who had championed the popular cause were imprisoned,\\n', 'shot, or driven out of the land. Men of attainments and distinction,\\n', 'whose sole offense was opposition to the government of kings and\\n', 'princes, sought an asylum in America, carrying with them to the land of\\n', 'their adoption the spirit of liberty and democracy. In 1847 over fifty\\n', 'thousand Germans came to America, the forerunners of a migration that\\n', 'increased, almost steadily, for many years. The record of 1860 showed\\n', 'that in the previous twenty years nearly a million and a half had found\\n', 'homes in the United States. Far and wide they scattered, from the mills\\n', 'and shops of the seacoast towns to the uttermost frontiers of Wisconsin\\n', 'and Minnesota.\\n', '\\n', '_The Labor of Women and Children._--If the industries, canals, and\\n', 'railways of the country were largely manned by foreign labor, still\\n', 'important native sources must not be overlooked; above all, the women\\n', 'and children of the New England textile districts. Spinning and weaving,\\n', 'by a tradition that runs far beyond the written records of mankind,\\n', 'belonged to women. Indeed it was the dexterous housewives, spinsters,\\n', 'and boys and girls that laid the foundations of the textile industry in\\n', 'America, foundations upon which the mechanical revolution was built. As\\n', 'the wheel and loom were taken out of the homes to the factories operated\\n', \"by water power or the steam engine, the women and, to use Hamilton's\\n\", 'phrase, \"the children of tender years,\" followed as a matter of course.\\n', '\"The cotton manufacture alone employs six thousand persons in Lowell,\"\\n', 'wrote a French observer in 1836; \"of this number nearly five thousand\\n', 'are young women from seventeen to twenty-four years of age, the\\n', 'daughters of farmers from the different New England states.\" It was not\\n', 'until after the middle of the century that foreign lands proved to be\\n', 'the chief source from which workers were recruited for the factories of\\n', 'New England. It was then that the daughters of the Puritans, outdone by\\n', 'the competition of foreign labor, both of men and women, left the\\n', 'spinning jenny and the loom to other hands.\\n', '\\n', '=The Rise of Organized Labor.=--The changing conditions of American\\n', 'life, marked by the spreading mill towns of New England, New York, and\\n', 'Pennsylvania and the growth of cities like Buffalo, Cincinnati,\\n', 'Louisville, St. Louis, Detroit, and Chicago in the West, naturally\\n', 'brought changes, as Jefferson had prophesied, in \"manners and morals.\" A\\n', 'few mechanics, smiths, carpenters, and masons, widely scattered through\\n', 'farming regions and rural villages, raise no such problems as tens of\\n', 'thousands of workers collected in one center in daily intercourse,\\n', 'learning the power of cooperation and union.\\n', '\\n', 'Even before the coming of steam and machinery, in the \"good old days\" of\\n', 'handicrafts, laborers in many trades--printers, shoemakers, carpenters,\\n', 'for example--had begun to draw together in the towns for the advancement\\n', 'of their interests in the form of higher wages, shorter days, and\\n', 'milder laws. The shoemakers of Philadelphia, organized in 1794,\\n', 'conducted a strike in 1799 and held together until indicted seven years\\n', 'later for conspiracy. During the twenties and thirties, local labor\\n', 'unions sprang up in all industrial centers and they led almost\\n', 'immediately to city federations of the several crafts.\\n', '\\n', 'As the thousands who were dependent upon their daily labor for their\\n', 'livelihood mounted into the millions and industries spread across the\\n', 'continent, the local unions of craftsmen grew into national craft\\n', 'organizations bound together by the newspapers, the telegraph, and the\\n', 'railways. Before 1860 there were several such national trade unions,\\n', 'including the plumbers, printers, mule spinners, iron molders, and stone\\n', 'cutters. All over the North labor leaders arose--men unknown to general\\n', 'history but forceful and resourceful characters who forged links binding\\n', 'scattered and individual workers into a common brotherhood. An attempt\\n', 'was even made in 1834 to federate all the crafts into a permanent\\n', 'national organization; but it perished within three years through lack\\n', 'of support. Half a century had to elapse before the American Federation\\n', 'of Labor was to accomplish this task.\\n', '\\n', 'All the manifestations of the modern labor movement had appeared, in\\n', 'germ at least, by the time the mid-century was reached: unions, labor\\n', 'leaders, strikes, a labor press, a labor political program, and a labor\\n', 'political party. In every great city industrial disputes were a common\\n', 'occurrence. The papers recorded about four hundred in two years,\\n', '1853-54, local affairs but forecasting economic struggles in a larger\\n', 'field. The labor press seems to have begun with the founding of the\\n', \"_Mechanics' Free Press_ in Philadelphia in 1828 and the establishment of\\n\", \"the New York _Workingman's Advocate_ shortly afterward. These\\n\", 'semi-political papers were in later years followed by regular trade\\n', 'papers designed to weld together and advance the interests of particular\\n', 'crafts. Edited by able leaders, these little sheets with limited\\n', 'circulation wielded an enormous influence in the ranks of the workers.\\n', '\\n', '=Labor and Politics.=--As for the political program of labor, the main\\n', 'planks were clear and specific: the abolition of imprisonment for debt,\\n', 'manhood suffrage in states where property qualifications still\\n', 'prevailed, free and universal education, laws protecting the safety and\\n', 'health of workers in mills and factories, abolition of lotteries, repeal\\n', 'of laws requiring militia service, and free land in the West.\\n', '\\n', 'Into the labor papers and platforms there sometimes crept a note of\\n', 'hostility to the masters of industry, a sign of bitterness that excited\\n', 'little alarm while cheap land in the West was open to the discontented.\\n', 'The Philadelphia workmen, in issuing a call for a local convention,\\n', 'invited \"all those of our fellow citizens who live by their own labor\\n', 'and none other.\" In Newcastle county, Delaware, the association of\\n', 'working people complained in 1830: \"The poor have no laws; the laws are\\n', 'made by the rich and of course for the rich.\" Here and there an\\n', 'extremist went to the length of advocating an equal division of wealth\\n', 'among all the people--the crudest kind of communism.\\n', '\\n', 'Agitation of this character produced in labor circles profound distrust\\n', 'of both Whigs and Democrats who talked principally about tariffs and\\n', 'banks; it resulted in attempts to found independent labor parties. In\\n', 'Philadelphia, Albany, New York City, and New England, labor candidates\\n', 'were put up for elections in the early thirties and in a few cases were\\n', 'victorious at the polls. \"The balance of power has at length got into\\n', 'the hands of the working people, where it properly belongs,\"\\n', \"triumphantly exclaimed the _Mechanics' Free Press_ of Philadelphia in\\n\", '1829. But the triumph was illusory. Dissensions appeared in the labor\\n', 'ranks. The old party leaders, particularly of Tammany Hall, the\\n', 'Democratic party organization in New York City, offered concessions to\\n', 'labor in return for votes. Newspapers unsparingly denounced \"trade union\\n', 'politicians\" as \"demagogues,\" \"levellers,\" and \"rag, tag, and bobtail\";\\n', 'and some of them, deeming labor unrest the sour fruit of manhood\\n', 'suffrage, suggested disfranchisement as a remedy. Under the influence\\n', 'of concessions and attacks the political fever quickly died away, and\\n', 'the end of the decade left no remnant of the labor political parties.\\n', 'Labor leaders turned to a task which seemed more substantial and\\n', 'practical, that of organizing workingmen into craft unions for the\\n', 'definite purpose of raising wages and reducing hours.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND NATIONAL POLITICS\\n', '\\n', '=Southern Plans for Union with the West.=--It was long the design of\\n', 'Southern statesmen like Calhoun to hold the West and the South together\\n', 'in one political party. The theory on which they based their hope was\\n', 'simple. Both sections were agricultural--the producers of raw materials\\n', 'and the buyers of manufactured goods. The planters were heavy purchasers\\n', 'of Western bacon, pork, mules, and grain. The Mississippi River and its\\n', 'tributaries formed the natural channel for the transportation of heavy\\n', 'produce southward to the plantations and outward to Europe. Therefore,\\n', 'ran their political reasoning, the interests of the two sections were\\n', 'one. By standing together in favor of low tariffs, they could buy their\\n', 'manufactures cheaply in Europe and pay for them in cotton, tobacco, and\\n', \"grain. The union of the two sections under Jackson's management seemed\\n\", 'perfect.\\n', '\\n', '=The East Forms Ties with the West.=--Eastern leaders were not blind to\\n', 'the ambitions of Southern statesmen. On the contrary, they also\\n', 'recognized the importance of forming strong ties with the agrarian West\\n', 'and drawing the produce of the Ohio Valley to Philadelphia and New York.\\n', 'The canals and railways were the physical signs of this economic union,\\n', 'and the results, commercial and political, were soon evident. By the\\n', 'middle of the century, Southern economists noted the change, one of\\n', 'them, De Bow, lamenting that \"the great cities of the North have\\n', 'severally penetrated the interior with artificial lines until they have\\n', 'taken from the open and untaxed current of the Mississippi the commerce\\n', 'produced on its borders.\" To this writer it was an astounding thing to\\n', 'behold \"the number of steamers that now descend the upper Mississippi\\n', 'River, loaded to the guards with produce, as far as the mouth of the\\n', 'Illinois River and then turn up that stream with their cargoes to be\\n', 'shipped to New York _via_ Chicago. The Illinois canal has not only swept\\n', 'the whole produce along the line of the Illinois River to the East, but\\n', 'it is drawing the products of the upper Mississippi through the same\\n', 'channel; thus depriving New Orleans and St. Louis of a rich portion of\\n', 'their former trade.\"\\n', '\\n', 'If to any shippers the broad current of the great river sweeping down to\\n', 'New Orleans offered easier means of physical communication to the sea\\n', 'than the canals and railways, the difference could be overcome by the\\n', 'credit which Eastern bankers were able to extend to the grain and\\n', 'produce buyers, in the first instance, and through them to the farmers\\n', 'on the soil. The acute Southern observer just quoted, De Bow, admitted\\n', 'with evident regret, in 1852, that \"last autumn, the rich regions of\\n', 'Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were flooded with the local bank notes of\\n', 'the Eastern States, advanced by the New York houses on produce to be\\n', 'shipped by way of the canals in the spring.... These moneyed facilities\\n', 'enable the packer, miller, and speculator to hold on to their produce\\n', 'until the opening of navigation in the spring and they are no longer\\n', 'obliged, as formerly, to hurry off their shipments during the winter by\\n', 'the way of New Orleans in order to realize funds by drafts on their\\n', 'shipments. The banking facilities at the East are doing as much to draw\\n', 'trade from us as the canals and railways which Eastern capital is\\n', 'constructing.\" Thus canals, railways, and financial credit were swiftly\\n', 'forging bonds of union between the old home of Jacksonian Democracy in\\n', 'the West and the older home of Federalism in the East. The nationalism\\n', 'to which Webster paid eloquent tribute became more and more real with\\n', 'the passing of time. The self-sufficiency of the pioneer was broken down\\n', 'as he began to watch the produce markets of New York and Philadelphia\\n', 'where the prices of corn and hogs fixed his earnings for the year.\\n', '\\n', '=The West and Manufactures.=--In addition to the commercial bonds\\n', 'between the East and the West there was growing up a common interest in\\n', 'manufactures. As skilled white labor increased in the Ohio Valley, the\\n', 'industries springing up in the new cities made Western life more like\\n', 'that of the industrial East than like that of the planting South.\\n', 'Moreover, the Western states produced some important raw materials for\\n', 'American factories, which called for protection against foreign\\n', 'competition, notably, wool, hemp, and flax. As the South had little or\\n', 'no foreign competition in cotton and tobacco, the East could not offer\\n', 'protection for her raw materials in exchange for protection for\\n', 'industries. With the West, however, it became possible to establish\\n', 'reciprocity in tariffs; that is, for example, to trade a high rate on\\n', 'wool for a high rate on textiles or iron.\\n', '\\n', '=The South Dependent on the North.=--While East and West were drawing\\n', 'together, the distinctions between North and South were becoming more\\n', 'marked; the latter, having few industries and producing little save raw\\n', 'materials, was being forced into the position of a dependent section. As\\n', 'a result of the protective tariff, Southern planters were compelled to\\n', 'turn more and more to Northern mills for their cloth, shoes, hats, hoes,\\n', 'plows, and machinery. Nearly all the goods which they bought in Europe\\n', 'in exchange for their produce came overseas to Northern ports, whence\\n', 'transshipments were made by rail and water to Southern points of\\n', 'distribution. Their rice, cotton, and tobacco, in as far as they were\\n', 'not carried to Europe in British bottoms, were transported by Northern\\n', 'masters. In these ways, a large part of the financial operations\\n', 'connected with the sale of Southern produce and the purchase of goods in\\n', 'exchange passed into the hands of Northern merchants and bankers who,\\n', 'naturally, made profits from their transactions. Finally, Southern\\n', 'planters who wanted to buy more land and more slaves on credit borrowed\\n', 'heavily in the North where huge accumulations made the rates of interest\\n', 'lower than the smaller banks of the South could afford.\\n', '\\n', '=The South Reckons the Cost of Economic Dependence.=--As Southern\\n', 'dependence upon Northern capital became more and more marked, Southern\\n', 'leaders began to chafe at what they regarded as restraints laid upon\\n', 'their enterprise. In a word, they came to look upon the planter as a\\n', 'tribute-bearer to the manufacturer and financier. \"The South,\"\\n', 'expostulated De Bow, \"stands in the attitude of feeding ... a vast\\n', 'population of [Northern] merchants, shipowners, capitalists, and others\\n', 'who, without claims on her progeny, drink up the life blood of her\\n', 'trade.... Where goes the value of our labor but to those who, taking\\n', 'advantage of our folly, ship for us, buy for us, sell to us, and, after\\n', 'turning our own capital to their profitable account, return laden with\\n', 'our money to enjoy their easily earned opulence at home.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Southern statisticians, not satisfied with generalities, attempted to\\n', 'figure out how great was this tribute in dollars and cents. They\\n', 'estimated that the planters annually lent to Northern merchants the full\\n', 'value of their exports, a hundred millions or more, \"to be used in the\\n', 'manipulation of foreign imports.\" They calculated that no less than\\n', 'forty millions all told had been paid to shipowners in profits. They\\n', 'reckoned that, if the South were to work up her own cotton, she would\\n', 'realize from seventy to one hundred millions a year that otherwise went\\n', 'North. Finally, to cap the climax, they regretted that planters spent\\n', 'some fifteen millions a year pleasure-seeking in the alluring cities and\\n', 'summer resorts of the North.\\n', '\\n', '=Southern Opposition to Northern Policies.=--Proceeding from these\\n', 'premises, Southern leaders drew the logical conclusion that the entire\\n', 'program of economic measures demanded in the North was without exception\\n', 'adverse to Southern interests and, by a similar chain of reasoning,\\n', 'injurious to the corn and wheat producers of the West. Cheap labor\\n', 'afforded by free immigration, a protective tariff raising prices of\\n', 'manufactures for the tiller of the soil, ship subsidies increasing the\\n', 'tonnage of carrying trade in Northern hands, internal improvements\\n', 'forging new economic bonds between the East and the West, a national\\n', 'banking system giving strict national control over the currency as a\\n', 'safeguard against paper inflation--all these devices were regarded in\\n', 'the South as contrary to the planting interest. They were constantly\\n', 'compared with the restrictive measures by which Great Britain more than\\n', 'half a century before had sought to bind American interests.\\n', '\\n', 'As oppression justified a war for independence once, statesmen argued,\\n', 'so it can justify it again. \"It is curious as it is melancholy and\\n', 'distressing,\" came a broad hint from South Carolina, \"to see how\\n', 'striking is the analogy between the colonial vassalage to which the\\n', 'manufacturing states have reduced the planting states and that which\\n', 'formerly bound the Anglo-American colonies to the British empire....\\n', \"England said to her American colonies: 'You shall not trade with the\\n\", 'rest of the world for such manufactures as are produced in the mother\\n', \"country.' The manufacturing states say to their Southern colonies: 'You\\n\", 'shall not trade with the rest of the world for such manufactures as we\\n', 'produce.\\'\" The conclusion was inexorable: either the South must control\\n', 'the national government and its economic measures, or it must declare,\\n', 'as America had done four score years before, its political and economic\\n', 'independence. As Northern mills multiplied, as railways spun their\\n', 'mighty web over the face of the North, and as accumulated capital rose\\n', 'into the hundreds of millions, the conviction of the planters and their\\n', 'statesmen deepened into desperation.\\n', '\\n', '=Efforts to Start Southern Industries Fail.=--A few of them, seeing the\\n', 'predominance of the North, made determined efforts to introduce\\n', 'manufactures into the South. To the leaders who were averse to secession\\n', 'and nullification this seemed the only remedy for the growing disparity\\n', 'in the power of the two sections. Societies for the encouragement of\\n', 'mechanical industries were formed, the investment of capital was sought,\\n', 'and indeed a few mills were built on Southern soil. The results were\\n', 'meager. The natural resources, coal and water power, were abundant; but\\n', 'the enterprise for direction and the skilled labor were wanting. The\\n', 'stream of European immigration flowed North and West, not South. The\\n', 'Irish or German laborer, even if he finally made his home in a city, had\\n', 'before him, while in the North, the alternative of a homestead on\\n', 'Western land. To him slavery was a strange, if not a repelling,\\n', 'institution. He did not take to it kindly nor care to fix his home where\\n', 'it flourished. While slavery lasted, the economy of the South was\\n', 'inevitably agricultural. While agriculture predominated, leadership with\\n', 'equal necessity fell to the planting interest. While the planting\\n', 'interest ruled, political opposition to Northern economy was destined to\\n', 'grow in strength.\\n', '\\n', '=The Southern Theory of Sectionalism.=--In the opinion of the statesmen\\n', 'who frankly represented the planting interest, the industrial system was\\n', 'its deadly enemy. Their entire philosophy of American politics was\\n', 'summed up in a single paragraph by McDuffie, a spokesman for South\\n', 'Carolina: \"Owing to the federative character of our government, the\\n', 'great geographical extent of our territory, and the diversity of the\\n', 'pursuits of our citizens in different parts of the union, it has so\\n', 'happened that two great interests have sprung up, standing directly\\n', 'opposed to each other. One of these consists of those manufactures which\\n', 'the Northern and Middle states are capable of producing but which, owing\\n', 'to the high price of labor and the high profits of capital in those\\n', 'states, cannot hold competition with foreign manufactures without the\\n', 'aid of bounties, directly or indirectly given, either by the general\\n', 'government or by the state governments. The other of these interests\\n', 'consists of the great agricultural staples of the Southern states which\\n', 'can find a market only in foreign countries and which can be\\n', 'advantageously sold only in exchange for foreign manufactures which come\\n', 'in competition with those of the Northern and Middle states.... These\\n', 'interests then stand diametrically and irreconcilably opposed to each\\n', 'other. The interest, the pecuniary interest of the Northern\\n', 'manufacturer, is directly promoted by every increase of the taxes\\n', 'imposed upon Southern commerce; and it is unnecessary to add that the\\n', 'interest of the Southern planter is promoted by every diminution of\\n', 'taxes imposed upon the productions of their industry. If, under these\\n', 'circumstances, the manufacturers were clothed with the power of imposing\\n', 'taxes, at their pleasure, upon the foreign imports of the planter, no\\n', 'doubt would exist in the mind of any man that it would have all the\\n', 'characteristics of an absolute and unqualified despotism.\" The economic\\n', 'soundness of this reasoning, a subject of interesting speculation for\\n', 'the economist, is of little concern to the historian. The historical\\n', 'point is that this opinion was widely held in the South and with the\\n', 'progress of time became the prevailing doctrine of the planting\\n', 'statesmen.\\n', '\\n', 'Their antagonism was deepened because they also became convinced, on\\n', 'what grounds it is not necessary to inquire, that the leaders of the\\n', 'industrial interest thus opposed to planting formed a consolidated\\n', '\"aristocracy of wealth,\" bent upon the pursuit and attainment of\\n', 'political power at Washington. \"By the aid of various associated\\n', 'interests,\" continued McDuffie, \"the manufacturing capitalists have\\n', 'obtained a complete and permanent control over the legislation of\\n', 'Congress on this subject [the tariff].... Men confederated together upon\\n', 'selfish and interested principles, whether in pursuit of the offices or\\n', 'the bounties of the government, are ever more active and vigilant than\\n', 'the great majority who act from disinterested and patriotic impulses.\\n', 'Have we not witnessed it on this floor, sir? Who ever knew the tariff\\n', 'men to divide on any question affecting their confederated interests?...\\n', 'The watchword is, stick together, right or wrong upon every question\\n', 'affecting the common cause. Such, sir, is the concert and vigilance and\\n', 'such the combinations by which the manufacturing party, acting upon the\\n', 'interests of some and the prejudices of others, have obtained a decided\\n', 'and permanent control over public opinion in all the tariff states.\"\\n', 'Thus, as the Southern statesman would have it, the North, in matters\\n', 'affecting national policies, was ruled by a \"confederated interest\"\\n', 'which menaced the planting interest. As the former grew in magnitude and\\n', 'attached to itself the free farmers of the West through channels of\\n', 'trade and credit, it followed as night the day that in time the planters\\n', 'would be overshadowed and at length overborne in the struggle of giants.\\n', 'Whether the theory was sound or not, Southern statesmen believed it and\\n', 'acted upon it.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', 'M.

Finally it raged in the angry political quarrel which\\n', 'culminated in the Civil War.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SLAVERY--NORTH AND SOUTH\\n', '\\n', '=The Decline of Slavery in the North.=--At the time of the adoption of\\n', 'the Constitution, slavery was lawful in all the Northern states except\\n', 'Massachusetts. There were almost as many bondmen in New York as in\\n', 'Georgia. New Jersey had more than Delaware or Tennessee, indeed nearly\\n', 'as many as both combined. All told, however, there were only about forty\\n', 'thousand in the North as against nearly seven hundred thousand in the\\n', 'South. Moreover, most of the Northern slaves were domestic servants, not\\n', 'laborers necessary to keep mills going or fields under cultivation.\\n', '\\n', 'There was, in the North, a steadily growing moral sentiment against the\\n', 'system. Massachusetts abandoned it in 1780. In the same year,\\n', 'Pennsylvania provided for gradual emancipation. New Hampshire, where\\n', 'there had been only a handful, Connecticut with a few thousand\\n', 'domestics, and New Jersey early followed these examples. New York, in\\n', '1799, declared that all children born of slaves after July 4 of that\\n', 'year should be free, though held for a term as apprentices; and in 1827\\n', 'it swept away the last vestiges of slavery. So with the passing of the\\n', 'generation that had framed the Constitution, chattel servitude\\n', 'disappeared in the commercial states, leaving behind only such\\n', 'discriminations as disfranchisement or high property qualifications on\\n', 'colored voters.\\n', '\\n', '=The Growth of Northern Sentiment against Slavery.=--In both sections of\\n', 'the country there early existed, among those more or less\\n', 'philosophically inclined, a strong opposition to slavery on moral as\\n', 'well as economic grounds. In the constitutional convention of 1787,\\n', 'Gouverneur Morris had vigorously condemned it and proposed that the\\n', 'whole country should bear the cost of abolishing it. About the same time\\n', 'a society for promoting the abolition of slavery, under the presidency\\n', 'of Benjamin Franklin, laid before Congress a petition that serious\\n', 'attention be given to the emancipation of \"those unhappy men who alone\\n', 'in this land of freedom are degraded into perpetual bondage.\" When\\n', 'Congress, acting on the recommendations of President Jefferson, provided\\n', 'for the abolition of the foreign slave trade on January 1, 1808, several\\n', 'Northern members joined with Southern members in condemning the system\\n', 'as well as the trade. Later, colonization societies were formed to\\n', 'encourage the emancipation of slaves and their return to Africa. James\\n', 'Madison was president and Henry Clay vice president of such an\\n', 'organization.\\n', '\\n', 'The anti-slavery sentiment of which these were the signs was\\n', 'nevertheless confined to narrow circles and bore no trace of bitterness.\\n', '\\n', '\"We consider slavery your calamity, not your crime,\" wrote a\\n', 'distinguished Boston clergyman to his Southern brethren, \"and we will\\n', 'share with you the burden of putting an end to it. We will consent that\\n', 'the public lands shall be appropriated to this object.... I deprecate\\n', 'everything which sows discord and exasperating sectional animosities.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Uncompromising Abolition.=--In a little while the spirit of generosity\\n', 'was gone. Just as Jacksonian Democracy rose to power there appeared a\\n', 'new kind of anti-slavery doctrine--the dogmatism of the abolition\\n', 'agitator. For mild speculation on the evils of the system was\\n', 'substituted an imperious and belligerent demand for instant\\n', 'emancipation. If a date must be fixed for its appearance, the year 1831\\n', 'may be taken when William Lloyd Garrison founded in Boston his\\n', 'anti-slavery paper, _The Liberator_. With singleness of purpose and\\n', 'utter contempt for all opposing opinions and arguments, he pursued his\\n', 'course of passionate denunciation. He apologized for having ever\\n', '\"assented to the popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition.\"\\n', 'He chose for his motto: \"Immediate and unconditional emancipation!\" He\\n', 'promised his readers that he would be \"harsh as truth and uncompromising\\n', 'as justice\"; that he would not \"think or speak or write with\\n', 'moderation.\" Then he flung out his defiant call: \"I am in earnest--I\\n', 'will not equivocate--I will not excuse--I will not retreat a single\\n', 'inch--and I will be heard....\\n', '\\n', '     \\'Such is the vow I take, so help me God.\\'\"\\n', '\\n', 'Though Garrison complained that \"the apathy of the people is enough to\\n', 'make every statue leap from its pedestal,\" he soon learned how alive the\\n', 'masses were to the meaning of his propaganda. Abolition orators were\\n', 'stoned in the street and hissed from the platform. Their meeting places\\n', 'were often attacked and sometimes burned to the ground. Garrison himself\\n', 'was assaulted in the streets of Boston, finding refuge from the angry\\n', 'mob behind prison bars. Lovejoy, a publisher in Alton, Illinois, for his\\n', 'willingness to give abolition a fair hearing, was brutally murdered; his\\n', 'printing press was broken to pieces as a warning to all those who\\n', \"disturbed the nation's peace of mind. The South, doubly frightened by a\\n\", 'slave revolt in 1831 which ended in the murder of a number of men,\\n', 'women, and children, closed all discussion of slavery in that section.\\n', '\"Now,\" exclaimed Calhoun, \"it is a question which admits of neither\\n', 'concession nor compromise.\"\\n', '\\n', 'As the opposition hardened, the anti-slavery agitation gathered in force\\n', 'and intensity. Whittier blew his blast from the New England hills:\\n', '\\n', '    \"No slave-hunt in our borders--no pirate on our strand;\\n', '     No fetters in the Bay State--no slave upon our land.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Lowell, looking upon the espousal of a great cause as the noblest aim of\\n', 'his art, ridiculed and excoriated bondage in the South. Those\\n', 'abolitionists, not gifted as speakers or writers, signed petitions\\n', 'against slavery and poured them in upon Congress. The flood of them was\\n', 'so continuous that the House of Representatives, forgetting its\\n', 'traditions, adopted in 1836 a \"gag rule\" which prevented the reading of\\n', 'appeals and consigned them to the waste basket. Not until the Whigs were\\n', 'in power nearly ten years later was John Quincy Adams able, after a\\n', 'relentless campaign, to carry a motion rescinding the rule.\\n', '\\n', 'How deep was the impression made upon the country by this agitation for\\n', 'immediate and unconditional emancipation cannot be measured. If the\\n', 'popular vote for those candidates who opposed not slavery, but its\\n', 'extension to the territories, be taken as a standard, it was slight\\n', 'indeed. In 1844, the Free Soil candidate, Birney, polled 62,000 votes\\n', 'out of over a million and a half; the Free Soil vote of the next\\n', 'campaign went beyond a quarter of a million, but the increase was due to\\n', 'the strength of the leader, Martin Van Buren; four years afterward it\\n', 'receded to 156,000, affording all the outward signs for the belief that\\n', 'the pleas of the abolitionist found no widespread response among the\\n', 'people. Yet the agitation undoubtedly ran deeper than the ballot box.\\n', 'Young statesmen of the North, in whose hands the destiny of frightful\\n', 'years was to lie, found their indifference to slavery broken and their\\n', 'consciences stirred by the unending appeal and the tireless reiteration.\\n', 'Charles Sumner afterward boasted that he read the _Liberator_ two years\\n', 'before Wendell Phillips, the young Boston lawyer who cast aside his\\n', 'profession to take up the dangerous cause.\\n', '\\n', '=Early Southern Opposition to Slavery.=--In the South, the sentiment\\n', 'against slavery was strong; it led some to believe that it would also\\n', 'come to an end there in due time. Washington disliked it and directed in\\n', 'his will that his own slaves should be set free after the death of his\\n', 'wife. Jefferson, looking into the future, condemned the system by which\\n', 'he also lived, saying: \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure\\n', 'when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of\\n', 'the people that their liberties are the gift of God? Are they not to be\\n', 'violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I\\n', 'reflect that God is just; that His justice cannot sleep forever.\" Nor\\n', 'did Southern men confine their sentiments to expressions of academic\\n', 'opinion. They accepted in 1787 the Ordinance which excluded slavery from\\n', 'the Northwest territory forever and also the Missouri Compromise, which\\n', 'shut it out of a vast section of the Louisiana territory.\\n', '\\n', '=The Revolution in the Slave System.=--Among the representatives of\\n', 'South Carolina and Georgia, however, the anti-slavery views of\\n', 'Washington and Jefferson were by no means approved; and the drift of\\n', 'Southern economy was decidedly in favor of extending and perpetuating,\\n', 'rather than abolishing, the system of chattel servitude. The invention\\n', 'of the cotton gin and textile machinery created a market for cotton\\n', 'which the planters, with all their skill and energy, could hardly\\n', 'supply. Almost every available acre was brought under cotton culture as\\n', 'the small farmers were driven steadily from the seaboard into the\\n', 'uplands or to the Northwest.\\n', '\\n', 'The demand for slaves to till the swiftly expanding fields was enormous.\\n', \"The number of bondmen rose from 700,000 in Washington's day to more than\\n\", 'three millions in 1850. At the same time slavery itself was transformed.\\n', 'Instead of the homestead where the same family of masters kept the same\\n', 'families of slaves from generation to generation, came the plantation\\n', 'system of the Far South and Southwest where masters were ever moving and\\n', 'ever extending their holdings of lands and slaves. This in turn reacted\\n', 'on the older South where the raising of slaves for the market became a\\n', 'regular and highly profitable business.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', 'JOHN C. CALHOUN]\\n', '\\n', '=Slavery Defended as a Positive Good.=--As the abolition agitation\\n', 'increased and the planting system expanded, apologies for slavery became\\n', 'fainter and fainter in the South. Then apologies were superseded by\\n', 'claims that slavery was a beneficial scheme of labor control. Calhoun,\\n', 'in a famous speech in the Senate in 1837, sounded the new note by\\n', 'declaring slavery \"instead of an evil, a good--a positive good.\" His\\n', 'reasoning was as follows: in every civilized society one portion of the\\n', 'community must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the\\n', 'arts are built upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his\\n', 'master and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than\\n', 'the free laborers of Europe; and under the slave system conflicts\\n', 'between capital and labor are avoided. The advantages of slavery in this\\n', 'respect, he concluded, \"will become more and more manifest, if left\\n', 'undisturbed by interference from without, as the country advances in\\n', 'wealth and numbers.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Slave Owners Dominate Politics.=--The new doctrine of Calhoun was\\n', 'eagerly seized by the planters as they came more and more to overshadow\\n', 'the small farmers of the South and as they beheld the menace of\\n', 'abolition growing upon the horizon. It formed, as they viewed matters, a\\n', 'moral defense for their labor system--sound, logical, invincible. It\\n', 'warranted them in drawing together for the protection of an institution\\n', 'so necessary, so inevitable, so beneficent.\\n', '\\n', 'Though in 1850 the slave owners were only about three hundred and fifty\\n', 'thousand in a national population of nearly twenty million whites, they\\n', 'had an influence all out of proportion to their numbers. They were knit\\n', 'together by the bonds of a common interest. They had leisure and wealth.\\n', 'They could travel and attend conferences and conventions. Throughout the\\n', 'South and largely in the North, they had the press, the schools, and the\\n', 'pulpits on their side. They formed, as it were, a mighty union for the\\n', 'protection and advancement of their common cause. Aided by those\\n', 'mechanics and farmers of the North who stuck by Jacksonian Democracy\\n', 'through thick and thin, the planters became a power in the federal\\n', 'government. \"We nominate Presidents,\" exultantly boasted a Richmond\\n', 'newspaper; \"the North elects them.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This jubilant Southern claim was conceded by William H. Seward, a\\n', 'Republican Senator from New York, in a speech describing the power of\\n', 'slavery in the national government. \"A party,\" he said, \"is in one sense\\n', 'a joint stock association, in which those who contribute most direct the\\n', 'action and management of the concern.... The slaveholders, contributing\\n', 'in an overwhelming proportion to the strength of the Democratic party,\\n', 'necessarily dictate and prescribe its policy.\" He went on: \"The\\n', 'slaveholding class has become the governing power in each of the\\n', 'slaveholding states and it practically chooses thirty of the sixty-two\\n', 'members of the Senate, ninety of the two hundred and thirty-three\\n', 'members of the House of Representatives, and one hundred and five of the\\n', 'two hundred and ninety-five electors of President and Vice-President of\\n', 'the United States.\" Then he considered the slave power in the Supreme\\n', 'Court. \"That tribunal,\" he exclaimed, \"consists of a chief justice and\\n', 'eight associate justices. Of these, five were called from slave states\\n', 'and four from free states. The opinions and bias of each of them were\\n', 'carefully considered by the President and Senate when he was appointed.\\n', 'Not one of them was found wanting in soundness of politics, according to\\n', 'the slaveholder\\'s exposition of the Constitution.\" Such was the Northern\\n', 'view of the planting interest that, from the arena of national politics,\\n', 'challenged the whole country in 1860.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF SLAVES IN THE SOUTHERN STATES]\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SLAVERY IN NATIONAL POLITICS\\n', '\\n', '=National Aspects of Slavery.=--It may be asked why it was that slavery,\\n', 'founded originally on state law and subject to state government, was\\n', 'drawn into the current of national affairs. The answer is simple. There\\n', 'were, in the first place, constitutional reasons. The Congress of the\\n', 'United States had to make all needful rules for the government of the\\n', 'territories, the District of Columbia, the forts and other property\\n', 'under national authority; so it was compelled to determine whether\\n', 'slavery should exist in the places subject to its jurisdiction. Upon\\n', 'Congress was also conferred the power of admitting new states; whenever\\n', 'a territory asked for admission, the issue could be raised as to whether\\n', 'slavery should be sanctioned or excluded. Under the Constitution,\\n', 'provision was made for the return of runaway slaves; Congress had the\\n', 'power to enforce this clause by appropriate legislation. Since the\\n', 'control of the post office was vested in the federal government, it had\\n', 'to face the problem raised by the transmission of abolition literature\\n', 'through the mails. Finally citizens had the right of petition; it\\n', 'inheres in all free government and it is expressly guaranteed by the\\n', 'first amendment to the Constitution. It was therefore legal for\\n', 'abolitionists to present to Congress their petitions, even if they asked\\n', 'for something which it had no right to grant. It was thus impossible,\\n', 'constitutionally, to draw a cordon around the slavery issue and confine\\n', 'the discussion of it to state politics.\\n', '\\n', 'There were, in the second place, economic reasons why slavery was\\n', 'inevitably drawn into the national sphere. It was the basis of the\\n', 'planting system which had direct commercial relations with the North and\\n', 'European countries; it was affected by federal laws respecting tariffs,\\n', 'bounties, ship subsidies, banking, and kindred matters. The planters of\\n', 'the South, almost without exception, looked upon the protective tariff\\n', 'as a tribute laid upon them for the benefit of Northern industries. As\\n', 'heavy borrowers of money in the North, they were generally in favor of\\n', '\"easy money,\" if not paper currency, as an aid in the repayment of their\\n', 'debts. This threw most of them into opposition to the Whig program for a\\n', 'United States Bank. All financial aids to American shipping they stoutly\\n', 'resisted, preferring to rely upon the cheaper service rendered by\\n', 'English shippers. Internal improvements, those substantial ties that\\n', 'were binding the West to the East and turning the traffic from New\\n', 'Orleans to Philadelphia and New York, they viewed with alarm. Free\\n', 'homesteads from the public lands, which tended to overbalance the South\\n', 'by building free states, became to them a measure dangerous to their\\n', 'interests. Thus national economic policies, which could not by any twist\\n', 'or turn be confined to state control, drew the slave system and its\\n', 'defenders into the political conflict that centered at Washington.\\n', '\\n', '=Slavery and the Territories--the Missouri Compromise (1820).=--Though\\n', 'men continually talked about \"taking slavery out of politics,\" it could\\n', 'not be done. By 1818 slavery had become so entrenched and the\\n', \"anti-slavery sentiment so strong, that Missouri's quest for admission\\n\", 'brought both houses of Congress into a deadlock that was broken only by\\n', 'compromise. The South, having half the Senators, could prevent the\\n', 'admission of Missouri stripped of slavery; and the North, powerful in\\n', 'the House of Representatives, could keep Missouri with slavery out of\\n', 'the union indefinitely. An adjustment of pretensions was the last\\n', 'resort. Maine, separated from the parent state of Massachusetts, was\\n', 'brought into the union with freedom and Missouri with bondage. At the\\n', 'same time it was agreed that the remainder of the vast Louisiana\\n', \"territory north of the parallel of 36 o 30' should be, like the old\\n\", 'Northwest, forever free; while the southern portion was left to slavery.\\n', 'In reality this was an immense gain for liberty. The area dedicated to\\n', 'free farmers was many times greater than that left to the planters. The\\n', 'principle was once more asserted that Congress had full power to prevent\\n', 'slavery in the territories.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE]\\n', '\\n', '=The Territorial Question Reopened by the Wilmot Proviso.=--To the\\n', 'Southern leaders, the annexation of Texas and the conquest of Mexico\\n', 'meant renewed security to the planting interest against the increasing\\n', 'wealth and population of the North. Texas, it was said, could be divided\\n', 'into four slave states. The new territories secured by the treaty of\\n', 'peace with Mexico contained the promise of at least three more. Thus, as\\n', 'each new free soil state knocked for admission into the union, the\\n', 'South could demand as the price of its consent a new slave state. No\\n', 'wonder Southern statesmen saw, in the annexation of Texas and the\\n', 'conquest of Mexico, slavery and King Cotton triumphant--secure for all\\n', 'time against adverse legislation. Northern leaders were equally\\n', 'convinced that the Southern prophecy was true. Abolitionists and\\n', 'moderate opponents of slavery alike were in despair. Texas, they\\n', 'lamented, would fasten slavery upon the country forevermore. \"No living\\n', 'man,\" cried one, \"will see the end of slavery in the United States!\"\\n', '\\n', 'It so happened, however, that the events which, it was thought, would\\n', 'secure slavery let loose a storm against it.

By these acts the boundaries of Texas were adjusted and the\\n', 'territory of New Mexico created, subject to the provision that all or\\n', 'any part of it might be admitted to the union \"with or without slavery\\n', 'as their constitution may provide at the time of their admission.\" The\\n', 'Territory of Utah was similarly organized with the same conditions as to\\n', 'slavery, thus repudiating the Wilmot Proviso without guaranteeing\\n', 'slavery to the planters. California was admitted as a free state under a\\n', 'constitution in which the people of the territory had themselves\\n', 'prohibited slavery.\\n', '\\n', 'The slave trade was abolished in the District of Columbia, but slavery\\n', 'itself existed as before at the capital of the nation.

Unwittingly the avalanche was started.\\n', '\\n', 'After a stormy debate, in which important amendments were forced on\\n', 'Douglas, the Kansas-Nebraska Bill became a law on May 30, 1854. The\\n', 'measure created two territories, Kansas and Nebraska, and provided that\\n', 'they, or territories organized out of them, could come into the union as\\n', 'states \"with or without slavery as their constitutions may prescribe at\\n', 'the time of their admission.\" Not content with this, the law went on to\\n', 'declare the Missouri Compromise null and void as being inconsistent with\\n', 'the principle of non-intervention by Congress with slavery in the states\\n', 'and territories. Thus by a single blow the very heart of the continent,\\n', 'dedicated to freedom by solemn agreement, was thrown open to slavery. A\\n', 'desperate struggle between slave owners and the advocates of freedom was\\n', 'the outcome in Kansas.\\n', '\\n', 'If Douglas fancied that the North would receive the overthrow of the\\n', \"Missouri Compromise in the same temper that it greeted Clay's\\n\", 'settlement, he was rapidly disillusioned. A blast of rage, terrific in\\n', 'its fury, swept from Maine to Iowa. Staid old Boston hanged him in\\n', 'effigy with an inscription--\"Stephen A. Douglas, author of the infamous\\n', 'Nebraska bill: the Benedict Arnold of 1854.\" City after city burned him\\n', 'in effigy until, as he himself said, he could travel from the Atlantic\\n', 'coast to Chicago in the light of the fires. Thousands of Whigs and\\n', 'Free-soil Democrats deserted their parties which had sanctioned or at\\n', 'least tolerated the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, declaring that the startling\\n', 'measure showed an evident resolve on the part of the planters to rule\\n', 'the whole country. A gage of defiance was thrown down to the\\n', 'abolitionists. An issue was set even for the moderate and timid who had\\n', 'been unmoved by the agitation over slavery in the Far South. That issue\\n', 'was whether slavery was to be confined within its existing boundaries or\\n', 'be allowed to spread without interference, thereby placing the free\\n', 'states in the minority and surrendering the federal government wholly to\\n', 'the slave power.\\n', '\\n', '=The Rise of the Republican Party.=--Events of terrible significance,\\n', 'swiftly following, drove the country like a ship before a gale straight\\n', 'into civil war. The Kansas-Nebraska Bill rent the old parties asunder\\n', 'and called into being the Republican party. While that bill was pending\\n', 'in Congress, many Northern Whigs and Democrats had come to the\\n', 'conclusion that a new party dedicated to freedom in the territories must\\n', 'follow the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Several places claim to be\\n', 'the original home of the Republican party; but historians generally\\n', 'yield it to Wisconsin. At Ripon in that state, a mass meeting of Whigs\\n', 'and Democrats assembled in February, 1854, and resolved to form a new\\n', 'party if the Kansas-Nebraska Bill should pass. At a second meeting a\\n', 'fusion committee representing Whigs, Free Soilers, and Democrats was\\n', \"formed and the name Republican--the name of Jefferson's old party--was\\n\", 'selected. All over the country similar meetings were held and political\\n', 'committees were organized.\\n', '\\n', 'When the presidential campaign of 1856 began the Republicans entered the\\n', 'contest. After a preliminary conference in Pittsburgh in February, they\\n', 'held a convention in Philadelphia at which was drawn up a platform\\n', 'opposing the extension of slavery to the territories. John C. Fremont,\\n', 'the distinguished explorer, was named for the presidency. The results\\n', 'of the election were astounding as compared with the Free-soil failure\\n', 'of the preceding election. Prominent men like Longfellow, Washington\\n', 'Irving, William Cullen Bryant, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and George William\\n', 'Curtis went over to the new party and 1,341,264 votes were rolled up for\\n', '\"free labor, free speech, free men, free Kansas, and Fremont.\"\\n', 'Nevertheless the victory of the Democrats was decisive. Their candidate,\\n', 'James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, was elected by a majority of 174 to 114\\n', 'electoral votes.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: SLAVE AND FREE SOIL ON EVE OF CIVIL WAR]\\n', '\\n', '=The Dred Scott Decision (1857).=--In his inaugural, Buchanan vaguely\\n', 'hinted that in a forthcoming decision the Supreme Court would settle one\\n', 'of the vital questions of the day. This was a reference to the Dred\\n', 'Scott case then pending. Scott was a slave who had been taken by his\\n', 'master into the upper Louisiana territory, where freedom had been\\n', 'established by the Missouri Compromise, and then carried back into his\\n', 'old state of Missouri. He brought suit for his liberty on the ground\\n', 'that his residence in the free territory made him free. This raised the\\n', 'question whether the law of Congress prohibiting slavery north of 36 o\\n', \"30' was authorized by the federal Constitution or not. The Court might\\n\", 'have avoided answering it by saying that even though Scott was free in\\n', 'the territory, he became a slave again in Missouri by virtue of the law\\n', 'of that state. The Court, however, faced the issue squarely. It held\\n', 'that Scott had not been free anywhere and that, besides, the Missouri\\n', 'Compromise violated the Constitution and was null and void.\\n', '\\n', 'The decision was a triumph for the South. It meant that Congress after\\n', 'all had no power to abolish slavery in the territories. Under the decree\\n', 'of the highest court in the land, that could be done only by an\\n', 'amendment to the Constitution which required a two-thirds vote in\\n', 'Congress and the approval of three-fourths of the states. Such an\\n', 'amendment was obviously impossible--the Southern states were too\\n', 'numerous; but the Republicans were not daunted. \"We know,\" said Lincoln,\\n', '\"the Court that made it has often overruled its own decisions and we\\n', 'shall do what we can to have it overrule this.\" Legislatures of Northern\\n', 'states passed resolutions condemning the decision and the Republican\\n', 'platform of 1860 characterized the dogma that the Constitution carried\\n', 'slavery into the territories as \"a dangerous political heresy at\\n', 'variance with the explicit provisions of that instrument itself ... with\\n', 'legislative and judicial precedent ... revolutionary in tendency and\\n', 'subversive of the peace and harmony of the country.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Panic of 1857.=--In the midst of the acrimonious dispute over the\\n', 'Dred Scott decision, came one of the worst business panics which ever\\n', 'afflicted the country. In the spring and summer of 1857, fourteen\\n', 'railroad corporations, including the Erie, Michigan Central, and the\\n', 'Illinois Central, failed to meet their obligations; banks and insurance\\n', 'companies, some of them the largest and strongest institutions in the\\n', 'North, closed their doors; stocks and bonds came down in a crash on the\\n', 'markets; manufacturing was paralyzed; tens of thousands of working\\n', 'people were thrown out of employment; \"hunger meetings\" of idle men were\\n', 'held in the cities and banners bearing the inscription, \"We want\\n', 'bread,\" were flung out. In New York, working men threatened to invade\\n', 'the Council Chamber to demand \"work or bread,\" and the frightened mayor\\n', 'called for the police and soldiers. For this distressing state of\\n', 'affairs many remedies were offered; none with more zeal and persistence\\n', 'than the proposal for a higher tariff to take the place of the law of\\n', 'March, 1857, a Democratic measure making drastic reductions in the rates\\n', 'of duty. In the manufacturing districts of the North, the panic was\\n', 'ascribed to the \"Democratic assault on business.\" So an old issue was\\n', 'again vigorously advanced, preparatory to the next presidential\\n', 'campaign.\\n', '\\n', '=The Lincoln-Douglas Debates.=--The following year the interest of the\\n', 'whole country was drawn to a series of debates held in Illinois by\\n', 'Lincoln and Douglas, both candidates for the United States Senate. In\\n', 'the course of his campaign Lincoln had uttered his trenchant saying that\\n', '\"a house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government\\n', 'cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.\" At the same time he\\n', 'had accused Douglas, Buchanan, and the Supreme Court of acting in\\n', 'concert to make slavery national. This daring statement arrested the\\n', 'attention of Douglas, who was making his campaign on the doctrine of\\n', '\"squatter sovereignty;\" that is, the right of the people of each\\n', 'territory \"to vote slavery up or down.\" After a few long-distance shots\\n', 'at each other, the candidates agreed to meet face to face and discuss\\n', 'the issues of the day. Never had such crowds been seen at political\\n', 'meetings in Illinois. Farmers deserted their plows, smiths their forges,\\n', 'and housewives their baking to hear \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Little Giant.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The results of the series of debates were momentous. Lincoln clearly\\n', 'defined his position. The South, he admitted, was entitled under the\\n', 'Constitution to a fair, fugitive slave law. He hoped that there might be\\n', 'no new slave states; but he did not see how Congress could exclude the\\n', 'people of a territory from admission as a state if they saw fit to adopt\\n', 'a constitution legalizing the ownership of slaves. He favored the\\n', 'gradual abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia and the total\\n', 'exclusion of it from the territories of the United States by act of\\n', 'Congress.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, he drove Douglas into a hole by asking how he squared\\n', '\"squatter sovereignty\" with the Dred Scott decision; how, in other\\n', 'words, the people of a territory could abolish slavery when the Court\\n', 'had declared that Congress, the superior power, could not do it under\\n', 'the Constitution? To this baffling question Douglas lamely replied that\\n', 'the inhabitants of a territory, by \"unfriendly legislation,\" might make\\n', 'property in slaves insecure and thus destroy the institution. This\\n', \"answer to Lincoln's query alienated many Southern Democrats who believed\\n\", 'that the Dred Scott decision settled the question of slavery in the\\n', 'territories for all time. Douglas won the election to the Senate; but\\n', 'Lincoln, lifted into national fame by the debates, beat him in the\\n', 'campaign for President two years later.\\n', '\\n', \"=John Brown's Raid.=--To the abolitionists the line of argument pursued\\n\", 'by Lincoln, including his proposal to leave slavery untouched in the\\n', 'states where it existed, was wholly unsatisfactory. One of them, a grim\\n', 'and resolute man, inflamed by a hatred for slavery in itself, turned\\n', 'from agitation to violence. \"These men are all talk; what is needed is\\n', 'action--action!\" So spoke John Brown of New York. During the sanguinary\\n', 'struggle in Kansas he hurried to the frontier, gun and dagger in hand,\\n', 'to help drive slave owners from the free soil of the West. There he\\n', 'committed deeds of such daring and cruelty that he was outlawed and a\\n', 'price put upon his head. Still he kept on the path of \"action.\" Aided by\\n', 'funds from Northern friends, he gathered a small band of his followers\\n', 'around him, saying to them: \"If God be for us, who can be against us?\"\\n', 'He went into Virginia in the autumn of 1859, hoping, as he explained,\\n', '\"to effect a mighty conquest even though it be like the last victory of\\n', 'Samson.\" He seized the government armory at Harper\\'s Ferry, declared\\n', 'free the slaves whom he found, and called upon them to take up arms in\\n', 'defense of their liberty. His was a hope as forlorn as it was desperate.\\n', 'Armed forces came down upon him and, after a hard battle, captured him.\\n', 'Tried for treason, Brown was condemned to death. The governor of\\n', 'Virginia turned a deaf ear to pleas for clemency based on the ground\\n', 'that the prisoner was simply a lunatic. \"This is a beautiful country,\"\\n', 'said the stern old Brown glancing upward to the eternal hills on his way\\n', 'to the gallows, as calmly as if he were returning home from a long\\n', 'journey. \"So perish all such enemies of Virginia. All such enemies of\\n', 'the Union. All such foes of the human race,\" solemnly announced the\\n', 'executioner as he fulfilled the judgment of the law.\\n', '\\n', 'The raid and its grim ending deeply moved the country. Abolitionists\\n', 'looked upon Brown as a martyr and tolled funeral bells on the day of his\\n', 'execution. Longfellow wrote in his diary: \"This will be a great day in\\n', 'our history; the date of a new revolution as much needed as the old\\n', 'one.\" Jefferson Davis saw in the affair \"the invasion of a state by a\\n', 'murderous gang of abolitionists bent on inciting slaves to murder\\n', 'helpless women and children\"--a crime for which the leader had met a\\n', \"felon's death. Lincoln spoke of the raid as absurd, the deed of an\\n\", 'enthusiast who had brooded over the oppression of a people until he\\n', 'fancied himself commissioned by heaven to liberate them--an attempt\\n', 'which ended in \"little else than his own execution.\" To Republican\\n', 'leaders as a whole, the event was very embarrassing. They were taunted\\n', 'by the Democrats with responsibility for the deed. Douglas declared his\\n', '\"firm and deliberate conviction that the Harper\\'s Ferry crime was the\\n', 'natural, logical, inevitable result of the doctrines and teachings of\\n', 'the Republican party.\" So persistent were such attacks that the\\n', 'Republicans felt called upon in 1860 to denounce Brown\\'s raid \"as among\\n', 'the gravest of crimes.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Democrats Divided.=--When the Democratic convention met at\\n', \"Charleston in the spring of 1860, a few months after Brown's execution,\\n\", 'it soon became clear that there was danger ahead. Between the extreme\\n', 'slavery advocates of the Far South and the so-called pro-slavery\\n', 'Democrats of the Douglas type, there was a chasm which no appeals to\\n', 'party loyalty could bridge. As the spokesman of the West, Douglas knew\\n', 'that, while the North was not abolitionist, it was passionately set\\n', 'against an extension of slavery into the territories by act of Congress;\\n', 'that squatter sovereignty was the mildest kind of compromise acceptable\\n', 'to the farmers whose votes would determine the fate of the election.\\n', 'Southern leaders would not accept his opinion. Yancey, speaking for\\n', 'Alabama, refused to palter with any plan not built on the proposition\\n', 'that slavery was in itself right. He taunted the Northern Democrats with\\n', 'taking the view that slavery was wrong, but that they could not do\\n', 'anything about it. That, he said, was the fatal error--the cause of all\\n', 'discord, the source of \"Black Republicanism,\" as well as squatter\\n', 'sovereignty. The gauntlet was thus thrown down at the feet of the\\n', 'Northern delegates: \"You must not apologize for slavery; you must\\n', 'declare it right; you must advocate its extension.\" The challenge, so\\n', 'bluntly put, was as bluntly answered. \"Gentlemen of the South,\"\\n', 'responded a delegate from Ohio, \"you mistake us. You mistake us. We will\\n', 'not do it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'For ten days the Charleston convention wrangled over the platform and\\n', 'balloted for the nomination of a candidate. Douglas, though in the lead,\\n', 'could not get the two-thirds vote required for victory. For more than\\n', 'fifty times the roll of the convention was called without a decision.\\n', 'Then in sheer desperation the convention adjourned to meet later at\\n', 'Baltimore. When the delegates again assembled, their passions ran as\\n', 'high as ever. The division into two irreconcilable factions was\\n', 'unchanged. Uncompromising delegates from the South withdrew to Richmond,\\n', 'nominated John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky for President, and put forth\\n', 'a platform asserting the rights of slave owners in the territories and\\n', 'the duty of the federal government to protect them. The delegates who\\n', 'remained at Baltimore nominated Douglas and endorsed his doctrine of\\n', 'squatter sovereignty.\\n', '\\n', '=The Constitutional Union Party.=--While the Democratic party was being\\n', 'disrupted, a fragment of the former Whig party, known as the\\n', 'Constitutional Unionists, held a convention at Baltimore and selected\\n', 'national candidates: John Bell from Tennessee and Edward Everett from\\n', 'Massachusetts. A melancholy interest attached to this assembly. It was\\n', 'mainly composed of old men whose political views were those of Clay and\\n', 'Webster, cherished leaders now dead and gone. In their platform they\\n', 'sought to exorcise the evil spirit of partisanship by inviting their\\n', 'fellow citizens to \"support the Constitution of the country, the union\\n', 'of the states, and the enforcement of the laws.\" The party that\\n', 'campaigned on this grand sentiment only drew laughter from the Democrats\\n', 'and derision from the Republicans and polled less than one-fourth the\\n', 'votes.\\n', '\\n', '=The Republican Convention.=--With the Whigs definitely forced into a\\n', 'separate group, the Republican convention at Chicago was fated to be\\n', 'sectional in character, although five slave states did send delegates.\\n', 'As the Democrats were split, the party that had led a forlorn hope four\\n', 'years before was on the high road to success at last. New and powerful\\n', 'recruits were found. The advocates of a high protective tariff and the\\n', 'friends of free homesteads for farmers and workingmen mingled with\\n', 'enthusiastic foes of slavery. While still firm in their opposition to\\n', 'slavery in the territories, the Republicans went on record in favor of a\\n', 'homestead law granting free lands to settlers and approved customs\\n', 'duties designed \"to encourage the development of the industrial\\n', 'interests of the whole country.\" The platform was greeted with cheers\\n', 'which, according to the stenographic report of the convention, became\\n', 'loud and prolonged as the protective tariff and homestead planks were\\n', 'read.\\n', '\\n', 'Having skillfully drawn a platform to unite the North in opposition to\\n', 'slavery and the planting system, the Republicans were also adroit in\\n', 'their selection of a candidate. The tariff plank might carry\\n', 'Pennsylvania, a Democratic state; but Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were\\n', 'equally essential to success at the polls. The southern counties of\\n', 'these states were filled with settlers from Virginia, North Carolina,\\n', 'and Kentucky who, even if they had no love for slavery, were no friends\\n', 'of abolition. Moreover, remembering the old fight on the United States\\n', \"Bank in Andrew Jackson's day, they were suspicious of men from the East.\\n\", 'Accordingly, they did not favor the candidacy of Seward, the leading\\n', 'Republican statesman and \"favorite son\" of New York.\\n', '\\n', 'After much trading and discussing, the convention came to the conclusion\\n', 'that Abraham Lincoln of Illinois was the most \"available\" candidate. He\\n', 'was of Southern origin, born in Kentucky in 1809, a fact that told\\n', 'heavily in the campaign in the Ohio Valley. He was a man of the soil,\\n', 'the son of poor frontier parents, a pioneer who in his youth had labored\\n', 'in the fields and forests, celebrated far and wide as \"honest Abe, the\\n', 'rail-splitter.\" It was well-known that he disliked slavery, but was no\\n', \"abolitionist. He had come dangerously near to Seward's radicalism in his\\n\", '\"house-divided-against-itself\" speech but he had never committed himself\\n', 'to the reckless doctrine that there was a \"higher law\" than the\\n', 'Constitution. Slavery in the South he tolerated as a bitter fact;\\n', 'slavery in the territories he opposed with all his strength. Of his\\n', 'sincerity there could be no doubt. He was a speaker and writer of\\n', 'singular power, commanding, by the use of simple and homely language,\\n', 'the hearts and minds of those who heard him speak or read his printed\\n', 'words. He had gone far enough in his opposition to slavery; but not too\\n', 'far. He was the man of the hour! Amid lusty cheers from ten thousand\\n', 'throats, Lincoln was nominated for the presidency by the Republicans. In\\n', 'the ensuing election, he carried all the free states except New Jersey.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', 'P.E.

That theory, as every one knows, was\\n', 'carefully formulated by Webster and elaborated by Lincoln. According to\\n', 'it, the union was older than the states; it was created before the\\n', 'Declaration of Independence for the purpose of common defense. The\\n', 'Articles of Confederation did but strengthen this national bond and the\\n', 'Constitution sealed it forever. The federal government was not a\\n', 'creature of state governments. It was erected by the people and derived\\n', 'its powers directly from them. \"It is,\" said Webster, \"the people\\'s\\n', \"Constitution, the people's government; made for the people; made by the\\n\", 'people; and answerable to the people. The people of the United States\\n', 'have declared that this Constitution shall be the supreme law.\" When a\\n', 'state questions the lawfulness of any act of the federal government, it\\n', 'cannot nullify that act or withdraw from the union; it must abide by the\\n', 'decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. The union of these\\n', \"states is perpetual, ran Lincoln's simple argument in the first\\n\", 'inaugural; the federal Constitution has no provision for its own\\n', 'termination; it can be destroyed only by some action not provided for in\\n', 'the instrument itself; even if it is a compact among all the states the\\n', 'consent of all must be necessary to its dissolution; therefore no state\\n', 'can lawfully get out of the union and acts of violence against the\\n', 'United States are insurrectionary or revolutionary. This was the system\\n', 'which he believed himself bound to defend by his oath of office\\n', '\"registered in heaven.\"\\n', '\\n', 'All this reasoning Southern statesmen utterly rejected. In their opinion\\n', 'the thirteen original states won their independence as separate and\\n', 'sovereign powers. The treaty of peace with Great Britain named them all\\n', 'and acknowledged them \"to be free, sovereign, and independent states.\"\\n', 'The Articles of Confederation very explicitly declared that \"each state\\n', 'retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence.\" The Constitution\\n', 'was a \"league of nations\" formed by an alliance of thirteen separate\\n', 'powers, each one of which ratified the instrument before it was put into\\n', 'effect. They voluntarily entered the union under the Constitution and\\n', 'voluntarily they could leave it. Such was the constitutional doctrine of\\n', 'Hayne, Calhoun, and Jefferson Davis. In seceding, the Southern states\\n', 'had only to follow legal methods, and the transaction would be correct\\n', 'in every particular. So conventions were summoned, elections were held,\\n', 'and \"sovereign assemblies of the people\" set aside the Constitution in\\n', 'the same manner as it had been ratified nearly four score years before.\\n', 'Thus, said the Southern people, the moral judgment was fulfilled and the\\n', 'letter of the law carried into effect.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: JEFFERSON DAVIS]\\n', '\\n', '=The Formation of the Confederacy.=--Acting on the call of Mississippi,\\n', 'a congress of delegates from the seceded states met at Montgomery,\\n', 'Alabama, and on February 8, 1861, adopted a temporary plan of union.

The North had a scheme of taxation\\n', 'that produced large revenues from numerous sources; the South had to\\n', 'formulate and carry out a financial plan. Like the North, the\\n', 'Confederacy expected to secure a large revenue from customs duties,\\n', 'easily collected and little felt among the masses. To this expectation\\n', 'the blockade of Southern ports inaugurated by Lincoln in April, 1861,\\n', 'soon put an end. Following the precedent set by Congress under the\\n', 'Articles of Confederation, the Southern Congress resorted to a direct\\n', 'property tax apportioned among the states, only to meet the failure that\\n', 'might have been foretold.\\n', '\\n', 'The Confederacy also sold bonds, the first issue bringing into the\\n', 'treasury nearly all the specie available in the Southern banks. This\\n', 'specie by unhappy management was early sent abroad to pay for supplies,\\n', 'sapping the foundations of a sound currency system. Large amounts of\\n', 'bonds were sold overseas, commanding at first better terms than those\\n', 'of the North in the markets of London, Paris, and Amsterdam, many an\\n', 'English lord and statesman buying with enthusiasm and confidence to\\n', 'lament within a few years the proofs of his folly. The difficulties of\\n', 'bringing through the blockade any supplies purchased by foreign bond\\n', 'issues, however, nullified the effect of foreign credit and forced the\\n', 'Confederacy back upon the device of paper money. In all approximately\\n', 'one billion dollars streamed from the printing presses, to fall in value\\n', 'at an alarming rate, reaching in January, 1863, the astounding figure of\\n', 'fifty dollars in paper money for one in gold. Every known device was\\n', 'used to prevent its depreciation, without result. To the issues of the\\n', 'Confederate Congress were added untold millions poured out by the states\\n', 'and by private banks.\\n', '\\n', '=Human and Material Resources.=--When we measure strength for strength\\n', 'in those signs of power--men, money, and supplies--it is difficult to\\n', 'see how the South was able to embark on secession and war with such\\n', 'confidence in the outcome. In the Confederacy at the final reckoning\\n', 'there were eleven states in all, to be pitted against twenty-two; a\\n', 'population of nine millions, nearly one-half servile, to be pitted\\n', 'against twenty-two millions; a land without great industries to produce\\n', 'war supplies and without vast capital to furnish war finances, joined in\\n', 'battle with a nation already industrial and fortified by property worth\\n', 'eleven billion dollars. Even after the Confederate Congress authorized\\n', 'conscription in 1862, Southern man power, measured in numbers, was\\n', 'wholly inadequate to uphold the independence which had been declared.\\n', 'How, therefore, could the Confederacy hope to sustain itself against\\n', '\\n', 'such a combination of men, money, and materials as the North could\\n', 'marshal?\\n', '\\n', '=Southern Expectations.=--The answer to this question is to be found in\\n', 'the ideas that prevailed among Southern leaders. First of all, they\\n', 'hoped, in vain, to carry the Confederacy up to the Ohio River; and, with\\n', 'the aid of Missouri, to gain possession of the Mississippi Valley, the\\n', 'granary of the nation. In the second place, they reckoned upon a large\\n', 'and continuous trade with Great Britain--the exchange of cotton for war\\n', 'materials. They likewise expected to receive recognition and open aid\\n', 'from European powers that looked with satisfaction upon the breakup of\\n', 'the great American republic. In the third place, they believed that\\n', 'their control over several staples so essential to Northern industry\\n', 'would enable them to bring on an industrial crisis in the manufacturing\\n', 'states. \"I firmly believe,\" wrote Senator Hammond, of South Carolina, in\\n', '1860, \"that the slave-holding South is now the controlling power of the\\n', 'world; that no other power would face us in hostility. Cotton, rice,\\n', 'tobacco, and naval stores command the world; and we have the sense to\\n', 'know it and are sufficiently Teutonic to carry it out successfully. The\\n', 'North without us would be a motherless calf, bleating about, and die of\\n', 'mange and starvation.\"\\n', '\\n', 'There were other grounds for confidence. Having seized all of the\\n', 'federal military and naval supplies in the South, and having left the\\n', 'national government weak in armed power during their possession of the\\n', 'presidency, Southern leaders looked to a swift war, if it came at all,\\n', 'to put the finishing stroke to independence. \"The greasy mechanics of\\n', 'the North,\" it was repeatedly said, \"will not fight.\" As to disparity in\\n', 'numbers they drew historic parallels. \"Our fathers, a mere handful,\\n', 'overcame the enormous power of Great Britain,\" a saying of ex-President\\n', 'Tyler, ran current to reassure the doubtful. Finally, and this point\\n', 'cannot be too strongly emphasized, the South expected to see a weakened\\n', 'and divided North. It knew that the abolitionists and the Southern\\n', 'sympathizers were ready to let the Confederate states go in peace; that\\n', 'Lincoln represented only a little more than one-third the voters of the\\n', 'country; and that the vote for Douglas, Bell, and Breckinridge meant a\\n', 'decided opposition to the Republicans and their policies.\\n', '\\n', '=Efforts at Compromise.=--Republican leaders, on reviewing the same\\n', 'facts, were themselves uncertain as to the outcome of a civil war and\\n', 'made many efforts to avoid a crisis. Thurlow Weed, an Albany journalist\\n', 'and politician who had done much to carry New York for Lincoln, proposed\\n', 'a plan for extending the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific.\\n', 'Jefferson Davis, warning his followers that a war if it came would be\\n', 'terrible, was prepared to accept the offer; but Lincoln, remembering his\\n', 'campaign pledges, stood firm as a rock against it. His followers in\\n', 'Congress took the same position with regard to a similar settlement\\n', 'suggested by Senator Crittenden of Kentucky.\\n', '\\n', 'Though unwilling to surrender his solemn promises respecting slavery in\\n', 'the territories, Lincoln was prepared to give to Southern leaders a\\n', 'strong guarantee that his administration would not interfere directly or\\n', 'indirectly with slavery in the states. Anxious to reassure the South on\\n', 'this point, the Republicans in Congress proposed to write into the\\n', 'Constitution a declaration that no amendment should ever be made\\n', 'authorizing the abolition of or interference with slavery in any state.\\n', 'The resolution, duly passed, was sent forth on March 4, 1861, with the\\n', 'approval of Lincoln; it was actually ratified by three states before the\\n', 'storm of war destroyed it. By the irony of fate the thirteenth amendment\\n', 'was to abolish, not guarantee, slavery.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE WAR MEASURES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\\n', '\\n', '=Raising the Armies.=--The crisis at Fort Sumter, on April 12-14, 1861,\\n', 'forced the President and Congress to turn from negotiations to problems\\n', 'of warfare. Little did they realize the magnitude of the task before\\n', \"them. Lincoln's first call for volunteers, issued on April 15, 1861,\\n\", 'limited the number to 75,000, put their term of service at three months,\\n', 'and prescribed their duty as the enforcement of the law against\\n', 'combinations too powerful to be overcome by ordinary judicial process.\\n', 'Disillusionment swiftly followed. The terrible defeat of the Federals at\\n', 'Bull Run on July 21 revealed the serious character of the task before\\n', 'them; and by a series of measures Congress put the entire man power of\\n', \"the country at the President's command. Under these acts, he issued new\\n\", 'calls for volunteers. Early in August, 1862, he ordered a draft of\\n', \"militiamen numbering 300,000 for nine months' service. The results were\\n\", 'disappointing--ominous--for only about 87,000 soldiers were added to the\\n', 'army. Something more drastic was clearly necessary.\\n', '\\n', 'In March, 1863, Lincoln signed the inevitable draft law; it enrolled in\\n', 'the national forces liable to military duty all able-bodied male\\n', 'citizens and persons of foreign birth who had declared their intention\\n', 'to become citizens, between the ages of twenty and forty-five\\n', 'years--with exemptions on grounds of physical weakness and dependency.\\n', 'From the men enrolled were drawn by lot those destined to active\\n', 'service. Unhappily the measure struck a mortal blow at the principle of\\n', 'universal liability by excusing any person who found a substitute for\\n', 'himself or paid into the war office a sum, not exceeding three hundred\\n', 'dollars, to be fixed by general order. This provision, so crass and so\\n', 'obviously favoring the well-to-do, sowed seeds of bitterness which\\n', 'sprang up a hundredfold in the North.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: THE DRAFT RIOTS IN NEW YORK CITY]\\n', '\\n', 'The beginning of the drawings under the draft act in New York City, on\\n', 'Monday, July 13, 1863, was the signal for four days of rioting. In the\\n', 'course of this uprising, draft headquarters were destroyed; the office\\n', 'of the _Tribune_ was gutted; negroes were seized, hanged, and shot; the\\n', 'homes of obnoxious Unionists were burned down; the residence of the\\n', 'mayor of the city was attacked; and regular battles were fought in the\\n', 'streets between the rioters and the police. Business stopped and a large\\n', 'part of the city passed absolutely into the control of the mob. Not\\n', 'until late the following Wednesday did enough troops arrive to restore\\n', 'order and enable the residents of the city to resume their daily\\n', 'activities. At least a thousand people had been killed or wounded and\\n', \"more than a million dollars' worth of damage done to property. The draft\\n\", 'temporarily interrupted by this outbreak was then resumed and carried\\n', 'out without further trouble.\\n', '\\n', 'The results of the draft were in the end distinctly disappointing to the\\n', 'government. The exemptions were numerous and the number who preferred\\n', 'and were able to pay $300 rather than serve exceeded all expectations.\\n', 'Volunteering, it is true, was stimulated, but even that resource could\\n', 'hardly keep the thinning ranks of the army filled. With reluctance\\n', 'Congress struck out the $300 exemption clause, but still favored the\\n', 'well-to-do by allowing them to hire substitutes if they could find them.\\n', 'With all this power in its hands the administration was able by January,\\n', '1865, to construct a union army that outnumbered the Confederates two to\\n', 'one.\\n', '\\n', '=War Finance.=--In the financial sphere the North faced immense\\n', 'difficulties. The surplus in the treasury had been dissipated by 1861\\n', 'and the tariff of 1857 had failed to produce an income sufficient to\\n', 'meet the ordinary expenses of the government. Confronted by military and\\n', 'naval expenditures of appalling magnitude, rising from $35,000,000 in\\n', 'the first year of the war to $1,153,000,000 in the last year, the\\n', 'administration had to tap every available source of income. The duties\\n', 'on imports were increased, not once but many times, producing huge\\n', 'revenues and also meeting the most extravagant demands of the\\n', 'manufacturers for protection. Direct taxes were imposed on the states\\n', 'according to their respective populations, but the returns were\\n', 'meager--all out of proportion to the irritation involved. Stamp taxes\\n', 'and taxes on luxuries, occupations, and the earnings of corporations\\n', 'were laid with a weight that, in ordinary times, would have drawn forth\\n', 'opposition of ominous strength. The whole gamut of taxation was run.\\n', 'Even a tax on incomes and gains by the year, the first in the history of\\n', 'the federal government, was included in the long list.\\n', '\\n', 'Revenues were supplemented by bond issues, mounting in size and interest\\n', 'rate, until in October, at the end of the war, the debt stood at\\n', '$2,208,000,000. The total cost of the war was many times the money value\\n', 'of all the slaves in the Southern states. To the debt must be added\\n', 'nearly half a billion dollars in \"greenbacks\"--paper money issued by\\n', 'Congress in desperation as bond sales and revenues from taxes failed to\\n', 'meet the rising expenditures. This currency issued at par on\\n', 'questionable warrant from the Constitution, like all such paper, quickly\\n', 'began to decline until in the worst fortunes of 1864 one dollar in gold\\n', 'was worth nearly three in greenbacks.\\n', '\\n', '=The Blockade of Southern Ports.=--Four days after his call for\\n', 'volunteers, April 19, 1861, President Lincoln issued a proclamation\\n', 'blockading the ports of the Southern Confederacy. Later the blockade was\\n', 'extended to Virginia and North Carolina, as they withdrew from the\\n', 'union. Vessels attempting to enter or leave these ports, if they\\n', 'disregarded the warnings of a blockading ship, were to be captured and\\n', 'brought as prizes to the nearest convenient port. To make the order\\n', 'effective, immediate steps were taken to increase the naval forces,\\n', 'depleted by neglect, until the entire coast line was patrolled with such\\n', 'a number of ships that it was a rare captain who ventured to run the\\n', 'gantlet. The collision between the _Merrimac_ and the _Monitor_ in\\n', 'March, 1862, sealed the fate of the Confederacy. The exploits of the\\n', 'union navy are recorded in the falling export of cotton: $202,000,000 in\\n', '1860; $42,000,000 in 1861; and $4,000,000 in 1862.\\n', '\\n', 'The deadly effect of this paralysis of trade upon Southern war power may\\n', 'be readily imagined. Foreign loans, payable in cotton, could be\\n', 'negotiated but not paid off. Supplies could be purchased on credit but\\n', 'not brought through the drag net. With extreme difficulty could the\\n', 'Confederate government secure even paper for the issue of money and\\n', 'bonds. Publishers, in despair at the loss of supplies, were finally\\n', 'driven to the use of brown wrapping paper and wall paper. As the\\n', 'railways and rolling stock wore out, it became impossible to renew them\\n', 'from England or France. Unable to export their cotton, planters on the\\n', 'seaboard burned it in what were called \"fires of patriotism.\" In their\\n', 'lurid light the fatal weakness of Southern economy stood revealed.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: A BLOCKADE RUNNER]\\n', '\\n', '=Diplomacy.=--The war had not advanced far before the federal government\\n', 'became involved in many perplexing problems of diplomacy in Europe. The\\n', 'Confederacy early turned to England and France for financial aid and for\\n', 'recognition as an independent power. Davis believed that the industrial\\n', 'crisis created by the cotton blockade would in time literally compel\\n', 'Europe to intervene in order to get this essential staple. The crisis\\n', 'came as he expected but not the result. Thousands of English textile\\n', 'workers were thrown out of employment; and yet, while on the point of\\n', 'starvation, they adopted resolutions favoring the North instead of\\n', 'petitioning their government to aid the South by breaking the blockade.\\n', '\\n', 'With the ruling classes it was far otherwise. Napoleon III, the Emperor\\n', 'of the French, was eager to help in disrupting the American republic; if\\n', \"he could have won England's support, he would have carried out his\\n\", 'designs. As it turned out he found plenty of sympathy across the Channel\\n', 'but not open and official cooperation. According to the eminent\\n', 'historian, Rhodes, \"four-fifths of the British House of Lords and most\\n', 'members of the House of Commons were favorable to the Confederacy and\\n', 'anxious for its triumph.\" Late in 1862 the British ministers, thus\\n', 'sustained, were on the point of recognizing the independence of the\\n', 'Confederacy. Had it not been for their extreme caution, for the constant\\n', 'and harassing criticism by English friends of the United States--like\\n', 'John Bright--and for the victories of Vicksburg and Gettysburg, both\\n', '\\n', 'England and France would have doubtless declared the Confederacy to be\\n', 'one of the independent powers of the earth.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: JOHN BRIGHT]\\n', '\\n', 'While stopping short of recognizing its independence, England and France\\n', 'took several steps that were in favor of the South. In proclaiming\\n', 'neutrality, they early accepted the Confederates as \"belligerents\" and\\n', 'accorded them the rights of people at war--a measure which aroused anger\\n', 'in the North at first but was later admitted to be sound. Otherwise\\n', 'Confederates taken in battle would have been regarded as \"rebels\" or\\n', '\"traitors\" to be hanged or shot. Napoleon III proposed to Russia in 1861\\n', 'a coalition of powers against the North, only to meet a firm refusal.\\n', 'The next year he suggested intervention to Great Britain, encountering\\n', 'this time a conditional rejection of his plans. In 1863, not daunted by\\n', 'rebuffs, he offered his services to Lincoln as a mediator, receiving in\\n', 'reply a polite letter declining his proposal and a sharp resolution from\\n', 'Congress suggesting that he attend to his own affairs.\\n', '\\n', 'In both England and France the governments pursued a policy of\\n', 'friendliness to the Confederate agents. The British ministry, with\\n', 'indifference if not connivance, permitted rams and ships to be built in\\n', 'British docks and allowed them to escape to play havoc under the\\n', 'Confederate flag with American commerce. One of them, the _Alabama_,\\n', 'built in Liverpool by a British firm and paid for by bonds sold in\\n', 'England, ran an extraordinary career and threatened to break the\\n', 'blockade. The course followed by the British government, against the\\n', 'protests of the American minister in London, was later regretted. By an\\n', 'award of a tribunal of arbitration at Geneva in 1872, Great Britain was\\n', 'required to pay the huge sum of $15,500,000 to cover the damages wrought\\n', 'by Confederate cruisers fitted out in England.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: WILLIAM H. SEWARD]\\n', '\\n', 'In all fairness it should be said that the conduct of the North\\n', 'contributed to the irritation between the two countries. Seward, the\\n', 'Secretary of State, was vindictive in dealing with Great Britain; had it\\n', 'not been for the moderation of Lincoln, he would have pursued a course\\n', 'verging in the direction of open war. The New York and Boston papers\\n', 'were severe in their attacks on England. Words were, on one occasion at\\n', 'least, accompanied by an act savoring of open hostility. In November,\\n', '1861, Captain Wilkes, commanding a union vessel, overhauled the British\\n', 'steamer _Trent_, and carried off by force two Confederate agents, Mason\\n', 'and Slidell, sent by President Davis to represent the Confederacy at\\n', 'London and Paris respectively. This was a clear violation of the right\\n', 'of merchant vessels to be immune from search and impressment; and, in\\n', 'answer to the demand of Great Britain for the release of the two men,\\n', 'the United States conceded that it was in the wrong. It surrendered the\\n', 'two Confederate agents to a British vessel for safe conduct abroad, and\\n', 'made appropriate apologies.\\n', '\\n', '=Emancipation.=--Among the extreme war measures adopted by the Northern\\n', 'government must be counted the emancipation of the slaves in the states\\n', 'in arms against the union. This step was early and repeatedly suggested\\n', 'to Lincoln by the abolitionists; but was steadily put aside. He knew\\n', 'that the abolitionists were a mere handful, that emancipation might\\n', 'drive the border states into secession, and that the Northern soldiers\\n', 'had enlisted to save the union. Moreover, he had before him a solemn\\n', 'resolution passed by Congress on July 22, 1861, declaring the sole\\n', 'purpose of the war to be the salvation of the union and disavowing any\\n', 'intention of interfering with slavery.\\n', '\\n', 'The federal government, though pledged to the preservation of slavery,\\n', 'soon found itself beaten back upon its course and out upon a new tack.\\n', 'Before a year had elapsed, namely on April 10, 1862, Congress resolved\\n', 'that financial aid should be given to any state that might adopt gradual\\n', 'emancipation. Six days later it abolished slavery in the District of\\n', 'Columbia. Two short months elapsed. On June 19, 1862, it swept slavery\\n', 'forever from the territories of the United States. Chief Justice Taney\\n', 'still lived, the Dred Scott decision stood as written in the book, but\\n', 'the Constitution had been re-read in the light of the Civil War. The\\n', 'drift of public sentiment in the North was being revealed.\\n', '\\n', 'While these measures were pending in Congress, Lincoln was slowly making\\n', 'up his mind. By July of that year he had come to his great decision.\\n', 'Near the end of that month he read to his cabinet the draft of a\\n', 'proclamation of emancipation; but he laid it aside until a military\\n', 'achievement would make it something more than an idle gesture. In\\n', 'September, the severe check administered to Lee at Antietam seemed to\\n', 'offer the golden opportunity. On the 22d, the immortal document was\\n', 'given to the world announcing that, unless the states in arms returned\\n', 'to the union by January 1, 1863, the fatal blow at their \"peculiar\\n', 'institution\" would be delivered. Southern leaders treated it with slight\\n', 'regard, and so on the date set the promise was fulfilled. The\\n', 'proclamation was issued as a war measure, adopted by the President as\\n', 'commander-in-chief of the armed forces, on grounds of military\\n', 'necessity. It did not abolish slavery. It simply emancipated slaves in\\n', 'places then in arms against federal authority. Everywhere else slavery,\\n', 'as far as the Proclamation was concerned, remained lawful.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: ABRAHAM LINCOLN]\\n', '\\n', 'To seal forever the proclamation of emancipation, and to extend freedom\\n', 'to the whole country, Congress, in January, 1865, on the urgent\\n', 'recommendation of Lincoln, transmitted to the states the thirteenth\\n', 'amendment, abolishing slavery throughout the United States. By the end\\n', 'of 1865 the amendment was ratified. The house was not divided against\\n', 'itself; it did not fall; it was all free.\\n', '\\n', '=The Restraint of Civil Liberty.=--As in all great wars, particularly\\n', 'those in the nature of a civil strife, it was found necessary to use\\n', \"strong measures to sustain opinion favorable to the administration's\\n\", 'military policies and to frustrate the designs of those who sought to\\n', 'hamper its action. Within two weeks of his first call for volunteers,\\n', 'Lincoln empowered General Scott to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_\\n', 'along the line of march between Philadelphia and Washington and thus to\\n', 'arrest and hold without interference from civil courts any one whom he\\n', 'deemed a menace to the union. At a later date the area thus ruled by\\n', 'military officers was extended by executive proclamation. By an act of\\n', 'March 3, 1863, Congress, desiring to lay all doubts about the\\n', \"President's power, authorized him to suspend the writ throughout the\\n\", 'United States or in any part thereof. It also freed military officers\\n', 'from the necessity of surrendering to civil courts persons arrested\\n', 'under their orders, or even making answers to writs issued from such\\n', 'courts. In the autumn of that year the President, acting under the terms\\n', 'of this law, declared this ancient and honorable instrument for the\\n', 'protection of civil liberties, the _habeas corpus_, suspended throughout\\n', 'the length and breadth of the land. The power of the government was also\\n', 'strengthened by an act defining and punishing certain conspiracies,\\n', 'passed on July 31, 1861--a measure which imposed heavy penalties on\\n', 'those who by force, intimidation, or threat interfered with the\\n', 'execution of the law.\\n', '\\n', 'Thus doubly armed, the military authorities spared no one suspected of\\n', 'active sympathy with the Southern cause. Editors were arrested and\\n', 'imprisoned, their papers suspended, and their newsboys locked up. Those\\n', 'who organized \"peace meetings\" soon found themselves in the toils of the\\n', 'law. Members of the Maryland legislature, the mayor of Baltimore, and\\n', 'local editors suspected of entertaining secessionist opinions, were\\n', 'imprisoned on military orders although charged with no offense, and were\\n', 'denied the privilege of examination before a civil magistrate. A Vermont\\n', 'farmer, too outspoken in his criticism of the government, found himself\\n', 'behind the bars until the government, in its good pleasure, saw fit to\\n', 'release him. These measures were not confined to the theater of war nor\\n', 'to the border states where the spirit of secession was strong enough to\\n', 'endanger the cause of union. They were applied all through the Northern\\n', 'states up to the very boundaries of Canada. Zeal for the national cause,\\n', 'too often supplemented by a zeal for persecution, spread terror among\\n', 'those who wavered in the singleness of their devotion to the union.\\n', '\\n', 'These drastic operations on the part of military authorities, so foreign\\n', 'to the normal course of civilized life, naturally aroused intense and\\n', 'bitter hostility. Meetings of protest were held throughout the country.\\n', 'Thirty-six members of the House of Representatives sought to put on\\n', 'record their condemnation of the suspension of the _habeas corpus_ act,\\n', 'only to meet a firm denial by the supporters of the act. Chief Justice\\n', \"Taney, before whom the case of a man arrested under the President's\\n\", 'military authority was brought, emphatically declared, in a long and\\n', 'learned opinion bristling with historical examples, that the President\\n', 'had no power to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_. In Congress and\\n', 'out, Democrats, abolitionists, and champions of civil liberty denounced\\n', 'Lincoln and his Cabinet in unsparing terms. Vallandigham, a Democratic\\n', 'leader of Ohio, afterward banished to the South for his opposition to\\n', 'the war, constantly applied to Lincoln the epithet of \"Caesar.\" Wendell\\n', 'Phillips saw in him \"a more unlimited despot than the world knows this\\n', 'side of China.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Sensitive to such stinging thrusts and no friend of wanton persecution,\\n', 'Lincoln attempted to mitigate the rigors of the law by paroling many\\n', 'political prisoners. The general policy, however, he defended in homely\\n', 'language, very different in tone and meaning from the involved reasoning\\n', 'of the lawyers. \"Must I shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts,\\n', 'while I must not touch a hair of the wily agitator who induces him to\\n', 'desert?\" he asked in a quiet way of some spokesmen for those who\\n', 'protested against arresting people for \"talking against the war.\" This\\n', 'summed up his philosophy. He was engaged in a war to save the union, and\\n', 'all measures necessary and proper to accomplish that purpose were\\n', 'warranted by the Constitution which he had sworn to uphold.\\n', '\\n', '=Military Strategy--North and South.=--The broad outlines of military\\n', 'strategy followed by the commanders of the opposing forces are clear\\n', 'even to the layman who cannot be expected to master the details of a\\n', 'campaign or, for that matter, the maneuvers of a single great battle.\\n', 'The problem for the South was one of defense mainly, though even for\\n', 'defense swift and paralyzing strokes at the North were later deemed\\n', 'imperative measures. The problem of the North was, to put it baldly, one\\n', 'of invasion and conquest. Southern territory had to be invaded and\\n', 'Southern armies beaten on their own ground or worn down to exhaustion\\n', 'there.\\n', '\\n', 'In the execution of this undertaking, geography, as usual, played a\\n', 'significant part in the disposition of forces. The Appalachian ranges,\\n', 'stretching through the Confederacy to Northern Alabama, divided the\\n', 'campaigns into Eastern and Western enterprises. Both were of signal\\n', 'importance. Victory in the East promised the capture of the Confederate\\n', 'capital of Richmond, a stroke of moral worth, hardly to be\\n', 'overestimated. Victory in the West meant severing the Confederacy and\\n', 'opening the Mississippi Valley down to the Gulf.\\n', '\\n', 'As it turned out, the Western forces accomplished their task first,\\n', 'vindicating the military powers of union soldiers and shaking the\\n', 'confidence of opposing commanders. In February, 1862, Grant captured\\n', 'Fort Donelson on the Tennessee River, rallied wavering unionists in\\n', 'Kentucky, forced the evacuation of Nashville, and opened the way for two\\n', 'hundred miles into the Confederacy. At Shiloh, Murfreesboro, Vicksburg,\\n', 'Chickamauga, Chattanooga, desperate fighting followed and, in spite of\\n', 'varying fortunes, it resulted in the discomfiture and retirement of\\n', 'Confederate forces to the Southeast into Georgia. By the middle of 1863,\\n', 'the Mississippi Valley was open to the Gulf, the initiative taken out of\\n', 'the hands of Southern commanders in the West, and the way prepared for\\n', \"Sherman's final stroke--the march from Atlanta to the sea--a maneuver\\n\", 'executed with needless severity in the autumn of 1864.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: GENERAL ULYSSES S.

He takes the irritating message and with his own hand\\n', 'strikes out, erases, tones down, and interlines, exchanging for words\\n', 'that sting and burn the language of prudence and caution. Is it a matter\\n', 'of compromise with the South, so often proposed by men on both sides\\n', 'sick of carnage? Lincoln is always ready to listen and turns away only\\n', 'when he is invited to surrender principles essential to the safety of\\n', 'the union. Is it high strategy of war, a question of the general best\\n', 'fitted to win Gettysburg--Hooker, Sedgwick, or Meade? Lincoln goes in\\n', 'person to the War Department in the dead of night to take counsel with\\n', 'his Secretary and to make the fateful choice.\\n', '\\n', 'Is it a complaint from a citizen, deprived, as he believes, of his civil\\n', 'liberties unjustly or in violation of the Constitution? Lincoln is ready\\n', 'to hear it and anxious to afford relief, if warrant can be found for it.\\n', 'Is a mother begging for the life of a son sentenced to be shot as a\\n', 'deserter? Lincoln hears her petition, and grants it even against the\\n', 'protests made by his generals in the name of military discipline. Do\\n', 'politicians sow dissensions in the army and among civilians? Lincoln\\n', 'grandly waves aside their petty personalities and invites them to think\\n', 'of the greater cause. Is it a question of securing votes to ratify the\\n', 'thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery? Lincoln thinks it not beneath\\n', 'his dignity to traffic and huckster with politicians over the trifling\\n', 'jobs asked in return by the members who hold out against him. Does a New\\n', \"York newspaper call him an ignorant Western boor? Lincoln's reply is a\\n\", 'letter to a mother who has given her all--her sons on the field of\\n', 'battle--and an address at Gettysburg, both of which will live as long as\\n', 'the tongue in which they were written. These are tributes not only to\\n', 'his mastery of the English language but also to his mastery of all those\\n', 'sentiments of sweetness and strength which are the finest flowers of\\n', 'culture.\\n', '\\n', 'Throughout the entire span of service, however, Lincoln was beset by\\n', 'merciless critics. The fiery apostles of abolition accused him of\\n', 'cowardice when he delayed the bold stroke at slavery. Anti-war Democrats\\n', 'lashed out at every step he took. Even in his own party he found no\\n', 'peace. Charles Sumner complained: \"Our President is now dictator,\\n', '_imperator_--whichever you like; but how vain to have the power of a\\n', 'god and not to use it godlike.\" Leaders among the Republicans sought to\\n', 'put him aside in 1864 and place Chase in his chair. \"I hope we may never\\n', 'have a worse man,\" was Lincoln\\'s quiet answer.\\n', '\\n', 'Wide were the dissensions in the North during that year and the\\n', 'Republicans, while selecting Lincoln as their candidate again, cast off\\n', 'their old name and chose the simple title of the \"Union party.\"\\n', 'Moreover, they selected a Southern man, Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, to\\n', 'be associated with him as candidate for Vice President. This combination\\n', 'the Northern Democrats boldly confronted with a platform declaring that\\n', '\"after four years of failure to restore the union by the experiment of\\n', 'war, during which, under the pretence of military necessity or war power\\n', 'higher than the Constitution, the Constitution itself has been\\n', 'disregarded in every part and public liberty and private right alike\\n', 'trodden down ... justice, humanity, liberty, and public welfare demand\\n', 'that immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities, to the\\n', 'end that peace may be restored on the basis of the federal union of the\\n', 'states.\" It is true that the Democratic candidate, General McClellan,\\n', 'sought to break the yoke imposed upon him by the platform, saying that\\n', 'he could not look his old comrades in the face and pronounce their\\n', 'efforts vain; but the party call to the nation to repudiate Lincoln and\\n', 'his works had gone forth. The response came, giving Lincoln 2,200,000\\n', 'votes against 1,800,000 for his opponent. The bitter things said about\\n', 'him during the campaign, he forgot and forgave. When in April, 1865, he\\n', \"was struck down by the assassin's hand, he above all others in\\n\", 'Washington was planning measures of moderation and healing.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE RESULTS OF THE CIVIL WAR\\n', '\\n', 'There is a strong and natural tendency on the part of writers to stress\\n', 'the dramatic and heroic aspects of war; but the long judgment of history\\n', 'requires us to include all other significant phases as well. Like every\\n', 'great armed conflict, the Civil War outran the purposes of those who\\n', 'took part in it. Waged over the nature of the union, it made a\\n', 'revolution in the union, changing public policies and constitutional\\n', 'principles and giving a new direction to agriculture and industry.\\n', '\\n', '=The Supremacy of the Union.=--First and foremost, the war settled for\\n', 'all time the long dispute as to the nature of the federal system. The\\n', 'doctrine of state sovereignty was laid to rest. Men might still speak of\\n', 'the rights of states and think of their commonwealths with affection,\\n', 'but nullification and secession were destroyed. The nation was supreme.\\n', '\\n', '=The Destruction of the Slave Power.=--Next to the vindication of\\n', 'national supremacy was the destruction of the planting aristocracy of\\n', 'the South--that great power which had furnished leadership of undoubted\\n', 'ability and had so long contested with the industrial and commercial\\n', 'interests of the North. The first paralyzing blow at the planters was\\n', 'struck by the abolition of slavery. The second and third came with the\\n', 'fourteenth (1868) and fifteenth (1870) amendments, giving the ballot to\\n', 'freedmen and excluding from public office the Confederate\\n', 'leaders--driving from the work of reconstruction the finest talents of\\n', 'the South. As if to add bitterness to gall and wormwood, the fourteenth\\n', 'amendment forbade the United States or any state to pay any debts\\n', 'incurred in aid of the Confederacy or in the emancipation of the\\n', 'slaves--plunging into utter bankruptcy the Southern financiers who had\\n', 'stripped their section of capital to support their cause. So the\\n', 'Southern planters found themselves excluded from public office and ruled\\n', 'over by their former bondmen under the tutelage of Republican leaders.\\n', 'Their labor system was wrecked and their money and bonds were as\\n', 'worthless as waste paper. The South was subject to the North. That which\\n', 'neither the Federalists nor the Whigs had been able to accomplish in the\\n', 'realm of statecraft was accomplished on the field of battle.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Triumph of Industry.=--The wreck of the planting system was\\n', 'accompanied by a mighty upswing of Northern industry which made the old\\n', 'Whigs of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania stare in wonderment. The demands\\n', 'of the federal government for manufactured goods at unrestricted prices\\n', 'gave a stimulus to business which more than replaced the lost markets of\\n', 'the South. Between 1860 and 1870 the number of manufacturing\\n', 'establishments increased 79.6 per cent as against 14.2 for the previous\\n', 'decade; while the number of persons employed almost doubled. There was\\n', 'no doubt about the future of American industry.\\n', '\\n', '=The Victory for the Protective Tariff.=--Moreover, it was henceforth to\\n', 'be well protected. For many years before the war the friends of\\n', 'protection had been on the defensive. The tariff act of 1857 imposed\\n', 'duties so low as to presage a tariff for revenue only. The war changed\\n', 'all that. The extraordinary military expenditures, requiring heavy taxes\\n', 'on all sources, justified tariffs so high that a follower of Clay or\\n', 'Webster might well have gasped with astonishment. After the war was over\\n', 'the debt remained and both interest and principal had to be paid.\\n', 'Protective arguments based on economic reasoning were supported by a\\n', 'plain necessity for revenue which admitted no dispute.\\n', '\\n', '=A Liberal Immigration Policy.=--Linked with industry was the labor\\n', 'supply. The problem of manning industries became a pressing matter, and\\n', 'Republican leaders grappled with it. In the platform of the Union party\\n', 'adopted in 1864 it was declared \"that foreign immigration, which in the\\n', 'past has added so much to the wealth, the development of resources, and\\n', 'the increase of power to this nation--the asylum of the oppressed of all\\n', 'nations--should be fostered and encouraged by a liberal and just\\n', 'policy.\" In that very year Congress, recognizing the importance of the\\n', 'problem, passed a measure of high significance, creating a bureau of\\n', 'immigration, and authorizing a modified form of indentured labor, by\\n', 'making it legal for immigrants to pledge their wages in advance to pay\\n', 'their passage over. Though the bill was soon repealed, the practice\\n', 'authorized by it was long continued. The cheapness of the passage\\n', 'shortened the term of service; but the principle was older than the\\n', 'days of William Penn.\\n', '\\n', '=The Homestead Act of 1862.=--In the immigration measure guaranteeing a\\n', 'continuous and adequate labor supply, the manufacturers saw an offset to\\n', 'the Homestead Act of 1862 granting free lands to settlers. The Homestead\\n', 'law they had resisted in a long and bitter congressional battle.\\n', 'Naturally, they had not taken kindly to a scheme which lured men away\\n', 'from the factories or enabled them to make unlimited demands for higher\\n', 'wages as the price of remaining. Southern planters likewise had feared\\n', 'free homesteads for the very good reason that they only promised to add\\n', 'to the overbalancing power of the North.\\n', '\\n', 'In spite of the opposition, supporters of a liberal land policy made\\n', 'steady gains. Free-soil Democrats,--Jacksonian farmers and\\n', 'mechanics,--labor reformers, and political leaders, like Stephen A.\\n', 'Douglas of Illinois and Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, kept up the\\n', 'agitation in season and out. More than once were they able to force a\\n', 'homestead bill through the House of Representatives only to have it\\n', 'blocked in the Senate where Southern interests were intrenched. Then,\\n', 'after the Senate was won over, a Democratic President, James Buchanan,\\n', 'vetoed the bill. Still the issue lived. The Republicans, strong among\\n', 'the farmers of the Northwest, favored it from the beginning and pressed\\n', 'it upon the attention of the country. Finally the manufacturers yielded;\\n', 'they received their compensation in the contract labor law. In 1862\\n', 'Congress provided for the free distribution of land in 160-acre lots\\n', 'among men and women of strong arms and willing hearts ready to build\\n', 'their serried lines of homesteads to the Rockies and beyond.\\n', '\\n', '=Internal Improvements.=--If farmers and manufacturers were early\\n', 'divided on the matter of free homesteads, the same could hardly be said\\n', 'of internal improvements. The Western tiller of the soil was as eager\\n', 'for some easy way of sending his produce to market as the manufacturer\\n', 'was for the same means to transport his goods to the consumer on the\\n', 'farm. While the Confederate leaders were writing into their\\n', 'constitution a clause forbidding all appropriations for internal\\n', 'improvements, the Republican leaders at Washington were planning such\\n', 'expenditures from the treasury in the form of public land grants to\\n', 'railways as would have dazed the authors of the national road bill half\\n', 'a century earlier.\\n', '\\n', \"=Sound Finance--National Banking.=--From Hamilton's day to Lincoln's,\\n\", 'business men in the East had contended for a sound system of national\\n', 'currency. The experience of the states with paper money, painfully\\n', 'impressive in the years before the framing of the Constitution, had been\\n', 'convincing to those who understood the economy of business. The\\n', 'Constitution, as we have seen, bore the signs of this experience. States\\n', 'were forbidden to emit bills of credit: paper money, in short. This\\n', 'provision stood clear in the document; but judicial ingenuity had\\n', 'circumvented it in the age of Jacksonian Democracy. The states had\\n', 'enacted and the Supreme Court, after the death of John Marshall, had\\n', 'sustained laws chartering banking companies and authorizing them to\\n', 'issue paper money. So the country was beset by the old curse, the banks\\n', 'of Western and Southern states issuing reams of paper notes to help\\n', 'borrowers pay their debts.\\n', '\\n', 'In dealing with war finances, the Republicans attacked this ancient\\n', 'evil. By act of Congress in 1864, they authorized a series of national\\n', 'banks founded on the credit of government bonds and empowered to issue\\n', 'notes. The next year they stopped all bank paper sent forth under the\\n', 'authority of the states by means of a prohibitive tax. In this way, by\\n', 'two measures Congress restored federal control over the monetary system\\n', 'although it did not reestablish the United States Bank so hated by\\n', 'Jacksonian Democracy.\\n', '\\n', \"=Destruction of States' Rights by Fourteenth Amendment.=--These acts and\\n\", 'others not cited here were measures of centralization and consolidation\\n', 'at the expense of the powers and dignity of the states. They were all of\\n', 'high import, but the crowning act of nationalism was the fourteenth\\n', 'amendment which, among other things, forbade states to \"deprive any\\n', 'person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\" The\\n', 'immediate occasion, though not the actual cause of this provision, was\\n', 'the need for protecting the rights of freedmen against hostile\\n', 'legislatures in the South. The result of the amendment, as was\\n', 'prophesied in protests loud and long from every quarter of the\\n', 'Democratic party, was the subjection of every act of state, municipal,\\n', 'and county authorities to possible annulment by the Supreme Court at\\n', 'Washington. The expected happened.\\n', '\\n', 'Few negroes ever brought cases under the fourteenth amendment to the\\n', 'attention of the courts; but thousands of state laws, municipal\\n', 'ordinances, and acts of local authorities were set aside as null and\\n', 'void under it. Laws of states regulating railway rates, fixing hours of\\n', 'labor in bakeshops, and taxing corporations were in due time to be\\n', 'annulled as conflicting with an amendment erroneously supposed to be\\n', 'designed solely for the protection of negroes. As centralized power over\\n', 'tariffs, railways, public lands, and other national concerns went to\\n', 'Congress, so centralized power over the acts of state and local\\n', 'authorities involving an infringement of personal and property rights\\n', 'was conferred on the federal judiciary, the apex of which was the\\n', 'Supreme Court at Washington. Thus the old federation of \"independent\\n', 'states,\" all equal in rights and dignity, each wearing the \"jewel of\\n', 'sovereignty\" so celebrated in Southern oratory, had gone the way of all\\n', 'flesh under the withering blasts of Civil War.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'RECONSTRUCTION IN THE SOUTH\\n', '\\n', '=Theories about the Position of the Seceded States.=--On the morning of\\n', 'April 9, 1865, when General Lee surrendered his army to General Grant,\\n', 'eleven states stood in a peculiar relation to the union now declared\\n', 'perpetual. Lawyers and political philosophers were much perturbed and\\n', 'had been for some time as to what should be done with the members of the\\n', 'former Confederacy. Radical Republicans held that they were \"conquered\\n', 'provinces\" at the mercy of Congress, to be governed under such laws as\\n', 'it saw fit to enact and until in its wisdom it decided to readmit any or\\n', 'all of them to the union. Men of more conservative views held that, as\\n', 'the war had been waged by the North on the theory that no state could\\n', 'secede from the union, the Confederate states had merely attempted to\\n', 'withdraw and had failed. The corollary of this latter line of argument\\n', 'was simple: \"The Southern states are still in the union and it is the\\n', 'duty of the President, as commander-in-chief, to remove the federal\\n', 'troops as soon as order is restored and the state governments ready to\\n', 'function once more as usual.\"\\n', '\\n', \"=Lincoln's Proposal.=--Some such simple and conservative form of\\n\", 'reconstruction had been suggested by Lincoln in a proclamation of\\n', 'December 8, 1863. He proposed pardon and a restoration of property,\\n', 'except in slaves, to nearly all who had \"directly or by implication\\n', 'participated in the existing rebellion,\" on condition that they take an\\n', 'oath of loyalty to the union. He then announced that when, in any of the\\n', 'states named, a body of voters, qualified under the law as it stood\\n', 'before secession and equal in number to one-tenth the votes cast in\\n', '1860, took the oath of allegiance, they should be permitted to\\n', 'reestablish a state government. Such a government, he added, should be\\n', 'recognized as a lawful authority and entitled to protection under the\\n', 'federal Constitution. With reference to the status of the former slaves\\n', 'Lincoln made it clear that, while their freedom must be recognized, he\\n', 'would not object to any legislation \"which may yet be consistent as a\\n', 'temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring,\\n', 'landless, and homeless class.\"\\n', '\\n', \"=Andrew Johnson's Plan--His Impeachment.=--Lincoln's successor, Andrew\\n\", 'Johnson, the Vice President, soon after taking office, proposed to\\n', 'pursue a somewhat similar course. In a number of states he appointed\\n', 'military governors, instructing them at the earliest possible moment to\\n', 'assemble conventions, chosen \"by that portion of the people of the said\\n', 'states who are loyal to the United States,\" and proceed to the\\n', 'organization of regular civil government. Johnson, a Southern man and a\\n', 'Democrat, was immediately charged by the Republicans with being too\\n', 'ready to restore the Southern states. As the months went by, the\\n', 'opposition to his measures and policies in Congress grew in size and\\n', 'bitterness. The contest resulted in the impeachment of Johnson by the\\n', 'House of Representatives in March, 1868, and his acquittal by the Senate\\n', 'merely because his opponents lacked one vote of the two-thirds required\\n', 'for conviction.\\n', '\\n', '=Congress Enacts \"Reconstruction Laws.\"=--In fact, Congress was in a\\n', 'strategic position. It was the law-making body, and it could, moreover,\\n', 'determine the conditions under which Senators and Representatives from\\n', 'the South were to be readmitted. It therefore proceeded to pass a series\\n', \"of reconstruction acts--carrying all of them over Johnson's veto. These\\n\", 'measures, the first of which became a law on March 2, 1867, betrayed an\\n', \"animus not found anywhere in Lincoln's plans or Johnson's proclamations.\\n\", '\\n', 'They laid off the ten states--the whole Confederacy with the exception\\n', 'of Tennessee--still outside the pale, into five military districts, each\\n', 'commanded by a military officer appointed by the President. They ordered\\n', 'the commanding general to prepare a register of voters for the election\\n', 'of delegates to conventions chosen for the purpose of drafting new\\n', 'constitutions. Such voters, however, were not to be, as Lincoln had\\n', 'suggested, loyal persons duly qualified under the law existing before\\n', 'secession but \"the male citizens of said state, twenty-one years old and\\n', 'upward, of whatever race, color, or previous condition, ... except such\\n', 'as may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion or for felony\\n', 'at common law.\" This was the death knell to the idea that the leaders of\\n', 'the Confederacy and their white supporters might be permitted to share\\n', 'in the establishment of the new order. Power was thus arbitrarily thrust\\n', 'into the hands of the newly emancipated male negroes and the handful of\\n', 'whites who could show a record of loyalty. That was not all. Each state\\n', 'was, under the reconstruction acts, compelled to ratify the fourteenth\\n', 'amendment to the federal Constitution as a price of restoration to the\\n', 'union.\\n', '\\n', 'The composition of the conventions thus authorized may be imagined.\\n', 'Bondmen without the asking and without preparation found themselves the\\n', 'governing power. An army of adventurers from the North, \"carpet baggers\"\\n', 'as they were called, poured in upon the scene to aid in\\n', '\"reconstruction.\" Undoubtedly many men of honor and fine intentions gave\\n', 'unstinted service, but the results of their deliberations only\\n', 'aggravated the open wound left by the war. Any number of political\\n', 'doctors offered their prescriptions; but no effective remedy could be\\n', 'found. Under measures admittedly open to grave objections, the Southern\\n', 'states were one after another restored to the union by the grace of\\n', 'Congress, the last one in 1870. Even this grudging concession of the\\n', 'formalities of statehood did not mean a full restoration of honors and\\n', 'privileges. The last soldier was not withdrawn from the last Southern\\n', 'capital until 1877, and federal control over elections long remained as\\n', 'a sign of congressional supremacy.\\n', '\\n', '=The Status of the Freedmen.=--Even more intricate than the issues\\n', 'involved in restoring the seceded states to the union was the question\\n', 'of what to do with the newly emancipated slaves. That problem, often put\\n', 'to abolitionists before the war, had become at last a real concern. The\\n', 'thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery had not touched it at all. It\\n', 'declared bondmen free, but did nothing to provide them with work or\\n', 'homes and did not mention the subject of political rights. All these\\n', 'matters were left to the states, and the legislatures of some of them,\\n', 'by their famous \"black codes,\" restored a form of servitude under the\\n', 'guise of vagrancy and apprentice laws. Such methods were in fact partly\\n', \"responsible for the reaction that led Congress to abandon Lincoln's\\n\", 'policies and undertake its own program of reconstruction.\\n', '\\n', 'Still no extensive effort was made to solve by law the economic problems\\n', 'of the bondmen. Radical abolitionists had advocated that the slaves when\\n', 'emancipated should be given outright the fields of their former\\n', 'masters; but Congress steadily rejected the very idea of confiscation.\\n', 'The necessity of immediate assistance it recognized by creating in 1865\\n', \"the Freedmen's Bureau to take care of refugees. It authorized the issue\\n\", 'of food and clothing to the destitute and the renting of abandoned and\\n', 'certain other lands under federal control to former slaves at reasonable\\n', 'rates. But the larger problem of the relation of the freedmen to the\\n', 'land, it left to the slow working of time.\\n', '\\n', 'Against sharp protests from conservative men, particularly among the\\n', 'Democrats, Congress did insist, however, on conferring upon the freedmen\\n', 'certain rights by national law. These rights fell into broad divisions,\\n', 'civil and political. By an act passed in 1866, Congress gave to former\\n', 'slaves the rights of white citizens in the matter of making contracts,\\n', 'giving testimony in courts, and purchasing, selling, and leasing\\n', 'property. As it was doubtful whether Congress had the power to enact\\n', 'this law, there was passed and submitted to the states the fourteenth\\n', 'amendment which gave citizenship to the freedmen, assured them of the\\n', 'privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, and declared\\n', 'that no state should deprive any person of his life, liberty, or\\n', 'property without due process of law. Not yet satisfied, Congress\\n', 'attempted to give social equality to negroes by the second civil rights\\n', 'bill of 1875 which promised to them, among other things, the full and\\n', 'equal enjoyment of inns, theaters, public conveyances, and places of\\n', 'amusement--a law later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\\n', '\\n', 'The matter of political rights was even more hotly contested; but the\\n', 'radical Republicans, like Charles Sumner, asserted that civil rights\\n', 'were not secure unless supported by the suffrage. In this same\\n', 'fourteenth amendment they attempted to guarantee the ballot to all negro\\n', 'men, leaving the women to take care of themselves. The amendment\\n', 'declared in effect that when any state deprived adult male citizens of\\n', 'the right to vote, its representation in Congress should be reduced in\\n', 'the proportion such persons bore to the voting population.\\n', '\\n', 'This provision having failed to accomplish its purpose, the fifteenth\\n', 'amendment was passed and ratified, expressly declaring that no citizen\\n', 'should be deprived of the right to vote \"on account of race, color, or\\n', 'previous condition of servitude.\" To make assurance doubly secure,\\n', 'Congress enacted in 1870, 1872, and 1873 three drastic laws, sometimes\\n', 'known as \"force bills,\" providing for the use of federal authorities,\\n', 'civil and military, in supervising elections in all parts of the Union.\\n', 'So the federal government, having destroyed chattel slavery, sought by\\n', 'legal decree to sweep away all its signs and badges, civil, social, and\\n', 'political. Never, save perhaps in some of the civil conflicts of Greece\\n', 'or Rome, had there occurred in the affairs of a nation a social\\n', 'revolution so complete, so drastic, and far-reaching in its results.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SUMMARY OF THE SECTIONAL CONFLICT\\n', '\\n', 'Just as the United States, under the impetus of Western enterprise,\\n', 'rounded out the continental domain, its very existence as a nation was\\n', 'challenged by a fratricidal conflict between two sections. This storm\\n', 'had been long gathering upon the horizon. From the very beginning in\\n', 'colonial times there had been a marked difference between the South and\\n', 'the North. The former by climate and soil was dedicated to a planting\\n', 'system--the cultivation of tobacco, rice, cotton, and sugar cane--and in\\n', 'the course of time slave labor became the foundation of the system. The\\n', 'North, on the other hand, supplemented agriculture by commerce, trade,\\n', 'and manufacturing. Slavery, though lawful, did not flourish there. An\\n', 'abundant supply of free labor kept the Northern wheels turning.\\n', '\\n', 'This difference between the two sections, early noted by close\\n', 'observers, was increased with the advent of the steam engine and the\\n', 'factory system. Between 1815 and 1860 an industrial revolution took\\n', 'place in the North. Its signs were gigantic factories, huge aggregations\\n', 'of industrial workers, immense cities, a flourishing commerce, and\\n', 'prosperous banks. Finding an unfavorable reception in the South, the new\\n', 'industrial system was confined mainly to the North. By canals and\\n', 'railways New York, Boston, and Philadelphia were linked with the\\n', 'wheatfields of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. A steel net wove North and\\n', 'Northwest together. A commercial net supplemented it. Western trade was\\n', 'diverted from New Orleans to the East and Eastern credit sustained\\n', 'Western enterprise.\\n', '\\n', 'In time, the industrial North and the planting South evolved different\\n', 'ideas of political policy. The former looked with favor on protective\\n', 'tariffs, ship subsidies, a sound national banking system, and internal\\n', 'improvements. The farmers of the West demanded that the public domain be\\n', 'divided up into free homesteads for farmers. The South steadily swung\\n', 'around to the opposite view. Its spokesmen came to regard most of these\\n', 'policies as injurious to the planting interests.\\n', '\\n', 'The economic questions were all involved in a moral issue. The Northern\\n', 'states, in which slavery was of slight consequence, had early abolished\\n', 'the institution. In the course of a few years there appeared\\n', 'uncompromising advocates of universal emancipation. Far and wide the\\n', 'agitation spread. The South was thoroughly frightened. It demanded\\n', 'protection against the agitators, the enforcement of its rights in the\\n', 'case of runaway slaves, and equal privileges for slavery in the new\\n', 'territories.\\n', '\\n', 'With the passing years the conflict between the two sections increased\\n', 'in bitterness. It flamed up in 1820 and was allayed by the Missouri\\n', 'compromise. It took on the form of a tariff controversy and\\n', 'nullification in 1832. It appeared again after the Mexican war when the\\n', 'question of slavery in the new territories was raised. Again\\n', 'compromise--the great settlement of 1850--seemed to restore peace, only\\n', 'to prove an illusion. A series of startling events swept the country\\n', 'into war: the repeal of the Missouri compromise in 1854, the rise of the\\n', 'Republican party pledged to the prohibition of slavery in the\\n', 'territories, the Dred Scott decision of 1857, the Lincoln-Douglas\\n', \"debates, John Brown's raid, the election of Lincoln, and secession.\\n\", '\\n', 'The Civil War, lasting for four years, tested the strength of both North\\n', 'and South, in leadership, in finance, in diplomatic skill, in material\\n', 'resources, in industry, and in armed forces. By the blockade of Southern\\n', 'ports, by an overwhelming weight of men and materials, and by relentless\\n', 'hammering on the field of battle, the North was victorious.\\n', '\\n', 'The results of the war were revolutionary in character. Slavery was\\n', 'abolished and the freedmen given the ballot. The Southern planters who\\n', 'had been the leaders of their section were ruined financially and almost\\n', 'to a man excluded from taking part in political affairs. The union was\\n', 'declared to be perpetual and the right of a state to secede settled by\\n', 'the judgment of battle. Federal control over the affairs of states,\\n', 'counties, and cities was established by the fourteenth amendment. The\\n', 'power and prestige of the federal government were enhanced beyond\\n', 'imagination. The North was now free to pursue its economic policies: a\\n', 'protective tariff, a national banking system, land grants for railways,\\n', 'free lands for farmers.

NATIONAL GROWTH AND WORLD POLITICS\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER XVI\\n', '\\n', 'THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC EVOLUTION OF THE SOUTH\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The outcome of the Civil War in the South was nothing short of a\\n', 'revolution. The ruling class, the law, and the government of the old\\n', 'order had been subverted. To political chaos was added the havoc wrought\\n', 'in agriculture, business, and transportation by military operations. And\\n', 'as if to fill the cup to the brim, the task of reconstruction was\\n', 'committed to political leaders from another section of the country,\\n', 'strangers to the life and traditions of the South.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE SOUTH AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR\\n', '\\n', '=A Ruling Class Disfranchised.=--As the sovereignty of the planters had\\n', 'been the striking feature of the old regime, so their ruin was the\\n', 'outstanding fact of the new. The situation was extraordinary. The\\n', 'American Revolution was carried out by people experienced in the arts of\\n', 'self-government, and at its close they were free to follow the general\\n', 'course to which they had long been accustomed. The French Revolution\\n', 'witnessed the overthrow of the clergy and the nobility; but middle\\n', 'classes who took their places had been steadily rising in intelligence\\n', 'and wealth.\\n', '\\n', 'The Southern Revolution was unlike either of these cataclysms. It was\\n', 'not brought about by a social upheaval, but by an external crisis. It\\n', 'did not enfranchise a class that sought and understood power, but\\n', 'bondmen who had played no part in the struggle. Moreover it struck down\\n', 'a class equipped to rule. The leading planters were almost to a man\\n', 'excluded from state and federal offices, and the fourteenth amendment\\n', 'was a bar to their return. All civil and military places under the\\n', 'authority of the United States and of the states were closed to every\\n', 'man who had taken an oath to support the Constitution as a member of\\n', 'Congress, as a state legislator, or as a state or federal officer, and\\n', 'afterward engaged in \"insurrection or rebellion,\" or \"given aid and\\n', 'comfort to the enemies\" of the United States. This sweeping provision,\\n', 'supplemented by the reconstruction acts, laid under the ban most of the\\n', 'talent, energy, and spirit of the South.\\n', '\\n', '=The Condition of the State Governments.=--The legislative, executive,\\n', 'and judicial branches of the state governments thus passed into the\\n', 'control of former slaves, led principally by Northern adventurers or\\n', 'Southern novices, known as \"Scalawags.\" The result was a carnival of\\n', 'waste, folly, and corruption. The \"reconstruction\" assembly of South\\n', 'Carolina bought clocks at $480 apiece and chandeliers at $650. To\\n', 'purchase land for former bondmen the sum of $800,000 was appropriated;\\n', 'and swamps bought at seventy-five cents an acre were sold to the state\\n', 'at five times the cost. In the years between 1868 and 1873, the debt of\\n', 'the state rose from about $5,800,000 to $24,000,000, and millions of the\\n', 'increase could not be accounted for by the authorities responsible for\\n', 'it.\\n', '\\n', '=Economic Ruin--Urban and Rural.=--No matter where Southern men turned\\n', 'in 1865 they found devastation--in the towns, in the country, and along\\n', 'the highways. Atlanta, the city to which Sherman applied the torch, lay\\n', 'in ashes; Nashville and Chattanooga had been partially wrecked; Richmond\\n', 'and Augusta had suffered severely from fires. Charleston was described\\n', 'by a visitor as \"a city of ruins, of desolation, of vacant houses, of\\n', 'rotten wharves, of deserted warehouses, of weed gardens, of miles of\\n', 'grass-grown streets.... How few young men there are, how generally the\\n', 'young women are dressed in black! The flower of their proud aristocracy\\n', 'is buried on scores of battle fields.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Those who journeyed through the country about the same time reported\\n', 'desolation equally widespread and equally pathetic. An English traveler\\n', 'who made his way along the course of the Tennessee River in 1870 wrote:\\n', '\"The trail of war is visible throughout the valley in burnt-up gin\\n', 'houses, ruined bridges, mills, and factories ... and large tracts of\\n', 'once cultivated land are stripped of every vestige of fencing. The\\n', 'roads, long neglected, are in disorder and, having in many places become\\n', 'impassable, new tracks have been made through the woods and fields\\n', 'without much respect to boundaries.\" Many a great plantation had been\\n', 'confiscated by the federal authorities while the owner was in\\n', 'Confederate service. Many more lay in waste. In the wake of the armies\\n', 'the homes of rich and poor alike, if spared the torch, had been\\n', 'despoiled of the stock and seeds necessary to renew agriculture.\\n', '\\n', '=Railways Dilapidated.=--Transportation was still more demoralized. This\\n', 'is revealed in the pages of congressional reports based upon first-hand\\n', 'investigations. One eloquent passage illustrates all the rest. From\\n', 'Pocahontas to Decatur, Alabama, a distance of 114 miles, we are told,\\n', 'the railroad was \"almost entirely destroyed, except the road bed and\\n', 'iron rails, and they were in a very bad condition--every bridge and\\n', 'trestle destroyed, cross-ties rotten, buildings burned, water tanks\\n', 'gone, tracks grown up in weeds and bushes, not a saw mill near the line\\n', 'and the labor system of the country gone. About forty miles of the track\\n', 'were burned, the cross-ties entirely destroyed, and the rails bent and\\n', 'twisted in such a manner as to require great labor to straighten and a\\n', 'large portion of them requiring renewal.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Capital and Credit Destroyed.=--The fluid capital of the South, money\\n', 'and credit, was in the same prostrate condition as the material capital.\\n', 'The Confederate currency, inflated to the bursting point, had utterly\\n', 'collapsed and was as worthless as waste paper. The bonds of the\\n', 'Confederate government were equally valueless. Specie had nearly\\n', 'disappeared from circulation. The fourteenth amendment to the federal\\n', 'Constitution had made all \"debts, obligations, and claims\" incurred in\\n', 'aid of the Confederate cause \"illegal and void.\" Millions of dollars\\n', 'owed to Northern creditors before the war were overdue and payment was\\n', 'pressed upon the debtors. Where such debts were secured by mortgages on\\n', 'land, executions against the property could be obtained in federal\\n', 'courts.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE RESTORATION OF WHITE SUPREMACY\\n', '\\n', '=Intimidation.=--In both politics and economics, the process of\\n', 'reconstruction in the South was slow and arduous. The first battle in\\n', 'the political contest for white supremacy was won outside the halls of\\n', 'legislatures and the courts of law. It was waged, in the main, by secret\\n', 'organizations, among which the Ku Klux Klan and the White Camelia were\\n', 'the most prominent. The first of these societies appeared in Tennessee\\n', 'in 1866 and held its first national convention the following year. It\\n', 'was in origin a social club. According to its announcement, its objects\\n', 'were \"to protect the weak, the innocent, and the defenceless from the\\n', 'indignities, wrongs, and outrages of the lawless, the violent, and the\\n', 'brutal; and to succor the suffering, especially the widows and orphans\\n', 'of the Confederate soldiers.\" The whole South was called \"the Empire\"\\n', 'and was ruled by a \"Grand Wizard.\" Each state was a realm and each\\n', 'county a province. In the secret orders there were enrolled over half a\\n', 'million men.\\n', '\\n', 'The methods of the Ku Klux and the White Camelia were similar. Solemn\\n', 'parades of masked men on horses decked in long robes were held,\\n', 'sometimes in the daytime and sometimes at the dead of night. Notices\\n', 'were sent to obnoxious persons warning them to stop certain practices.\\n', 'If warning failed, something more convincing was tried. Fright was the\\n', 'emotion most commonly stirred. A horseman, at the witching hour of\\n', 'midnight, would ride up to the house of some offender, lift his head\\n', 'gear, take off a skull, and hand it to the trembling victim with the\\n', 'request that he hold it for a few minutes. Frequently violence was\\n', 'employed either officially or unofficially by members of the Klan. Tar\\n', 'and feathers were freely applied; the whip was sometimes laid on\\n', 'unmercifully, and occasionally a brutal murder was committed. Often the\\n', 'members were fired upon from bushes or behind trees, and swift\\n', 'retaliation followed. So alarming did the clashes become that in 1870\\n', 'Congress forbade interference with electors or going in disguise for the\\n', 'purpose of obstructing the exercise of the rights enjoyed under federal\\n', 'law.\\n', '\\n', 'In anticipation of such a step on the part of the federal government,\\n', 'the Ku Klux was officially dissolved by the \"Grand Wizard\" in 1869.\\n', 'Nevertheless, the local societies continued their organization and\\n', 'methods. The spirit survived the national association. \"On the whole,\"\\n', 'says a Southern writer, \"it is not easy to see what other course was\\n', 'open to the South.... Armed resistance was out of the question. And yet\\n', 'there must be some control had of the situation.... If force was denied,\\n', 'craft was inevitable.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Struggle for the Ballot Box.=--The effects of intimidation were\\n', 'soon seen at elections. The freedman, into whose inexperienced hand the\\n', 'ballot had been thrust, was ordinarily loath to risk his head by the\\n', 'exercise of his new rights. He had not attained them by a long and\\n', 'laborious contest of his own and he saw no urgent reason why he should\\n', 'battle for the privilege of using them. The mere show of force, the mere\\n', 'existence of a threat, deterred thousands of ex-slaves from appearing at\\n', 'the polls. Thus the whites steadily recovered their dominance. Nothing\\n', 'could prevent it. Congress enacted force bills establishing federal\\n', 'supervision of elections and the Northern politicians protested against\\n', 'the return of former Confederates to practical, if not official, power;\\n', 'but all such opposition was like resistance to the course of nature.\\n', '\\n', '=Amnesty for Southerners.=--The recovery of white supremacy in this way\\n', 'was quickly felt in national councils. The Democratic party in the North\\n', 'welcomed it as a sign of its return to power. The more moderate\\n', 'Republicans, anxious to heal the breach in American unity, sought to\\n', 'encourage rather than to repress it. So it came about that amnesty for\\n', 'Confederates was widely advocated. Yet it must be said that the struggle\\n', 'for the removal of disabilities was stubborn and bitter. Lincoln, with\\n', 'characteristic generosity, in the midst of the war had issued a general\\n', 'proclamation of amnesty to nearly all who had been in arms against the\\n', 'Union, on condition that they take an oath of loyalty; but Johnson,\\n', 'vindictive toward Southern leaders and determined to make \"treason\\n', 'infamous,\" had extended the list of exceptions. Congress, even more\\n', 'relentless in its pursuit of Confederates, pushed through the fourteenth\\n', 'amendment which worked the sweeping disabilities we have just described.\\n', '\\n', 'To appeals for comprehensive clemency, Congress was at first adamant. In\\n', 'vain did men like Carl Schurz exhort their colleagues to crown their\\n', 'victory in battle with a noble act of universal pardon and oblivion.\\n', 'Congress would not yield. It would grant amnesty in individual cases;\\n', 'for the principle of proscription it stood fast. When finally in 1872,\\n', 'seven years after the surrender at Appomattox, it did pass the general\\n', 'amnesty bill, it insisted on certain exceptions. Confederates who had\\n', 'been members of Congress just before the war, or had served in other\\n', 'high posts, civil or military, under the federal government, were still\\n', 'excluded from important offices. Not until the summer of 1898, when the\\n', 'war with Spain produced once more a union of hearts, did Congress relent\\n', 'and abolish the last of the disabilities imposed on the Confederates.\\n', '\\n', '=The Force Bills Attacked and Nullified.=--The granting of amnesty\\n', 'encouraged the Democrats to redouble their efforts all along the line.\\n', 'In 1874 they captured the House of Representatives and declared war on\\n', 'the \"force bills.\" As a Republican Senate blocked immediate repeal, they\\n', 'resorted to an ingenious parliamentary trick. To the appropriation bill\\n', 'for the support of the army they attached a \"rider,\" or condition, to\\n', 'the effect that no troops should be used to sustain the Republican\\n', 'government in Louisiana. The Senate rejected the proposal. A deadlock\\n', 'ensued and Congress adjourned without making provision for the army.\\n', 'Satisfied with the technical victory, the Democrats let the army bill\\n', 'pass the next session, but kept up their fight on the force laws until\\n', 'they wrung from President Hayes a measure forbidding the use of United\\n', 'States troops in supervising elections. The following year they again\\n', 'had recourse to a rider on the army bill and carried it through, putting\\n', 'an end to the use of money for military control of elections. The\\n', 'reconstruction program was clearly going to pieces, and the Supreme\\n', 'Court helped along the process of dissolution by declaring parts of the\\n', 'laws invalid. In 1878 the Democrats even won a majority in the Senate\\n', 'and returned to power a large number of men once prominent in the\\n', 'Confederate cause.\\n', '\\n', 'The passions of the war by this time were evidently cooling. A new\\n', 'generation of men was coming on the scene. The supremacy of the whites\\n', 'in the South, if not yet complete, was at least assured. Federal\\n', 'marshals, their deputies, and supervisors of elections still possessed\\n', 'authority over the polls, but their strength had been shorn by the\\n', 'withdrawal of United States troops. The war on the remaining remnants of\\n', 'the \"force bills\" lapsed into desultory skirmishing. When in 1894 the\\n', 'last fragment was swept away, the country took little note of the fact.\\n', 'The only task that lay before the Southern leaders was to write in the\\n', 'constitutions of their respective states the provisions of law which\\n', 'would clinch the gains so far secured and establish white supremacy\\n', 'beyond the reach of outside intervention.\\n', '\\n', '=White Supremacy Sealed by New State Constitutions.=--The impetus to\\n', 'this final step was given by the rise of the Populist movement in the\\n', 'South, which sharply divided the whites and in many communities threw\\n', 'the balance of power into the hands of the few colored voters who\\n', 'survived the process of intimidation. Southern leaders now devised new\\n', 'constitutions so constructed as to deprive negroes of the ballot by law.\\n', 'Mississippi took the lead in 1890; South Carolina followed five years\\n', 'later; Louisiana, in 1898; North Carolina, in 1900; Alabama and\\n', 'Maryland, in 1901; and Virginia, in 1902.\\n', '\\n', 'The authors of these measures made no attempt to conceal their purposes.\\n', '\"The intelligent white men of the South,\" said Governor Tillman, \"intend\\n', 'to govern here.\" The fifteenth amendment to the federal Constitution,\\n', 'however, forbade them to deprive any citizen of the right to vote on\\n', 'account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This made\\n', 'necessary the devices of indirection. They were few, simple, and\\n', 'effective. The first and most easily administered was the ingenious\\n', 'provision requiring each prospective voter to read a section of the\\n', 'state constitution or \"understand and explain it\" when read to him by\\n', 'the election officers. As an alternative, the payment of taxes or the\\n', 'ownership of a small amount of property was accepted as a qualification\\n', 'for voting. Southern leaders, unwilling to disfranchise any of the poor\\n', 'white men who had stood side by side with them \"in the dark days of\\n', 'reconstruction,\" also resorted to a famous provision known as \"the\\n', 'grandfather clause.\" This plan admitted to the suffrage any man who did\\n', 'not have either property or educational qualifications, provided he had\\n', 'voted on or before 1867 or was the son or grandson of any such person.\\n', '\\n', 'The devices worked effectively. Of the 147,000 negroes in Mississippi\\n', 'above the age of twenty-one, only about 8600 registered under the\\n', 'constitution of 1890. Louisiana had 127,000 colored voters enrolled in\\n', '1896; under the constitution drafted two years later the registration\\n', 'fell to 5300. An analysis of the figures for South Carolina in 1900\\n', 'indicates that only about one negro out of every hundred adult males of\\n', 'that race took part in elections. Thus was closed this chapter of\\n', 'reconstruction.\\n', '\\n', '=The Supreme Court Refuses to Intervene.=--Numerous efforts were made to\\n', 'prevail upon the Supreme Court of the United States to declare such laws\\n', 'unconstitutional; but the Court, usually on technical grounds, avoided\\n', 'coming to a direct decision on the merits of the matter. In one case\\n', 'the Court remarked that it could not take charge of and operate the\\n', 'election machinery of Alabama; it concluded that \"relief from a great\\n', 'political wrong, if done as alleged, by the people of a state and by the\\n', 'state itself, must be given by them, or by the legislative and executive\\n', 'departments of the government of the United States.\" Only one of the\\n', 'several schemes employed, namely, the \"grandfather clause,\" was held to\\n', 'be a violation of the federal Constitution. This blow, effected in 1915\\n', 'by the decision in the Oklahoma and Maryland cases, left, however, the\\n', 'main structure of disfranchisement unimpaired.\\n', '\\n', '=Proposals to Reduce Southern Representation in Congress.=--These\\n', 'provisions excluding thousands of male citizens from the ballot did not,\\n', 'in express terms, deprive any one of the vote on account of race or\\n', 'color. They did not, therefore, run counter to the letter of the\\n', 'fifteenth amendment; but they did unquestionably make the states which\\n', 'adopted them liable to the operations of the fourteenth amendment. The\\n', 'latter very explicitly provides that whenever any state deprives adult\\n', 'male citizens of the right to vote (except in certain minor cases) the\\n', 'representation of the state in Congress shall be reduced in the\\n', 'proportion which such number of disfranchised citizens bears to the\\n', 'whole number of male citizens over twenty-one years of age.\\n', '\\n', 'Mindful of this provision, those who protested against disfranchisement\\n', 'in the South turned to the Republican party for relief, asking for\\n', 'action by the political branches of the federal government as the\\n', 'Supreme Court had suggested. The Republicans responded in their platform\\n', 'of 1908 by condemning all devices designed to deprive any one of the\\n', 'ballot for reasons of color alone; they demanded the enforcement in\\n', 'letter and spirit of the fourteenth as well as all other amendments.\\n', 'Though victorious in the election, the Republicans refrained from\\n', 'reopening the ancient contest; they made no attempt to reduce Southern\\n', 'representation in the House. Southern leaders, while protesting against\\n', 'the declarations of their opponents, were able to view them as idle\\n', 'threats in no way endangering the security of the measures by which\\n', 'political reconstruction had been undone.\\n', '\\n', '=The Solid South.=--Out of the thirty-year conflict against \"carpet-bag\\n', 'rule\" there emerged what was long known as the \"solid South\"--a South\\n', 'that, except occasionally in the border states, never gave an electoral\\n', 'vote to a Republican candidate for President. Before the Civil War, the\\n', 'Southern people had been divided on political questions. Take, for\\n', 'example, the election of 1860. In all the fifteen slave states the\\n', 'variety of opinion was marked. In nine of them--Delaware, Virginia,\\n', 'Tennessee, Missouri, Maryland, Louisiana, Kentucky, Georgia, and\\n', 'Arkansas--the combined vote against the representative of the extreme\\n', 'Southern point of view, Breckinridge, constituted a safe majority. In\\n', 'each of the six states which were carried by Breckinridge, there was a\\n', \"large and powerful minority. In North Carolina Breckinridge's majority\\n\", 'over Bell and Douglas was only 849 votes. Equally astounding to those\\n', 'who imagine the South united in defense of extreme views in 1860 was the\\n', 'vote for Bell, the Unionist candidate, who stood firmly for the\\n', \"Constitution and silence on slavery. In every Southern state Bell's vote\\n\", 'was large. In Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee it was greater\\n', 'than that received by Breckinridge; in Georgia, it was 42,000 against\\n', '51,000; in Louisiana, 20,000 against 22,000; in Mississippi, 25,000\\n', 'against 40,000.\\n', '\\n', 'The effect of the Civil War upon these divisions was immediate and\\n', 'decisive, save in the border states where thousands of men continued to\\n', 'adhere to the cause of Union. In the Confederacy itself nearly all\\n', 'dissent was silenced by war. Men who had been bitter opponents joined\\n', 'hands in defense of their homes; when the armed conflict was over they\\n', 'remained side by side working against \"Republican misrule and negro\\n', 'domination.\" By 1890, after Northern supremacy was definitely broken,\\n', 'they boasted that there were at least twelve Southern states in which no\\n', 'Republican candidate for President could win a single electoral vote.\\n', '\\n', '=Dissent in the Solid South.=--Though every one grew accustomed to speak\\n', 'of the South as \"solid,\" it did not escape close observers that in a\\n', 'number of Southern states there appeared from time to time a fairly\\n', 'large body of dissenters. In 1892 the Populists made heavy inroads upon\\n', 'the Democratic ranks. On other occasions, the contests between factions\\n', 'within the Democratic party over the nomination of candidates revealed\\n', 'sharp differences of opinion. In some places, moreover, there grew up a\\n', 'Republican minority of respectable size. For example, in Georgia, Mr.\\n', 'Taft in 1908 polled 41,000 votes against 72,000 for Mr. Bryan; in North\\n', 'Carolina, 114,000 against 136,000; in Tennessee, 118,000 against\\n', '135,000; in Kentucky, 235,000 against 244,000. In 1920, Senator Harding,\\n', 'the Republican candidate, broke the record by carrying Tennessee as well\\n', 'as Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Maryland.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE ECONOMIC ADVANCE OF THE SOUTH\\n', '\\n', '=The Break-up of the Great Estates.=--In the dissolution of chattel\\n', 'slavery it was inevitable that the great estate should give way before\\n', 'the small farm. The plantation was in fact founded on slavery. It was\\n', 'continued and expanded by slavery. Before the war the prosperous\\n', 'planter, either by inclination or necessity, invested his surplus in\\n', 'more land to add to his original domain. As his slaves increased in\\n', 'number, he was forced to increase his acreage or sell them, and he\\n', 'usually preferred the former, especially in the Far South. Still another\\n', 'element favored the large estate. Slave labor quickly exhausted the soil\\n', 'and of its own force compelled the cutting of the forests and the\\n', 'extension of the area under cultivation. Finally, the planter took a\\n', 'natural pride in his great estate; it was a sign of his prowess and his\\n', 'social prestige.\\n', '\\n', 'In 1865 the foundations of the planting system were gone. It was\\n', 'difficult to get efficient labor to till the vast plantations. The\\n', 'planters themselves were burdened with debts and handicapped by lack of\\n', 'capital. Negroes commonly preferred tilling plots of their own, rented\\n', 'or bought under mortgage, to the more irksome wage labor under white\\n', 'supervision. The land hunger of the white farmer, once checked by the\\n', 'planting system, reasserted itself. Before these forces the plantation\\n', 'broke up. The small farm became the unit of cultivation in the South as\\n', 'in the North. Between 1870 and 1900 the number of farms doubled in every\\n', 'state south of the line of the Potomac and Ohio rivers, except in\\n', 'Arkansas and Louisiana. From year to year the process of breaking up\\n', 'continued, with all that it implied in the creation of land-owning\\n', 'farmers.\\n', '\\n', '=The Diversification of Crops.=--No less significant was the concurrent\\n', 'diversification of crops. Under slavery, tobacco, rice, and sugar were\\n', 'staples and \"cotton was king.\" These were standard crops. The methods of\\n', 'cultivation were simple and easily learned. They tested neither the\\n', 'skill nor the ingenuity of the slaves. As the returns were quick, they\\n', 'did not call for long-time investments of capital. After slavery was\\n', 'abolished, they still remained the staples, but far-sighted\\n', 'agriculturists saw the dangers of depending upon a few crops. The mild\\n', 'climate all the way around the coast from Virginia to Texas and the\\n', 'character of the alluvial soil invited the exercise of more imagination.\\n', 'Peaches, oranges, peanuts, and other fruits and vegetables were found to\\n', 'grow luxuriantly. Refrigeration for steamships and freight cars put the\\n', 'markets of great cities at the doors of Southern fruit and vegetable\\n', 'gardeners. The South, which in planting days had relied so heavily upon\\n', 'the Northwest for its foodstuffs, began to battle for independence.\\n', 'Between 1880 and the close of the century the value of its farm crops\\n', 'increased from $660,000,000 to $1,270,000,000.\\n', '\\n', '=The Industrial and Commercial Revolution.=--On top of the radical\\n', 'changes in agriculture came an industrial and commercial revolution. The\\n', 'South had long been rich in natural resources, but the slave system had\\n', 'been unfavorable to their development. Rivers that would have turned\\n', 'millions of spindles tumbled unheeded to the seas. Coal and iron beds\\n', 'lay unopened. Timber was largely sacrificed in clearing lands for\\n', 'planting, or fell to earth in decay. Southern enterprise was consumed in\\n', 'planting. Slavery kept out the white immigrants who might have supplied\\n', 'the skilled labor for industry.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'STEEL MILLS--BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA]\\n', '\\n', 'After 1865, achievement and fortune no longer lay on the land alone. As\\n', 'soon as the paralysis of the war was over, the South caught the\\n', 'industrial spirit that had conquered feudal Europe and the agricultural\\n', 'North. In the development of mineral wealth, enormous strides were\\n', 'taken. Iron ore of every quality was found, the chief beds being in\\n', 'Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia,\\n', 'Alabama, Arkansas, and Texas. Five important coal basins were uncovered:\\n', 'in Virginia, North Carolina, the Appalachian chain from Maryland to\\n', 'Northern Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Texas. Oil pools were found\\n', 'in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas. Within two decades, 1880 to 1900, the\\n', 'output of mineral wealth multiplied tenfold: from ten millions a year to\\n', 'one hundred millions. The iron industries of West Virginia and Alabama\\n', 'began to rival those of Pennsylvania. Birmingham became the Pittsburgh\\n', 'and Atlanta the Chicago of the South.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'A SOUTHERN COTTON MILL IN A COTTON FIELD]\\n', '\\n', 'In other lines of industry, lumbering and cotton manufacturing took a\\n', 'high rank. The development of Southern timber resources was in every\\n', 'respect remarkable, particularly in Louisiana, Arkansas, and\\n', 'Mississippi. At the end of the first decade of the twentieth century,\\n', 'primacy in lumber had passed from the Great Lakes region to the South.\\n', 'In 1913 eight Southern states produced nearly four times as much lumber\\n', 'as the Lake states and twice as much as the vast forests of Washington\\n', 'and Oregon.\\n', '\\n', 'The development of the cotton industry, in the meantime, was similarly\\n', 'astounding. In 1865 cotton spinning was a negligible matter in the\\n', 'Southern states. In 1880 they had one-fourth of the mills of the\\n', 'country. At the end of the century they had one-half the mills, the two\\n', 'Carolinas taking the lead by consuming more than one-third of their\\n', 'entire cotton crop. Having both the raw materials and the power at hand,\\n', 'they enjoyed many advantages over the New England rivals, and at the\\n', 'opening of the new century were outstripping the latter in the\\n', 'proportion of spindles annually put into operation. Moreover, the cotton\\n', 'planters, finding a market at the neighboring mills, began to look\\n', 'forward to a day when they would be somewhat emancipated from absolute\\n', 'dependence upon the cotton exchanges of New York, New Orleans, and\\n', 'Liverpool.\\n', '\\n', 'Transportation kept pace with industry. In 1860, the South had about ten\\n', 'thousand miles of railway. By 1880 the figure had doubled. During the\\n', 'next twenty years over thirty thousand miles were added, most of the\\n', 'increase being in Texas. About 1898 there opened a period of\\n', 'consolidation in which scores of short lines were united, mainly under\\n', 'the leadership of Northern capitalists, and new through service opened\\n', 'to the North and West. Thus Southern industries were given easy outlets\\n', 'to the markets of the nation and brought within the main currents of\\n', 'national business enterprise.\\n', '\\n', '=The Social Effects of the Economic Changes.=--As long as the slave\\n', 'system lasted and planting was the major interest, the South was bound\\n', 'to be sectional in character. With slavery gone, crops diversified,\\n', 'natural resources developed, and industries promoted, the social order\\n', 'of the ante-bellum days inevitably dissolved; the South became more and\\n', 'more assimilated to the system of the North. In this process several\\n', 'lines of development are evident.\\n', '\\n', 'In the first place we see the steady rise of the small farmer. Even in\\n', 'the old days there had been a large class of white yeomen who owned no\\n', 'slaves and tilled the soil with their own hands, but they labored under\\n', 'severe handicaps. They found the fertile lands of the coast and river\\n', 'valleys nearly all monopolized by planters, and they were by the force\\n', 'of circumstances driven into the uplands where the soil was thin and the\\n', 'crops were light. Still they increased in numbers and zealously worked\\n', 'their freeholds.\\n', '\\n', 'The war proved to be their opportunity. With the break-up of the\\n', 'plantations, they managed to buy land more worthy of their plows. By\\n', 'intelligent labor and intensive cultivation they were able to restore\\n', 'much of the worn-out soil to its original fertility. In the meantime\\n', 'they rose with their prosperity in the social and political scale. It\\n', 'became common for the sons of white farmers to enter the professions,\\n', 'while their daughters went away to college and prepared for teaching.\\n', 'Thus a more democratic tone was given to the white society of the South.\\n', 'Moreover the migration to the North and West, which had formerly carried\\n', 'thousands of energetic sons and daughters to search for new homesteads,\\n', 'was materially reduced. The energy of the agricultural population went\\n', 'into rehabilitation.\\n', '\\n', 'The increase in the number of independent farmers was accompanied by the\\n', 'rise of small towns and villages which gave diversity to the life of the\\n', 'South. Before 1860 it was possible to travel through endless stretches\\n', \"of cotton and tobacco. The social affairs of the planter's family\\n\", 'centered in the homestead even if they were occasionally interrupted by\\n', 'trips to distant cities or abroad. Carpentry, bricklaying, and\\n', 'blacksmithing were usually done by slaves skilled in simple handicrafts.\\n', 'Supplies were bought wholesale. In this way there was little place in\\n', 'plantation economy for villages and towns with their stores and\\n', 'mechanics.\\n', '\\n', 'The abolition of slavery altered this. Small farms spread out where\\n', 'plantations had once stood. The skilled freedmen turned to agriculture\\n', 'rather than to handicrafts; white men of a business or mechanical bent\\n', 'found an opportunity to serve the needs of their communities. So local\\n', 'merchants and mechanics became an important element in the social\\n', 'system. In the county seats, once dominated by the planters, business\\n', 'and professional men assumed the leadership.\\n', '\\n', 'Another vital outcome of this revolution was the transference of a large\\n', 'part of planting enterprise to business. Mr. Bruce, a Southern historian\\n', 'of fine scholarship, has summed up this process in a single telling\\n', 'paragraph: \"The higher planting class that under the old system gave so\\n', 'much distinction to rural life has, so far as it has survived at all,\\n', 'been concentrated in the cities. The families that in the time of\\n', 'slavery would have been found only in the country are now found, with a\\n', 'few exceptions, in the towns. The transplantation has been practically\\n', 'universal. The talent, the energy, the ambition that formerly sought\\n', 'expression in the management of great estates and the control of hosts\\n', 'of slaves, now seek a field of action in trade, in manufacturing\\n', 'enterprises, or in the general enterprises of development. This was for\\n', 'the ruling class of the South the natural outcome of the great economic\\n', 'revolution that followed the war.\"\\n', '\\n', 'As in all other parts of the world, the mechanical revolution was\\n', 'attended by the growth of a population of industrial workers dependent\\n', 'not upon the soil but upon wages for their livelihood. When Jefferson\\n', 'Davis was inaugurated President of the Southern Confederacy, there were\\n', 'approximately only one hundred thousand persons employed in Southern\\n', 'manufactures as against more than a million in Northern mills. Fifty\\n', 'years later, Georgia and Alabama alone had more than one hundred and\\n', 'fifty thousand wage-earners. Necessarily this meant also a material\\n', 'increase in urban population, although the wide dispersion of cotton\\n', 'spinning among small centers prevented the congestion that had\\n', 'accompanied the rise of the textile industry in New England. In 1910,\\n', 'New Orleans, Atlanta, Memphis, Nashville, and Houston stood in the same\\n', 'relation to the New South that Cincinnati, Chicago, Cleveland, and\\n', 'Detroit had stood to the New West fifty years before. The problems of\\n', 'labor and capital and municipal administration, which the earlier\\n', 'writers boasted would never perplex the planting South, had come in full\\n', 'force.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'A GLIMPSE OF MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE]\\n', '\\n', '=The Revolution in the Status of the Slaves.=--No part of Southern\\n', 'society was so profoundly affected by the Civil War and economic\\n', 'reconstruction as the former slaves. On the day of emancipation, they\\n', 'stood free, but empty-handed, the owners of no tools or property, the\\n', 'masters of no trade and wholly inexperienced in the arts of self-help\\n', 'that characterized the whites in general. They had never been accustomed\\n', 'to looking out for themselves. The plantation bell had called them to\\n', 'labor and released them. Doles of food and clothing had been regularly\\n', 'made in given quantities. They did not understand wages, ownership,\\n', 'renting, contracts, mortgages, leases, bills, or accounts.\\n', '\\n', 'When they were emancipated, four courses were open to them. They could\\n', 'flee from the plantation to the nearest town or city, or to the distant\\n', 'North, to seek a livelihood. Thousands of them chose this way,\\n', 'overcrowding cities where disease mowed them down. They could remain\\n', 'where they, were in their cabins and work for daily wages instead of\\n', 'food, clothing, and shelter. This second course the major portion of\\n', 'them chose; but, as few masters had cash to dispense, the new relation\\n', 'was much like the old, in fact. It was still one of barter. The planter\\n', 'offered food, clothing, and shelter; the former slaves gave their labor\\n', 'in return. That was the best that many of them could do.\\n', '\\n', 'A third course open to freedmen was that of renting from the former\\n', 'master, paying him usually with a share of the produce of the land. This\\n', 'way a large number of them chose. It offered them a chance to become\\n', 'land owners in time and it afforded an easier life, the renter being, to\\n', 'a certain extent at least, master of his own hours of labor. The final\\n', 'and most difficult path was that to ownership of land. Many a master\\n', 'helped his former slaves to acquire small holdings by offering easy\\n', 'terms. The more enterprising and the more fortunate who started life as\\n', 'renters or wage-earners made their way upward to ownership in so many\\n', 'cases that by the end of the century, one-fourth of the colored laborers\\n', 'on the land owned the soil they tilled.\\n', '\\n', 'In the meantime, the South, though relatively poor, made relatively\\n', 'large expenditures for the education of the colored population. By the\\n', 'opening of the twentieth century, facilities were provided for more than\\n', 'one-half of the colored children of school age. While in many respects\\n', 'this progress was disappointing, its significance, to be appreciated,\\n', 'must be derived from a comparison with the total illiteracy which\\n', 'prevailed under slavery.\\n', '\\n', 'In spite of all that happened, however, the status of the negroes in the\\n', 'South continued to give a peculiar character to that section of the\\n', 'country. They were almost entirely excluded from the exercise of the\\n', 'suffrage, especially in the Far South. Special rooms were set aside for\\n', 'them at the railway stations and special cars on the railway lines. In\\n', 'the field of industry calling for technical skill, it appears, from the\\n', 'census figures, that they lost ground between 1890 and 1900--a condition\\n', 'which their friends ascribed to discriminations against them in law and\\n', 'in labor organizations and their critics ascribed to their lack of\\n', 'aptitude. Whatever may be the truth, the fact remained that at the\\n', 'opening of the twentieth century neither the hopes of the emancipators\\n', 'nor the fears of their opponents were realized. The marks of the\\n', '\"peculiar institution\" were still largely impressed upon Southern\\n', 'society.\\n', '\\n', 'The situation, however, was by no means unchanging. On the contrary\\n', 'there was a decided drift in affairs. For one thing, the proportion of\\n', 'negroes in the South had slowly declined. By 1900 they were in a\\n', 'majority in only two states, South Carolina and Mississippi. In\\n', 'Arkansas, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina the proportion of\\n', 'the white population was steadily growing. The colored migration\\n', 'northward increased while the westward movement of white farmers which\\n', 'characterized pioneer days declined. At the same time a part of the\\n', 'foreign immigration into the United States was diverted southward. As\\n', 'the years passed these tendencies gained momentum. The already huge\\n', 'colored quarters in some Northern cities were widely expanded, as whole\\n', 'counties in the South were stripped of their colored laborers. The race\\n', 'question, in its political and economic aspects, became less and less\\n', 'sectional, more and more national. The South was drawn into the main\\n', 'stream of national life. The separatist forces which produced the\\n', 'cataclysm of 1861 sank irresistibly into the background.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', 'H.W.

Against the slow and leisurely stagecoach,\\n', 'they set the swift express, rushing from New York to San Francisco in\\n', 'less time than Washington consumed in his triumphal tour from Mt.

Figures\\n', 'and contrasts cannot, however, tell the whole story. Take, for example,\\n', 'the extension of railways. It is easy to relate that there were 30,000\\n', 'miles in 1860; 166,000 in 1890; and 242,000 in 1910. It is easy to show\\n', 'upon the map how a few straggling lines became a perfect mesh of closely\\n', 'knitted railways; or how, like the tentacles of a great monster, the few\\n', 'roads ending in the Mississippi Valley in 1860 were extended and\\n', 'multiplied until they tapped every wheat field, mine, and forest beyond\\n', 'the valley. All this, eloquent of enterprise as it truly is, does not\\n', 'reveal the significance of railways for American life. It does not\\n', 'indicate how railways made a continental market for American goods; nor\\n', 'how they standardized the whole country, giving to cities on the\\n', 'advancing frontier the leading features of cities in the old East; nor\\n', 'how they carried to the pioneer the comforts of civilization; nor yet\\n', 'how in the West they were the forerunners of civilization, the makers of\\n', 'homesteads, the builders of states.\\n', '\\n', '=Government Aid for Railways.=--Still the story is not ended. The\\n', 'significant relation between railways and politics must not be\\n', 'overlooked. The bounty of a lavish government, for example, made\\n', 'possible the work of railway promoters. By the year 1872 the Federal\\n', 'government had granted in aid of railways 155,000,000 acres of land--an\\n', 'area estimated as almost equal to Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut,\\n', 'Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The\\n', 'Union Pacific Company alone secured from the federal government a free\\n', 'right of way through the public domain, twenty sections of land with\\n', 'each mile of railway, and a loan up to fifty millions of dollars secured\\n', \"by a second mortgage on the company's property. More than half of the\\n\", 'northern tier of states lying against Canada from Lake Michigan to the\\n', 'Pacific was granted to private companies in aid of railways and wagon\\n', 'roads. About half of New Mexico, Arizona, and California was also given\\n', 'outright to railway companies. These vast grants from the federal\\n', 'government were supplemented by gifts from the states in land and by\\n', 'subscriptions amounting to more than two hundred million dollars. The\\n', 'history of these gifts and their relation to the political leaders that\\n', 'engineered them would alone fill a large and interesting volume.\\n', '\\n', '=Railway Fortunes and Capital.=--Out of this gigantic railway promotion,\\n', 'the first really immense American fortunes were made. Henry Adams, the\\n', 'grandson of John Quincy Adams, related that his grandfather on his\\n', \"mother's side, Peter Brooks, on his death in 1849, left a fortune of two\\n\", 'million dollars, \"supposed to be the largest estate in Boston,\" then one\\n', 'of the few centers of great riches. Compared with the opulence that\\n', 'sprang out of the Union Pacific, the Northern Pacific, the Southern\\n', 'Pacific, with their subsidiary and component lines, the estate of Peter\\n', \"Brooks was a poor man's heritage.\\n\", '\\n', 'The capital invested in these railways was enormous beyond the\\n', 'imagination of the men of the stagecoach generation. The total debt of\\n', 'the United States incurred in the Revolutionary War--a debt which those\\n', 'of little faith thought the country could never pay--was reckoned at a\\n', 'figure well under $75,000,000. When the Union Pacific Railroad was\\n', 'completed, there were outstanding against it $27,000,000 in first\\n', 'mortgage bonds, $27,000,000 in second mortgage bonds held by the\\n', 'government, $10,000,000 in income bonds, $10,000,000 in land grant\\n', 'bonds, and, on top of that huge bonded indebtedness, $36,000,000 in\\n', 'stock--making $110,000,000 in all. If the amount due the United States\\n', 'government be subtracted, still there remained, in private hands, stocks\\n', \"and bonds exceeding in value the whole national debt of Hamilton's\\n\", 'day--a debt that strained all the resources of the Federal government in\\n', '1790. Such was the financial significance of the railways.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: RAILROADS OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1918]\\n', '\\n', '=Growth and Extension of Industry.=--In the field of manufacturing,\\n', 'mining, and metal working, the results of business enterprise far\\n', 'outstripped, if measured in mere dollars, the results of railway\\n', 'construction. By the end of the century there were about ten billion\\n', 'dollars invested in factories alone and five million wage-earners\\n', 'employed in them; while the total value of the output, fourteen billion\\n', 'dollars, was fifteen times the figure for 1860. In the Eastern states\\n', 'industries multiplied. In the Northwest territory, the old home of\\n', 'Jacksonian Democracy, they overtopped agriculture. By the end of the\\n', 'century, Ohio had almost reached and Illinois had surpassed\\n', 'Massachusetts in the annual value of manufacturing output.\\n', '\\n', 'That was not all. Untold wealth in the form of natural resources was\\n', 'discovered in the South and West. Coal deposits were found in the\\n', 'Appalachians stretching from Pennsylvania down to Alabama, in Michigan,\\n', 'in the Mississippi Valley, and in the Western mountains from North\\n', 'Dakota to New Mexico. In nearly every coal-bearing region, iron was also\\n', 'discovered and the great fields of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota\\n', 'soon rivaled those of the Appalachian area. Copper, lead, gold, and\\n', 'silver in fabulous quantities were unearthed by the restless prospectors\\n', 'who left no plain or mountain fastness unexplored. Petroleum, first\\n', 'pumped from the wells of Pennsylvania in the summer of 1859, made new\\n', 'fortunes equaling those of trade, railways, and land speculation. It\\n', 'scattered its riches with an especially lavish hand through Oklahoma,\\n', 'Texas, and California.\\n', '\\n', '=The Trust--an Instrument of Industrial Progress.=--Business enterprise,\\n', 'under the direction of powerful men working single-handed, or of small\\n', 'groups of men pooling their capital for one or more undertakings, had\\n', 'not advanced far before there appeared upon the scene still mightier\\n', 'leaders of even greater imagination. New constructive genius now brought\\n', 'together and combined under one management hundreds of concerns or\\n', 'thousands of miles of railways, revealing the magic strength of\\n', 'cooperation on a national scale. Price-cutting in oil, threatening ruin\\n', 'to those engaged in the industry, as early as 1879, led a number of\\n', 'companies in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia to unite in\\n', 'price-fixing. Three years later a group of oil interests formed a close\\n', 'organization, placing all their stocks in the hands of trustees, among\\n', 'whom was John D. Rockefeller. The trustees, in turn, issued\\n', 'certificates representing the share to which each participant was\\n', 'entitled; and took over the management of the entire business. Such was\\n', 'the nature of the \"trust,\" which was to play such an unique role in the\\n', 'progress of America.\\n', '\\n', 'The idea of combination was applied in time to iron and steel, copper,\\n', 'lead, sugar, cordage, coal, and other commodities, until in each field\\n', 'there loomed a giant trust or corporation, controlling, if not most of\\n', 'the output, at least enough to determine in a large measure the prices\\n', 'charged to consumers. With the passing years, the railways, mills,\\n', 'mines, and other business concerns were transferred from individual\\n', 'owners to corporations. At the end of the nineteenth century, the whole\\n', 'face of American business was changed. Three-fourths of the output from\\n', 'industries came from factories under corporate management and only\\n', 'one-fourth from individual and partnership undertakings.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER]\\n', '\\n', '=The Banking Corporation.=--Very closely related to the growth of\\n', 'business enterprise on a large scale was the system of banking. In the\\n', 'old days before banks, a person with savings either employed them in his\\n', 'own undertakings, lent them to a neighbor, or hid them away where they\\n', 'set no industry in motion. Even in the early stages of modern business,\\n', 'it was common for a manufacturer to rise from small beginnings by\\n', 'financing extensions out of his own earnings and profits. This state of\\n', 'affairs was profoundly altered by the growth of the huge corporations\\n', 'requiring millions and even billions of capital. The banks, once an\\n', 'adjunct to business, became the leaders in business.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'WALL STREET, NEW YORK CITY]\\n', '\\n', 'It was the banks that undertook to sell the stocks and bonds issued by\\n', 'new corporations and trusts and to supply them with credit to carry on\\n', 'their operations. Indeed, many of the great mergers or combinations in\\n', 'business were initiated by magnates in the banking world with millions\\n', 'and billions under their control. Through their connections with one\\n', 'another, the banks formed a perfect network of agencies gathering up the\\n', 'pennies and dollars of the masses as well as the thousands of the rich\\n', 'and pouring them all into the channels of business and manufacturing.\\n', 'In this growth of banking on a national scale, it was inevitable that a\\n', 'few great centers, like Wall Street in New York or State Street in\\n', 'Boston, should rise to a position of dominance both in concentrating the\\n', 'savings and profits of the nation and in financing new as well as old\\n', 'corporations.\\n', '\\n', '=The Significance of the Corporation.=--The corporation, in fact, became\\n', 'the striking feature of American business life, one of the most\\n', 'marvelous institutions of all time, comparable in wealth and power and\\n', 'the number of its servants with kingdoms and states of old. The effect\\n', 'of its rise and growth cannot be summarily estimated; but some special\\n', 'facts are obvious. It made possible gigantic enterprises once entirely\\n', 'beyond the reach of any individual, no matter how rich. It eliminated\\n', 'many of the futile and costly wastes of competition in connection with\\n', 'manufacture, advertising, and selling. It studied the cheapest methods\\n', 'of production and shut down mills that were poorly equipped or\\n', 'disadvantageously located. It established laboratories for research in\\n', 'industry, chemistry, and mechanical inventions. Through the sale of\\n', 'stocks and bonds, it enabled tens of thousands of people to become\\n', 'capitalists, if only in a small way. The corporation made it possible\\n', 'for one person to own, for instance, a $50 share in a million dollar\\n', 'business concern--a thing entirely impossible under a regime of\\n', 'individual owners and partnerships.\\n', '\\n', 'There was, of course, another side to the picture. Many of the\\n', 'corporations sought to become monopolies and to make profits, not by\\n', 'economies and good management, but by extortion from purchasers.\\n', 'Sometimes they mercilessly crushed small business men, their\\n', 'competitors, bribed members of legislatures to secure favorable laws,\\n', 'and contributed to the campaign funds of both leading parties. Wherever\\n', 'a trust approached the position of a monopoly, it acquired a dominion\\n', 'over the labor market which enabled it to break even the strongest trade\\n', 'unions. In short, the power of the trust in finance, in manufacturing,\\n', 'in politics, and in the field of labor control can hardly be measured.\\n', '\\n', '=The Corporation and Labor.=--In the development of the corporation\\n', 'there was to be observed a distinct severing of the old ties between\\n', 'master and workmen, which existed in the days of small industries. For\\n', 'the personal bond between the owner and the employees was substituted a\\n', 'new relation. \"In most parts of our country,\" as President Wilson once\\n', 'said, \"men work, not for themselves, not as partners in the old way in\\n', 'which they used to work, but generally as employees--in a higher or\\n', 'lower grade--of great corporations.\" The owner disappeared from the\\n', 'factory and in his place came the manager, representing the usually\\n', 'invisible stockholders and dependent for his success upon his ability to\\n', 'make profits for the owners. Hence the term \"soulless corporation,\"\\n', 'which was to exert such a deep influence on American thinking about\\n', 'industrial relations.\\n', '\\n', '=Cities and Immigration.=--Expressed in terms of human life, this era of\\n', 'unprecedented enterprise meant huge industrial cities and an immense\\n', 'labor supply, derived mainly from European immigration. Here, too,\\n', \"figures tell only a part of the story. In Washington's day nine-tenths\\n\", 'of the American people were engaged in agriculture and lived in the\\n', 'country; in 1890 more than one-third of the population dwelt in towns of\\n', '2500 and over; in 1920 more than half of the population lived in towns\\n', 'of over 2500. In forty years, between 1860 and 1900, Greater New York\\n', 'had grown from 1,174,000 to 3,437,000; San Francisco from 56,000 to\\n', '342,000; Chicago from 109,000 to 1,698,000. The miles of city tenements\\n', 'began to rival, in the number of their residents, the farm homesteads of\\n', 'the West. The time so dreaded by Jefferson had arrived. People were\\n', '\"piled upon one another in great cities\" and the republic of small\\n', 'farmers had passed away.\\n', '\\n', 'To these industrial centers flowed annually an ever-increasing tide of\\n', 'immigration, reaching the half million point in 1880; rising to\\n', 'three-quarters of a million three years later; and passing the million\\n', 'mark in a single year at the opening of the new century. Immigration was\\n', 'as old as America but new elements now entered the situation. In the\\n', 'first place, there were radical changes in the nationality of the\\n', 'newcomers. The migration from Northern Europe--England, Ireland,\\n', 'Germany, and Scandinavia--diminished; that from Italy, Russia, and\\n', 'Austria-Hungary increased, more than three-fourths of the entire number\\n', 'coming from these three lands between the years 1900 and 1910. These\\n', 'later immigrants were Italians, Poles, Magyars, Czechs, Slovaks,\\n', 'Russians, and Jews, who came from countries far removed from the\\n', 'language and the traditions of England whence came the founders of\\n', 'America.\\n', '\\n', 'In the second place, the reception accorded the newcomers differed from\\n', 'that given to the immigrants in the early days. By 1890 all the free\\n', 'land was gone. They could not, therefore, be dispersed widely among the\\n', 'native Americans to assimilate quickly and unconsciously the habits and\\n', 'ideas of American life. On the contrary, they were diverted mainly to\\n', 'the industrial centers. There they crowded--nay, overcrowded--into\\n', 'colonies of their own where they preserved their languages, their\\n', 'newspapers, and their old-world customs and views.\\n', '\\n', 'So eager were American business men to get an enormous labor supply that\\n', 'they asked few questions about the effect of this \"alien invasion\" upon\\n', 'the old America inherited from the fathers. They even stimulated the\\n', 'invasion artificially by importing huge armies of foreigners under\\n', 'contract to work in specified mines and mills. There seemed to be no\\n', 'limit to the factories, forges, refineries, and railways that could be\\n', 'built, to the multitudes that could be employed in conquering a\\n', 'continent. As for the future, that was in the hands of Providence!\\n', '\\n', \"=Business Theories of Politics.=--As the statesmen of Hamilton's school\\n\", \"and the planters of Calhoun's had their theories of government and\\n\", 'politics, so the leaders in business enterprise had theirs. It was\\n', 'simple and easily stated. \"It is the duty of the government,\" they\\n', 'urged, \"to protect American industry against foreign competition by\\n', 'means of high tariffs on imported goods, to aid railways by generous\\n', 'grants of land, to sell mineral and timber lands at low prices to\\n', 'energetic men ready to develop them, and then to leave the rest to the\\n', 'initiative and drive of individuals and companies.\" All government\\n', 'interference with the management, prices, rates, charges, and conduct of\\n', 'private business they held to be either wholly pernicious or intolerably\\n', 'impertinent. Judging from their speeches and writings, they conceived\\n', 'the nation as a great collection of individuals, companies, and labor\\n', 'unions all struggling for profits or high wages and held together by a\\n', 'government whose principal duty was to keep the peace among them and\\n', 'protect industry against the foreign manufacturer. Such was the\\n', 'political theory of business during the generation that followed the\\n', 'Civil War.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE SUPREMACY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY (1861-85)\\n', '\\n', '=Business Men and Republican Policies.=--Most of the leaders in industry\\n', 'gravitated to the Republican ranks. They worked in the North and the\\n', 'Republican party was essentially Northern. It was moreover--at least so\\n', 'far as the majority of its members were concerned--committed to\\n', 'protective tariffs, a sound monetary and banking system, the promotion\\n', 'of railways and industry by land grants, and the development of internal\\n', 'improvements. It was furthermore generous in its immigration policy. It\\n', 'proclaimed America to be an asylum for the oppressed of all countries\\n', 'and flung wide the doors for immigrants eager to fill the factories, man\\n', 'the mines, and settle upon Western lands. In a word the Republicans\\n', 'stood for all those specific measures which favored the enlargement and\\n', 'prosperity of business. At the same time they resisted government\\n', 'interference with private enterprise. They did not regulate railway\\n', 'rates, prosecute trusts for forming combinations, or prevent railway\\n', 'companies from giving lower rates to some shippers than to others. To\\n', 'sum it up, the political theories of the Republican party for three\\n', 'decades after the Civil War were the theories of American\\n', 'business--prosperous and profitable industries for the owners and \"the\\n', 'full dinner pail\" for the workmen. Naturally a large portion of those\\n', 'who flourished under its policies gave their support to it, voted for\\n', 'its candidates, and subscribed to its campaign funds.\\n', '\\n', '=Sources of Republican Strength in the North.=--The Republican party was\\n', 'in fact a political organization of singular power. It originated in a\\n', 'wave of moral enthusiasm, having attracted to itself, if not the\\n', 'abolitionists, certainly all those idealists, like James Russell Lowell\\n', 'and George William Curtis, who had opposed slavery when opposition was\\n', 'neither safe nor popular. To moral principles it added practical\\n', 'considerations. Business men had confidence in it. Workingmen, who\\n', 'longed for the independence of the farmer, owed to its indulgent land\\n', 'policy the opportunity of securing free homesteads in the West. The\\n', 'immigrant, landing penniless on these shores, as a result of the same\\n', 'beneficent system, often found himself in a little while with an estate\\n', 'as large as many a baronial domain in the Old World. Under a Republican\\n', 'administration, the union had been saved. To it the veterans of the war\\n', 'could turn with confidence for those rewards of service which the\\n', 'government could bestow: pensions surpassing in liberality anything that\\n', 'the world had ever seen. Under a Republican administration also the\\n', 'great debt had been created in the defense of the union, and to the\\n', 'Republican party every investor in government bonds could look for the\\n', 'full and honorable discharge of the interest and principal. The spoils\\n', 'system, inaugurated by Jacksonian Democracy, in turn placed all the\\n', 'federal offices in Republican hands, furnishing an army of party workers\\n', 'to be counted on for loyal service in every campaign.\\n', '\\n', 'Of all these things Republican leaders made full and vigorous use,\\n', 'sometimes ascribing to the party, in accordance with ancient political\\n', 'usage, merits and achievements not wholly its own. Particularly was this\\n', 'true in the case of saving the union. \"When in the economy of\\n', 'Providence, this land was to be purged of human slavery ... the\\n', 'Republican party came into power,\" ran a declaration in one platform.\\n', '\"The Republican party suppressed a gigantic rebellion, emancipated four\\n', 'million slaves, decreed the equal citizenship of all, and established\\n', 'universal suffrage,\" ran another. As for the aid rendered by the\\n', 'millions of Northern Democrats who stood by the union and the tens of\\n', 'thousands of them who actually fought in the union army, the Republicans\\n', 'in their zeal were inclined to be oblivious. They repeatedly charged the\\n', 'Democratic party \"with being the same in character and spirit as when it\\n', 'sympathized with treason.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Republican Control of the South.=--To the strength enjoyed in the\\n', 'North, the Republicans for a long time added the advantages that came\\n', 'from control over the former Confederate states where the newly\\n', 'enfranchised negroes, under white leadership, gave a grateful support to\\n', 'the party responsible for their freedom. In this branch of politics,\\n', 'motives were so mixed that no historian can hope to appraise them all at\\n', 'their proper values. On the one side of the ledger must be set the\\n', 'vigorous efforts of the honest and sincere friends of the freedmen to\\n', 'win for them complete civil and political equality, wiping out not only\\n', 'slavery but all its badges of misery and servitude. On the same side\\n', 'must be placed the labor of those who had valiantly fought in forum and\\n', 'field to save the union and who regarded continued Republican supremacy\\n', 'after the war as absolutely necessary to prevent the former leaders in\\n', 'secession from coming back to power. At the same time there were\\n', 'undoubtedly some men of the baser sort who looked on politics as a game\\n', 'and who made use of \"carpet-bagging\" in the South to win the spoils that\\n', 'might result from it. At all events, both by laws and presidential acts,\\n', 'the Republicans for many years kept a keen eye upon the maintenance of\\n', 'their dominion in the South. Their declaration that neither the law nor\\n', 'its administration should admit any discrimination in respect of\\n', 'citizens by reason of race, color, or previous condition of servitude\\n', 'appealed to idealists and brought results in elections. Even South\\n', 'Carolina, where reposed the ashes of John C. Calhoun, went Republican in\\n', '1872 by a vote of three to one!\\n', '\\n', 'Republican control was made easy by the force bills described in a\\n', 'previous chapter--measures which vested the supervision of elections in\\n', 'federal officers appointed by Republican Presidents. These drastic\\n', 'measures, departing from American tradition, the Republican authors\\n', 'urged, were necessary to safeguard the purity of the ballot, not merely\\n', 'in the South where the timid freedman might readily be frightened from\\n', 'using it; but also in the North, particularly in New York City, where it\\n', 'was claimed that fraud was regularly practiced by Democratic leaders.\\n', '\\n', 'The Democrats, on their side, indignantly denied the charges, replying\\n', 'that the force bills were nothing but devices created by the Republicans\\n', 'for the purpose of securing their continued rule through systematic\\n', 'interference with elections. Even the measures of reconstruction were\\n', 'deemed by Democratic leaders as thinly veiled schemes to establish\\n', 'Republican power throughout the country. \"Nor is there the slightest\\n', 'doubt,\" exclaimed Samuel J. Tilden, spokesman of the Democrats in New\\n', 'York and candidate for President in 1876, \"that the paramount object and\\n', 'motive of the Republican party is by these means to secure itself\\n', 'against a reaction of opinion adverse to it in our great populous\\n', 'Northern commonwealths.... When the Republican party resolved to\\n', 'establish negro supremacy in the ten states in order to gain to itself\\n', 'the representation of those states in Congress, it had to begin by\\n', 'governing the people of those states by the sword.... The next was the\\n', 'creation of new electoral bodies for those ten states, in which, by\\n', 'exclusions, by disfranchisements and proscriptions, by control over\\n', 'registration, by applying test oaths ... by intimidation and by every\\n', 'form of influence, three million negroes are made to predominate over\\n', 'four and a half million whites.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The War as a Campaign Issue.=--Even the repeal of force bills could not\\n', 'allay the sectional feelings engendered by the war. The Republicans\\n', 'could not forgive the men who had so recently been in arms against the\\n', 'union and insisted on calling them \"traitors\" and \"rebels.\" The\\n', 'Southerners, smarting under the reconstruction acts, could regard the\\n', 'Republicans only as political oppressors. The passions of the war had\\n', 'been too strong; the distress too deep to be soon forgotten. The\\n', 'generation that went through it all remembered it all. For twenty\\n', 'years, the Republicans, in their speeches and platforms, made \"a\\n', 'straight appeal to the patriotism of the Northern voters.\" They\\n', 'maintained that their party, which had saved the union and emancipated\\n', 'the slaves, was alone worthy of protecting the union and uplifting the\\n', 'freedmen.\\n', '\\n', 'Though the Democrats, especially in the North, resented this policy and\\n', 'dubbed it with the expressive but inelegant phrase, \"waving the bloody\\n', 'shirt,\" the Republicans refused to surrender a slogan which made such a\\n', 'ready popular appeal. As late as 1884, a leader expressed the hope that\\n', 'they might \"wring one more President from the bloody shirt.\" They\\n', 'refused to let the country forget that the Democratic candidate, Grover\\n', 'Cleveland, had escaped military service by hiring a substitute; and they\\n', 'made political capital out of the fact that he had \"insulted the\\n', 'veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic\" by going fishing on\\n', 'Decoration Day.\\n', '\\n', '=Three Republican Presidents.=--Fortified by all these elements of\\n', 'strength, the Republicans held the presidency from 1869 to 1885. The\\n', 'three Presidents elected in this period, Grant, Hayes, and Garfield, had\\n', 'certain striking characteristics in common. They were all of origin\\n', 'humble enough to please the most exacting Jacksonian Democrat. They had\\n', 'been generals in the union army. Grant, next to Lincoln, was regarded as\\n', 'the savior of the Constitution. Hayes and Garfield, though lesser lights\\n', 'in the military firmament, had honorable records duly appreciated by\\n', 'veterans of the war, now thoroughly organized into the Grand Army of the\\n', 'Republic. It is true that Grant was not a politician and had never voted\\n', 'the Republican ticket; but this was readily overlooked. Hayes and\\n', 'Garfield on the other hand were loyal party men. The former had served\\n', 'in Congress and for three terms as governor of his state. The latter had\\n', 'long been a member of the House of Representatives and was Senator-elect\\n', 'when he received the nomination for President.\\n', '\\n', 'All of them possessed, moreover, another important asset, which was not\\n', 'forgotten by the astute managers who led in selecting candidates. All\\n', 'of them were from Ohio--though Grant had been in Illinois when the\\n', 'summons to military duties came--and Ohio was a strategic state. It lay\\n', 'between the manufacturing East and the agrarian country to the West.\\n', 'Having growing industries and wool to sell it benefited from the\\n', 'protective tariff. Yet being mainly agricultural still, it was not\\n', '\\n', 'without sympathy for the farmers who showed low tariff or free trade\\n', 'tendencies. Whatever share the East had in shaping laws and framing\\n', 'policies, it was clear that the West was to have the candidates. This\\n', 'division in privileges--not uncommon in political management--was always\\n', 'accompanied by a judicious selection of the candidate for Vice\\n', 'President. With Garfield, for example, was associated a prominent New\\n', 'York politician, Chester A. Arthur, who, as fate decreed, was destined\\n', \"to more than three years' service as chief magistrate, on the\\n\", 'assassination of his superior in office.\\n', '\\n', '=The Disputed Election of 1876.=--While taking note of the long years of\\n', 'Republican supremacy, it must be recorded that grave doubts exist in the\\n', 'minds of many historians as to whether one of the three Presidents,\\n', 'Hayes, was actually the victor in 1876 or not. His Democratic opponent,\\n', 'Samuel J. Tilden, received a popular plurality of a quarter of a million\\n', 'and had a plausible claim to a majority of the electoral vote. At all\\n', 'events, four states sent in double returns, one set for Tilden and\\n', 'another for Hayes; and a deadlock ensued. Both parties vehemently\\n', 'claimed the election and the passions ran so high that sober men did not\\n', 'shrink from speaking of civil war again. Fortunately, in the end, the\\n', 'counsels of peace prevailed. Congress provided for an electoral\\n', 'commission of fifteen men to review the contested returns. The\\n', \"Democrats, inspired by Tilden's moderation, accepted the judgment in\\n\", 'favor of Hayes even though they were not convinced that he was really\\n', 'entitled to the office.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE GROWTH OF OPPOSITION TO REPUBLICAN RULE\\n', '\\n', '=Abuses in American Political Life.=--During their long tenure of\\n', 'office, the Republicans could not escape the inevitable consequences of\\n', 'power; that is, evil practices and corrupt conduct on the part of some\\n', 'who found shelter within the party. For that matter neither did the\\n', 'Democrats manage to avoid such difficulties in those states and cities\\n', 'where they had the majority. In New York City, for instance, the local\\n', 'Democratic organization, known as Tammany Hall, passed under the sway of\\n', 'a group of politicians headed by \"Boss\" Tweed. He plundered the city\\n', 'treasury until public-spirited citizens, supported by Samuel J. Tilden,\\n', 'the Democratic leader of the state, rose in revolt, drove the ringleader\\n', 'from power, and sent him to jail. In Philadelphia, the local Republican\\n', 'bosses were guilty of offenses as odious as those committed by New York\\n', 'politicians. Indeed, the decade that followed the Civil War was marred\\n', 'by so many scandals in public life that one acute editor was moved to\\n', 'inquire: \"Are not all the great communities of the Western World growing\\n', 'more corrupt as they grow in wealth?\"\\n', '\\n', 'In the sphere of national politics, where the opportunities were\\n', 'greater, betrayals of public trust were even more flagrant. One\\n', 'revelation after another showed officers, high and low, possessed with\\n', 'the spirit of peculation. Members of Congress, it was found, accepted\\n', 'railway stock in exchange for votes in favor of land grants and other\\n', 'concessions to the companies. In the administration as well as the\\n', 'legislature the disease was rife. Revenue officers permitted whisky\\n', 'distillers to evade their taxes and received heavy bribes in return. A\\n', 'probe into the post-office department revealed the malodorous \"star\\n', 'route frauds\"--the deliberate overpayment of certain mail carriers whose\\n', 'lines were indicated in the official record by asterisks or stars. Even\\n', 'cabinet officers did not escape suspicion, for the trail of the serpent\\n', 'led straight to the door of one of them.\\n', '\\n', 'In the lower ranges of official life, the spoils system became more\\n', 'virulent as the number of federal employees increased. The holders of\\n', 'offices and the seekers after them constituted a veritable political\\n', 'army. They crowded into Republican councils, for the Republicans, being\\n', 'in power, could alone dispense federal favors. They filled positions in\\n', 'the party ranging from the lowest township committee to the national\\n', 'convention. They helped to nominate candidates and draft platforms and\\n', 'elbowed to one side the busy citizen, not conversant with party\\n', 'intrigues, who could only give an occasional day to political matters.\\n', 'Even the Civil Service Act of 1883, wrung from a reluctant Congress two\\n', 'years after the assassination of Garfield, made little change for a long\\n', 'time. It took away from the spoilsmen a few thousand government\\n', 'positions, but it formed no check on the practice of rewarding party\\n', 'workers from the public treasury.\\n', '\\n', 'On viewing this state of affairs, many a distinguished citizen became\\n', 'profoundly discouraged. James Russell Lowell, for example, thought he\\n', \"saw a steady decline in public morals. In 1865, hearing of Lee's\\n\", 'surrender, he had exclaimed: \"There is something magnificent in having a\\n', 'country to love!\" Ten years later, when asked to write an ode for the\\n', 'centennial at Philadelphia in 1876, he could think only of a biting\\n', 'satire on the nation:\\n', '\\n', '    \"Show your state legislatures; show your Rings;\\n', '     And challenge Europe to produce such things\\n', '     As high officials sitting half in sight\\n', '     To share the plunder and fix things right.\\n', \"     If that don't fetch her, why, you need only\\n\", '     To show your latest style in martyrs,--Tweed:\\n', \"     She'll find it hard to hide her spiteful tears\\n\", '     At such advance in one poor hundred years.\"\\n', '\\n', 'When his critics condemned him for this \"attack upon his native land,\"\\n', 'Lowell replied in sadness: \"These fellows have no notion of what love of\\n', 'country means. It was in my very blood and bones. If I am not an\\n', 'American who ever was?... What fills me with doubt and dismay is the\\n', 'degradation of the moral tone. Is it or is it not a result of democracy?\\n', \"Is ours a 'government of the people, by the people, for the people,' or\\n\", 'a Kakistocracy [a government of the worst], rather for the benefit of\\n', 'knaves at the cost of fools?\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Reform Movement in Republican Ranks.=--The sentiments expressed by\\n', 'Lowell, himself a Republican and for a time American ambassador to\\n', 'England, were shared by many men in his party. Very soon after the close\\n', 'of the Civil War some of them began to protest vigorously against the\\n', 'policies and conduct of their leaders. In 1872, the dissenters, calling\\n', 'themselves Liberal Republicans, broke away altogether, nominated a\\n', 'candidate of their own, Horace Greeley, and put forward a platform\\n', 'indicting the Republican President fiercely enough to please the most\\n', 'uncompromising Democrat. They accused Grant of using \"the powers and\\n', 'opportunities of his high office for the promotion of personal ends.\"\\n', 'They charged him with retaining \"notoriously corrupt and unworthy men in\\n', 'places of power and responsibility.\" They alleged that the Republican\\n', 'party kept \"alive the passions and resentments of the late civil war to\\n', 'use them for their own advantages,\" and employed the \"public service of\\n', 'the government as a machinery of corruption and personal influence.\"\\n', '\\n', 'It was not apparent, however, from the ensuing election that any\\n', 'considerable number of Republicans accepted the views of the Liberals.\\n', 'Greeley, though indorsed by the Democrats, was utterly routed and died\\n', 'of a broken heart. The lesson of his discomfiture seemed to be that\\n', 'independent action was futile. So, at least, it was regarded by most men\\n', 'of the rising generation like Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts, and\\n', 'Theodore Roosevelt, of New York. Profiting by the experience of Greeley\\n', 'they insisted in season and out that reformers who desired to rid the\\n', 'party of abuses should remain loyal to it and do their work \"on the\\n', 'inside.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Mugwumps and Cleveland Democracy in 1884.=--Though aided by\\n', 'Republican dissensions, the Democrats were slow in making headway\\n', 'against the political current. They were deprived of the energetic and\\n', 'capable leadership once afforded by the planters, like Calhoun, Davis,\\n', 'and Toombs; they were saddled by their opponents with responsibility for\\n', 'secession; and they were stripped of the support of the prostrate\\n', 'South. Not until the last Southern state was restored to the union, not\\n', 'until a general amnesty was wrung from Congress, not until white\\n', 'supremacy was established at the polls, and the last federal soldier\\n', 'withdrawn from Southern capitals did they succeed in capturing the\\n', 'presidency.\\n', '\\n', 'The opportune moment for them came in 1884 when a number of\\n', 'circumstances favored their aspirations. The Republicans, leaving the\\n', 'Ohio Valley in their search for a candidate, nominated James G. Blaine\\n', 'of Maine, a vigorous and popular leader but a man under fire from the\\n', 'reformers in his own party. The Democrats on their side were able to\\n', 'find at this juncture an able candidate who had no political enemies in\\n', 'the sphere of national politics, Grover Cleveland, then governor of New\\n', 'York and widely celebrated as a man of \"sterling honesty.\" At the same\\n', 'time a number of dissatisfied Republicans openly espoused the Democratic\\n', 'cause,--among them Carl Schurz, George William Curtis, Henry Ward\\n', 'Beecher, and William Everett, men of fine ideals and undoubted\\n', 'integrity. Though the \"regular\" Republicans called them \"Mugwumps\" and\\n', 'laughed at them as the \"men milliners, the dilettanti, and carpet\\n', 'knights of politics,\" they had a following that was not to be despised.\\n', '\\n', 'The campaign which took place that year was one of the most savage in\\n', 'American history. Issues were thrust into the background. The tariff,\\n', 'though mentioned, was not taken seriously. Abuse of the opposition was\\n', 'the favorite resource of party orators. The Democrats insisted that \"the\\n', 'Republican party so far as principle is concerned is a reminiscence. In\\n', 'practice it is an organization for enriching those who control its\\n', 'machinery.\" For the Republican candidate, Blaine, they could hardly find\\n', 'words to express their contempt. The Republicans retaliated in kind.\\n', 'They praised their own good works, as of old, in saving the union, and\\n', 'denounced the \"fraud and violence practiced by the Democracy in the\\n', 'Southern states.\" Seeing little objectionable in the public record of\\n', 'Cleveland as mayor of Buffalo and governor of New York, they attacked\\n', 'his personal character. Perhaps never in the history of political\\n', 'campaigns did the discussions on the platform and in the press sink to\\n', 'so low a level. Decent people were sickened. Even hot partisans shrank\\n', 'from their own words when, after the election, they had time to reflect\\n', 'on their heedless passions. Moreover, nothing was decided by the\\n', 'balloting. Cleveland was elected, but his victory was a narrow one. A\\n', 'change of a few hundred votes in New York would have sent his opponent\\n', 'to the White House instead.\\n', '\\n', '=Changing Political Fortunes (1888-96).=--After the Democrats had\\n', 'settled down to the enjoyment of their hard-earned victory, President\\n', 'Cleveland in his message of 1887 attacked the tariff as \"vicious,\\n', 'inequitable, and illogical\"; as a system of taxation that laid a burden\\n', 'upon \"every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufacturers.\"\\n', 'Business enterprise was thoroughly alarmed. The Republicans\\n', 'characterized the tariff message as a free-trade assault upon the\\n', 'industries of the country. Mainly on that issue they elected in 1888\\n', 'Benjamin Harrison of Indiana, a shrewd lawyer, a reticent politician, a\\n', 'descendant of the hero of Tippecanoe, and a son of the old Northwest.\\n', 'Accepting the outcome of the election as a vindication of their\\n', 'principles, the Republicans, under the leadership of William McKinley in\\n', 'the House of Representatives, enacted in 1890 a tariff law imposing the\\n', 'highest duties yet laid in our history. To their utter surprise,\\n', 'however, they were instantly informed by the country that their program\\n', 'was not approved. That very autumn they lost in the congressional\\n', 'elections, and two years later they were decisively beaten in the\\n', 'presidential campaign, Cleveland once more leading his party to victory.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', 'L.H.

Between the\\n', 'near and far frontiers lay a vast reach of plain, desert, plateau, and\\n', 'mountain, almost wholly undeveloped. A broad domain, extending from\\n', 'Canada to Mexico, and embracing the regions now included in Washington,\\n', 'Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, the Dakotas, and\\n', 'Oklahoma, had fewer than half a million inhabitants.

Pressure had already been brought to bear on Congress\\n', 'to authorize the construction of a line and to grant land and money in\\n', 'its aid. Both the Democrats and Republicans approved the idea, but it\\n', 'was involved in the slavery controversy. Indeed it was submerged in it.\\n', 'Southern statesmen wanted connections between the Gulf and the Pacific\\n', 'through Texas, while Northerners stood out for a central route.\\n', '\\n', 'The North had its way during the war. Congress, by legislation initiated\\n', 'in 1862, provided for the immediate organization of companies to build a\\n', 'line from the Missouri River to California and made grants of land and\\n', 'loans of money to aid in the enterprise. The Western end, the Central\\n', 'Pacific, was laid out under the supervision of Leland Stanford. It was\\n', 'heavily financed by the Mormons of Utah and also by the state\\n', 'government, the ranchmen, miners, and business men of California; and it\\n', 'was built principally by Chinese labor. The Eastern end, the Union\\n', 'Pacific, starting at Omaha, was constructed mainly by veterans of the\\n', 'Civil War and immigrants from Ireland and Germany. In 1869 the two\\n', 'companies met near Ogden in Utah and the driving of the last spike,\\n', 'uniting the Atlantic and the Pacific, was the occasion of a great\\n', 'demonstration.\\n', '\\n', 'Other lines to the Pacific were projected at the same time; but the\\n', 'panic of 1873 checked railway enterprise for a while. With the revival\\n', 'of prosperity at the end of that decade, construction was renewed with\\n', 'vigor and the year 1883 marked a series of railway triumphs. In February\\n', 'trains were running from New Orleans through Houston, San Antonio, and\\n', 'Yuma to San Francisco, as a result of a union of the Texas Pacific with\\n', 'the Southern Pacific and its subsidiary corporations. In September the\\n', 'last spike was driven in the Northern Pacific at Helena, Montana. Lake\\n', 'Superior was connected with Puget Sound. The waters explored by Joliet\\n', 'and Marquette were joined to the waters plowed by Sir Francis Drake\\n', 'while he was searching for a route around the world. That same year also\\n', 'a third line was opened to the Pacific by way of the Atchison, Topeka\\n', 'and Santa Fe, making connections through Albuquerque and Needles with\\n', 'San Francisco. The fondest hopes of railway promoters seemed to be\\n', 'realized.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: UNITED STATES IN 1870]\\n', '\\n', '=Western Railways Precede Settlement.=--In the Old World and on our\\n', 'Atlantic seaboard, railways followed population and markets. In the Far\\n', 'West, railways usually preceded the people. Railway builders planned\\n', 'cities on paper before they laid tracks connecting them. They sent\\n', 'missionaries to spread the gospel of \"Western opportunity\" to people in\\n', 'the Middle West, in the Eastern cities, and in Southern states. Then\\n', 'they carried their enthusiastic converts bag and baggage in long trains\\n', 'to the distant Dakotas and still farther afield. So the development of\\n', 'the Far West was not left to the tedious processes of time. It was\\n', 'pushed by men of imagination--adventurers who made a romance of\\n', 'money-making and who had dreams of empire unequaled by many kings of the\\n', 'past.\\n', '\\n', 'These empire builders bought railway lands in huge tracts; they got more\\n', 'from the government; they overcame every obstacle of canon, mountain,\\n', 'and stream with the aid of science; they built cities according to the\\n', 'plans made by the engineers. Having the towns ready and railway and\\n', 'steamboat connections formed with the rest of the world, they carried\\n', 'out the people to use the railways, the steamships, the houses, and the\\n', 'land. It was in this way that \"the frontier speculator paved the way for\\n', 'the frontier agriculturalist who had to be near a market before he could\\n', 'farm.\" The spirit of this imaginative enterprise, which laid out\\n', 'railways and towns in advance of the people, is seen in an advertisement\\n', 'of that day: \"This extension will run 42 miles from York, northeast\\n', 'through the Island Lake country, and will have five good North Dakota\\n', 'towns. The stations on the line will be well equipped with elevators and\\n', 'will be constructed and ready for operation at the commencement of the\\n', 'grain season. Prospective merchants have been active in securing\\n', 'desirable locations at the different towns on the line. There are still\\n', 'opportunities for hotels, general merchandise, hardware, furniture, and\\n', 'drug stores, etc.\"\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'A TOWN ON THE PRAIRIE]\\n', '\\n', 'Among the railway promoters and builders in the West, James J. Hill,\\n', 'of the Great Northern and allied lines, was one of the most forceful\\n', 'figures. He knew that tracks and trains were useless without passengers\\n', 'and freight; without a population of farmers and town dwellers. He\\n', 'therefore organized publicity in the Virginias, Iowa, Ohio, Indiana,\\n', 'Illinois, Wisconsin, and Nebraska especially. He sent out agents to tell\\n', 'the story of Western opportunity in this vein: \"You see your children\\n', 'come out of school with no chance to get farms of their own because the\\n', \"cost of land in your older part of the country is so high that you can't\\n\", 'afford to buy land to start your sons out in life around you. They have\\n', 'to go to the cities to make a living or become laborers in the mills or\\n', 'hire out as farm hands. There is no future for them there. If you are\\n', 'doing well where you are and can safeguard the future of your children\\n', \"and see them prosper around you, don't leave here. But if you want\\n\", 'independence, if you are renting your land, if the money-lender is\\n', 'carrying you along and you are running behind year after year, you can\\n', 'do no worse by moving.... You farmers talk of free trade and protection\\n', \"and what this or that political party will do for you. Why don't you\\n\", 'vote a homestead for yourself? That is the only thing Uncle Sam will\\n', \"ever give you. Jim Hill hasn't an acre of land to sell you. We are not\\n\", \"in the real estate business. We don't want you to go out West and make a\\n\", 'failure of it because the rates at which we haul you and your goods make\\n', 'the first transaction a loss.... We must have landless men for a manless\\n', 'land.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Unlike steamship companies stimulating immigration to get the fares,\\n', 'Hill was seeking permanent settlers who would produce, manufacture, and\\n', 'use the railways as the means of exchange. Consequently he fixed low\\n', 'rates and let his passengers take a good deal of live stock and\\n', 'household furniture free. By doing this he made an appeal that was\\n', 'answered by eager families. In 1894 the vanguard of home seekers left\\n', 'Indiana in fourteen passenger coaches, filled with men, women, and\\n', 'children, and forty-eight freight cars carrying their household goods\\n', 'and live stock. In the ten years that followed, 100,000 people from the\\n', 'Middle West and the South, responding to his call, went to the Western\\n', 'country where they brought eight million acres of prairie land under\\n', 'cultivation.\\n', '\\n', 'When Hill got his people on the land, he took an interest in everything\\n', 'that increased the productivity of their labor. Was the output of food\\n', 'for his freight cars limited by bad drainage on the farms? Hill then\\n', 'interested himself in practical ways of ditching and tiling. Were\\n', 'farmers hampered in hauling their goods to his trains by bad roads? In\\n', 'that case, he urged upon the states the improvement of highways. Did the\\n', 'traffic slacken because the food shipped was not of the best quality?\\n', 'Then live stock must be improved and scientific farming promoted. Did\\n', 'the farmers need credit? Banks must be established close at hand to\\n', 'advance it. In all conferences on scientific farm management,\\n', 'conservation of natural resources, banking and credit in relation to\\n', 'agriculture and industry, Hill was an active participant. His was the\\n', 'long vision, seeing in conservation and permanent improvements the\\n', 'foundation of prosperity for the railways and the people.\\n', '\\n', 'Indeed, he neglected no opportunity to increase the traffic on the\\n', 'lines. He wanted no empty cars running in either direction and no wheat\\n', 'stored in warehouses for the lack of markets. So he looked to the Orient\\n', 'as well as to Europe as an outlet for the surplus of the farms. He sent\\n', 'agents to China and Japan to discover what American goods and produce\\n', 'those countries would consume and what manufactures they had to offer to\\n', 'Americans in exchange. To open the Pacific trade he bought two ocean\\n', 'monsters, the _Minnesota_ and the _Dakota_, thus preparing for\\n', 'emergencies West as well as East. When some Japanese came to the United\\n', 'States on their way to Europe to buy steel rails, Hill showed them how\\n', 'easy it was for them to make their purchase in this country and ship by\\n', 'way of American railways and American vessels. So the railway builder\\n', 'and promoter, who helped to break the virgin soil of the prairies, lived\\n', 'through the pioneer epoch and into the age of great finance. Before he\\n', 'died he saw the wheat fields of North Dakota linked with the spinning\\n', 'jennies of Manchester and the docks of Yokohama.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE EVOLUTION OF GRAZING AND AGRICULTURE\\n', '\\n', '=The Removal of the Indians.=--Unlike the frontier of New England in\\n', 'colonial days or that of Kentucky later, the advancing lines of home\\n', 'builders in the Far West had little difficulty with warlike natives.\\n', 'Indian attacks were made on the railway construction gangs; General\\n', 'Custer had his fatal battle with the Sioux in 1876 and there were minor\\n', 'brushes; but they were all of relatively slight consequence. The former\\n', 'practice of treating with the Indians as independent nations was\\n', 'abandoned in 1871 and most of them were concentrated in reservations\\n', 'where they were mainly supported by the government. The supervision of\\n', 'their affairs was vested in a board of commissioners created in 1869 and\\n', 'instructed to treat them as wards of the nation--a trust which\\n', 'unfortunately was often betrayed. A further step in Indian policy was\\n', 'taken in 1887 when provision was made for issuing lands to individual\\n', 'Indians, thus permitting them to become citizens and settle down among\\n', 'their white neighbors as farmers or cattle raisers. The disappearance of\\n', 'the buffalo, the main food supply of the wild Indians, had made them\\n', 'more tractable and more willing to surrender the freedom of the hunter\\n', 'for the routine of the reservation, ranch, or wheat field.\\n', '\\n', '=The Cowboy and Cattle Ranger.=--Between the frontier of farms and the\\n', 'mountains were plains and semi-arid regions in vast reaches suitable for\\n', 'grazing. As soon as the railways were open into the Missouri Valley,\\n', 'affording an outlet for stock, there sprang up to the westward cattle\\n', 'and sheep raising on an immense scale. The far-famed American cowboy was\\n', 'the hero in this scene. Great herds of cattle were bred in Texas; with\\n', 'the advancing spring and summer seasons, they were driven northward\\n', 'across the plains and over the buffalo trails. In a single year, 1884,\\n', 'it is estimated that nearly one million head of cattle were moved out of\\n', 'Texas to the North by four thousand cowboys, supplied with 30,000\\n', 'horses and ponies.\\n', '\\n', 'During the two decades from 1870 to 1890 both the cattle men and the\\n', 'sheep raisers had an almost free run of the plains, using public lands\\n', 'without paying for the privilege and waging war on one another over the\\n', 'possession of ranges. At length, however, both had to go, as the\\n', 'homesteaders and land companies came and fenced in the plain and desert\\n', 'with endless lines of barbed wire. Already in 1893 a writer familiar\\n', 'with the frontier lamented the passing of the picturesque days: \"The\\n', 'unique position of the cowboys among the Americans is jeopardized in a\\n', 'thousand ways. Towns are growing up on their pasture lands; irrigation\\n', 'schemes of a dozen sorts threaten to turn bunch-grass scenery into\\n', 'farm-land views; farmers are pre-empting valleys and the sides of\\n', 'waterways; and the day is not far distant when stock-raising must be\\n', \"done mainly in small herds, with winter corrals, and then the cowboy's\\n\", 'days will end. Even now his condition disappoints those who knew him\\n', 'only half a dozen years ago. His breed seems to have deteriorated and\\n', 'his ranks are filling with men who work for wages rather than for the\\n', 'love of the free life and bold companionship that once tempted men into\\n', 'that calling. Splendid Cheyenne saddles are less and less numerous in\\n', 'the outfits; the distinctive hat that made its way up from Mexico may or\\n', 'may not be worn; all the civil authorities in nearly all towns in the\\n', 'grazing country forbid the wearing of side arms; nobody shoots up these\\n', 'towns any more. The fact is the old simon-pure cowboy days are gone\\n', 'already.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Settlement under the Homestead Act of 1862.=--Two factors gave a\\n', 'special stimulus to the rapid settlement of Western lands which swept\\n', 'away the Indians and the cattle rangers. The first was the policy of the\\n', 'railway companies in selling large blocks of land received from the\\n', 'government at low prices to induce immigration. The second was the\\n', 'operation of the Homestead law passed in 1862. This measure practically\\n', 'closed the long controversy over the disposition of the public domain\\n', 'that was suitable for agriculture. It provided for granting, without any\\n', 'cost save a small registration fee, public lands in lots of 160 acres\\n', 'each to citizens and aliens who declared their intention of becoming\\n', 'citizens. The one important condition attached was that the settler\\n', 'should occupy the farm for five years before his title was finally\\n', 'confirmed. Even this stipulation was waived in the case of the Civil War\\n', 'veterans who were allowed to count their term of military service as a\\n', \"part of the five years' occupancy required. As the soldiers of the\\n\", 'Revolutionary and Mexican wars had advanced in great numbers to the\\n', 'frontier in earlier days, so now veterans led in the settlement of the\\n', 'middle border. Along with them went thousands of German, Irish, and\\n', 'Scandinavian immigrants, fresh from the Old World. Between 1867 and\\n', '1874, 27,000,000 acres were staked out in quarter-section farms. In\\n', 'twenty years (1860-80), the population of Nebraska leaped from 28,000 to\\n', 'almost half a million; Kansas from 100,000 to a million; Iowa from\\n', '600,000 to 1,600,000; and the Dakotas from 5000 to 140,000.\\n', '\\n', '=The Diversity of Western Agriculture.=--In soil, produce, and\\n', 'management, Western agriculture presented many contrasts to that of the\\n', 'East and South. In the region of arable and watered lands the typical\\n', 'American unit--the small farm tilled by the owner--appeared as usual;\\n', 'but by the side of it many a huge domain owned by foreign or Eastern\\n', 'companies and tilled by hired labor. Sometimes the great estate took the\\n', 'shape of the \"bonanza farm\" devoted mainly to wheat and corn and\\n', 'cultivated on a large scale by machinery. Again it assumed the form of\\n', 'the cattle ranch embracing tens of thousands of acres. Again it was a\\n', 'vast holding of diversified interest, such as the Santa Anita ranch near\\n', 'Los Angeles, a domain of 60,000 acres \"cultivated in a glorious sweep of\\n', 'vineyards and orange and olive orchards, rich sheep and cattle pastures\\n', 'and horse ranches, their life and customs handed down from the Spanish\\n', 'owners of the various ranches which were swept into one estate.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Irrigation.=--In one respect agriculture in the Far West was unique. In\\n', 'a large area spreading through eight states, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming,\\n', 'Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of adjoining\\n', 'states, the rainfall was so slight that the ordinary crops to which the\\n', 'American farmer was accustomed could not be grown at all. The Mormons\\n', 'were the first Anglo-Saxons to encounter aridity, and they were baffled\\n', 'at first; but they studied it and mastered it by magnificent irrigation\\n', 'systems. As other settlers poured into the West the problem of the\\n', 'desert was attacked with a will, some of them replying to the\\n', 'commiseration of Eastern farmers by saying that it was easier to scoop\\n', 'out an irrigation ditch than to cut forests and wrestle with stumps and\\n', 'stones. Private companies bought immense areas at low prices, built\\n', 'irrigation works, and disposed of their lands in small plots. Some\\n', 'ranchers with an instinct for water, like that of the miner for metal,\\n', 'sank wells into the dry sand and were rewarded with gushers that \"soused\\n', 'the thirsty desert and turned its good-for-nothing sand into\\n', 'good-for-anything loam.\" The federal government came to the aid of the\\n', 'arid regions in 1894 by granting lands to the states to be used for\\n', 'irrigation purposes. In this work Wyoming took the lead with a law which\\n', 'induced capitalists to invest in irrigation and at the same time\\n', 'provided for the sale of the redeemed lands to actual settlers. Finally\\n', 'in 1902 the federal government by its liberal Reclamation Act added its\\n', 'strength to that of individuals, companies, and states in conquering\\n', '\"arid America.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nowhere,\" writes Powell, a historian of the West, in his picturesque\\n', '_End of the Trail_, \"has the white man fought a more courageous fight or\\n', 'won a more brilliant victory than in Arizona. His weapons have been the\\n', 'transit and the level, the drill and the dredge, the pick and the spade;\\n', 'and the enemy which he has conquered has been the most stubborn of all\\n', 'foes--the hostile forces of Nature.... The story of how the white man\\n', 'within the space of less than thirty years penetrated, explored, and\\n', 'mapped this almost unknown region; of how he carried law, order, and\\n', 'justice into a section which had never had so much as a speaking\\n', 'acquaintance with any one of the three before; of how, realizing the\\n', 'necessity for means of communication, he built highways of steel across\\n', 'this territory from east to west and from north to south; of how,\\n', 'undismayed by the savageness of the countenance which the desert turned\\n', 'upon him, he laughed and rolled up his sleeves, and spat upon his hands,\\n', 'and slashed the face of the desert with canals and irrigating ditches,\\n', 'and filled those ditches with water brought from deep in the earth or\\n', 'high in the mountains; and of how, in the conquered and submissive soil,\\n', 'he replaced the aloe with alfalfa, the mesquite with maize, the cactus\\n', 'with cotton, forms one of the most inspiring chapters in our history. It\\n', 'is one of the epics of civilization, this reclamation of the Southwest,\\n', 'and its heroes, thank God, are Americans.\\n', '\\n', '\"Other desert regions have been redeemed by irrigation--Egypt, for\\n', 'example, and Mesopotamia and parts of the Sudan--but the people of all\\n', 'those regions lay stretched out in the shade of a convenient palm,\\n', 'metaphorically speaking, and waited for some one with more energy than\\n', 'themselves to come along and do the work. But the Arizonians, mindful of\\n', 'the fact that God, the government, and Carnegie help those who help\\n', 'themselves, spent their days wielding the pick and shovel, and their\\n', 'evenings in writing letters to Washington with toil-hardened hands.\\n', 'After a time the government was prodded into action and the great dams\\n', 'at Laguna and Roosevelt are the result. Then the people, organizing\\n', \"themselves into cooperative leagues and water-users' associations, took\\n\", 'up the work of reclamation where the government left off; it is to these\\n', 'energetic, persevering men who have drilled wells, plowed fields, and\\n', 'dug ditches through the length and breadth of that great region which\\n', 'stretches from Yuma to Tucson, that the metamorphosis of Arizona is\\n', 'due.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The effect of irrigation wherever introduced was amazing. Stretches of\\n', 'sand and sagebrush gave way to fertile fields bearing crops of wheat,\\n', 'corn, fruits, vegetables, and grass. Huge ranches grazed by browsing\\n', 'sheep were broken up into small plots. The cowboy and ranchman vanished.\\n', 'In their place rose the prosperous community--a community unlike the\\n', 'township of Iowa or the industrial center of the East. Its intensive\\n', 'tillage left little room for hired labor. Its small holdings drew\\n', 'families together in village life rather than dispersing them on the\\n', 'lonely plain. Often the development of water power in connection with\\n', 'irrigation afforded electricity for labor-saving devices and lifted many\\n', 'a burden that in other days fell heavily upon the shoulders of the\\n', 'farmer and his family.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'MINING AND MANUFACTURING IN THE WEST\\n', '\\n', '=Mineral Resources.=--In another important particular the Far West\\n', 'differed from the Mississippi Valley states. That was in the\\n', 'predominance of mining over agriculture throughout a vast section.\\n', 'Indeed it was the minerals rather than the land that attracted the\\n', 'pioneers who first opened the country. The discovery of gold in\\n', 'California in 1848 was the signal for the great rush of prospectors,\\n', 'miners, and promoters who explored the valleys, climbed the hills,\\n', 'washed the sands, and dug up the soil in their feverish search for gold,\\n', 'silver, copper, coal, and other minerals. In Nevada and Montana the\\n', 'development of mineral resources went on all during the Civil War. Alder\\n', 'Gulch became Virginia City in 1863; Last Chance Gulch was named Helena\\n', 'in 1864; and Confederate Gulch was christened Diamond City in 1865. At\\n', 'Butte the miners began operations in 1864 and within five years had\\n', \"washed out eight million dollars' worth of gold. Under the gold they\\n\", 'found silver; under silver they found copper.\\n', '\\n', 'Even at the end of the nineteenth century, after agriculture was well\\n', 'advanced and stock and sheep raising introduced on a large scale,\\n', 'minerals continued to be the chief source of wealth in a number of\\n', 'states. This was revealed by the figures for 1910. The gold, silver,\\n', 'iron, and copper of Colorado were worth more than the wheat, corn, and\\n', 'oats combined; the copper of Montana sold for more than all the cereals\\n', 'and four times the price of the wheat. The interest of Nevada was also\\n', 'mainly mining, the receipts from the mineral output being $43,000,000 or\\n', \"more than one-half the national debt of Hamilton's day. The yield of the\\n\", 'mines of Utah was worth four or five times the wheat crop; the coal of\\n', 'Wyoming brought twice as much as the great wool clip; the minerals of\\n', 'Arizona were totaled at $43,000,000 as against a wool clip reckoned at\\n', '$1,200,000; while in Idaho alone of this group of states did the wheat\\n', 'crop exceed in value the output of the mines.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Photograph from Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'LOGGING]\\n', '\\n', '=Timber Resources.=--The forests of the great West, unlike those of the\\n', 'Ohio Valley, proved a boon to the pioneers rather than a foe to be\\n', 'attacked. In Ohio and Indiana, for example, the frontier line of\\n', 'homemakers had to cut, roll, and burn thousands of trees before they\\n', 'could put out a crop of any size. Beyond the Mississippi, however,\\n', 'there were all ready for the breaking plow great reaches of almost\\n', 'treeless prairie, where every stick of timber was precious. In the other\\n', 'parts, often rough and mountainous, where stood primeval forests of the\\n', 'finest woods, the railroads made good use of the timber. They consumed\\n', 'acres of forests themselves in making ties, bridge timbers, and\\n', 'telegraph poles, and they laid a heavy tribute upon the forests for\\n', 'their annual upkeep. The surplus trees, such as had burdened the\\n', 'pioneers of the Northwest Territory a hundred years before, they carried\\n', 'off to markets on the east and west coasts.\\n', '\\n', '=Western Industries.=--The peculiar conditions of the Far West\\n', 'stimulated a rise of industries more rapid than is usual in new country.\\n', 'The mining activities which in many sections preceded agriculture called\\n', 'for sawmills to furnish timber for the mines and smelters to reduce and\\n', 'refine ores. The ranches supplied sheep and cattle for the packing\\n', 'houses of Kansas City as well as Chicago. The waters of the Northwest\\n', 'afforded salmon for 4000 cases in 1866 and for 1,400,000 cases in 1916.\\n', 'The fruits and vegetables of California brought into existence\\n', 'innumerable canneries. The lumber industry, starting with crude sawmills\\n', 'to furnish rough timbers for railways and mines, ended in specialized\\n', 'factories for paper, boxes, and furniture. As the railways preceded\\n', 'settlement and furnished a ready outlet for local manufactures, so they\\n', 'encouraged the early establishment of varied industries, thus creating a\\n', 'state of affairs quite unlike that which obtained in the Ohio Valley in\\n', 'the early days before the opening of the Erie Canal.\\n', '\\n', '=Social Effects of Economic Activities.=--In many respects the social\\n', 'life of the Far West also differed from that of the Ohio Valley. The\\n', 'treeless prairies, though open to homesteads, favored the great estate\\n', 'tilled in part by tenant labor and in part by migratory seasonal labor,\\n', 'summoned from all sections of the country for the harvests. The mineral\\n', 'resources created hundreds of huge fortunes which made the accumulations\\n', 'of eastern mercantile families look trivial by comparison. Other\\n', 'millionaires won their fortunes in the railway business and still more\\n', 'from the cattle and sheep ranges. In many sections the \"cattle king,\" as\\n', 'he was called, was as dominant as the planter had been in the old South.\\n', 'Everywhere in the grazing country he was a conspicuous and important\\n', 'person. He \"sometimes invested money in banks, in railroad stocks, or in\\n', 'city property.... He had his rating in the commercial reviews and could\\n', 'hobnob with bankers, railroad presidents, and metropolitan merchants....\\n', 'He attended party caucuses and conventions, ran for the state\\n', \"legislature, and sometimes defeated a lawyer or metropolitan 'business\\n\", \"man' in the race for a seat in Congress. In proportion to their numbers,\\n\", 'the ranchers ... have constituted a highly impressive class.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Although many of the early capitalists of the great West, especially\\n', 'from Nevada, spent their money principally in the East, others took\\n', 'leadership in promoting the sections in which they had made their\\n', 'fortunes. A railroad pioneer, General Palmer, built his home at Colorado\\n', 'Springs, founded the town, and encouraged local improvements. Denver\\n', 'owed its first impressive buildings to the civic patriotism of Horace\\n', 'Tabor, a wealthy mine owner. Leland Stanford paid his tribute to\\n', 'California in the endowment of a large university. Colonel W.F. Cody,\\n', 'better known as \"Buffalo Bill,\" started his career by building a \"boom\\n', 'town\" which collapsed, and made a large sum of money supplying buffalo\\n', 'meat to construction hands (hence his popular name). By his famous Wild\\n', 'West Show, he increased it to a fortune which he devoted mainly to the\\n', 'promotion of a western reclamation scheme.\\n', '\\n', 'While the Far West was developing this vigorous, aggressive leadership\\n', 'in business, a considerable industrial population was springing up. Even\\n', 'the cattle ranges and hundreds of farms were conducted like factories in\\n', 'that they were managed through overseers who hired plowmen, harvesters,\\n', 'and cattlemen at regular wages. At the same time there appeared other\\n', 'peculiar features which made a lasting impression on western economic\\n', 'life. Mining, lumbering, and fruit growing, for instance, employed\\n', 'thousands of workers during the rush months and turned them out at other\\n', 'times. The inevitable result was an army of migratory laborers wandering\\n', 'from camp to camp, from town to town, and from ranch to ranch, without\\n', 'fixed homes or established habits of life. From this extraordinary\\n', 'condition there issued many a long and lawless conflict between capital\\n', 'and labor, giving a distinct color to the labor movement in whole\\n', 'sections of the mountain and coast states.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE ADMISSION OF NEW STATES\\n', '\\n', '=The Spirit of Self-Government.=--The instinct of self-government was\\n', 'strong in the western communities. In the very beginning, it led to the\\n', 'organization of volunteer committees, known as \"vigilantes,\" to suppress\\n', 'crime and punish criminals. As soon as enough people were settled\\n', 'permanently in a region, they took care to form a more stable kind of\\n', 'government. An illustration of this process is found in the Oregon\\n', 'compact made by the pioneers in 1843, the spirit of which is reflected\\n', 'in an editorial in an old copy of the _Rocky Mountain News_: \"We claim\\n', 'that any body or community of American citizens which from any cause or\\n', 'under any circumstances is cut off from or from isolation is so situated\\n', 'as not to be under any active and protecting branch of the central\\n', 'government, have a right, if on American soil, to frame a government and\\n', 'enact such laws and regulations as may be necessary for their own\\n', 'safety, protection, and happiness, always with the condition precedent,\\n', 'that they shall, at the earliest moment when the central government\\n', 'shall extend an effective organization and laws over them, give it their\\n', 'unqualified support and obedience.\"\\n', '\\n', 'People who turned so naturally to the organization of local\\n', 'administration were equally eager for admission to the union as soon as\\n', 'any shadow of a claim to statehood could be advanced. As long as a\\n', 'region was merely one of the territories of the United States, the\\n', 'appointment of the governor and other officers was controlled by\\n', 'politics at Washington. Moreover the disposition of land, mineral\\n', 'rights, forests, and water power was also in the hands of national\\n', 'leaders. Thus practical considerations were united with the spirit of\\n', 'independence in the quest for local autonomy.\\n', '\\n', '=Nebraska and Colorado.=--Two states, Nebraska and Colorado, had little\\n', 'difficulty in securing admission to the union. The first, Nebraska, had\\n', 'been organized as a territory by the famous Kansas-Nebraska bill which\\n', 'did so much to precipitate the Civil War. Lying to the north of Kansas,\\n', 'which had been admitted in 1861, it escaped the invasion of slave owners\\n', 'from Missouri and was settled mainly by farmers from the North. Though\\n', 'it claimed a population of only 67,000, it was regarded with kindly\\n', 'interest by the Republican Congress at Washington and, reduced to its\\n', 'present boundaries, it received the coveted statehood in 1867.\\n', '\\n', 'This was hardly accomplished before the people of Colorado to the\\n', 'southwest began to make known their demands. They had been organized\\n', 'under territorial government in 1861 when they numbered only a handful;\\n', 'but within ten years the aspect of their affairs had completely changed.\\n', 'The silver and gold deposits of the Leadville and Cripple Creek regions\\n', 'had attracted an army of miners and prospectors. The city of Denver,\\n', 'founded in 1858 and named after the governor of Kansas whence came many\\n', 'of the early settlers, had grown from a straggling camp of log huts into\\n', 'a prosperous center of trade. By 1875 it was reckoned that the\\n', 'population of the territory was not less than one hundred thousand; the\\n', 'following year Congress, yielding to the popular appeal, made Colorado a\\n', 'member of the American union.\\n', '\\n', '=Six New States (1889-1890).=--For many years there was a deadlock in\\n', 'Congress over the admission of new states. The spell was broken in 1889\\n', 'under the leadership of the Dakotas. For a long time the Dakota\\n', 'territory, organized in 1861, had been looked upon as the home of the\\n', 'powerful Sioux Indians whose enormous reservation blocked the advance of\\n', 'the frontier. The discovery of gold in the Black Hills, however, marked\\n', 'their doom. Even before Congress could open their lands to prospectors,\\n', 'pioneers were swarming over the country. Farmers from the adjoining\\n', 'Minnesota and the Eastern states, Scandinavians, Germans, and Canadians,\\n', 'came in swelling waves to occupy the fertile Dakota lands, now famous\\n', 'even as far away as the fjords of Norway. Seldom had the plow of man cut\\n', 'through richer soil than was found in the bottoms of the Red River\\n', 'Valley, and it became all the more precious when the opening of the\\n', 'Northern Pacific in 1883 afforded a means of transportation east and\\n', 'west. The population, which had numbered 135,000 in 1880, passed the\\n', 'half million mark before ten years had elapsed.\\n', '\\n', 'Remembering that Nebraska had been admitted with only 67,000\\n', 'inhabitants, the Dakotans could not see why they should be kept under\\n', 'federal tutelage. At the same time Washington, far away on the Pacific\\n', 'Coast, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, boasting of their populations and\\n', 'their riches, put in their own eloquent pleas. But the members of\\n', 'Congress were busy with politics. The Democrats saw no good reason for\\n', 'admitting new Republican states until after their defeat in 1888. Near\\n', 'the end of their term the next year they opened the door for North and\\n', 'South Dakota, Washington, and Montana. In 1890, a Republican Congress\\n', 'brought Idaho and Wyoming into the union, the latter with woman\\n', 'suffrage, which had been granted twenty-one years before.\\n', '\\n', '=Utah.=--Although Utah had long presented all the elements of a\\n', 'well-settled and industrious community, its admission to the union was\\n', 'delayed on account of popular hostility to the practice of polygamy. The\\n', 'custom, it is true, had been prohibited by act of Congress in 1862; but\\n', 'the law had been systematically evaded. In 1882 Congress made another\\n', 'and more effective effort to stamp out polygamy. Five years later it\\n', 'even went so far as to authorize the confiscation of the property of the\\n', 'Mormon Church in case the practice of plural marriages was not stopped.\\n', 'Meanwhile the Gentile or non-Mormon population was steadily increasing\\n', 'and the leaders in the Church became convinced that the battle\\n', 'against the sentiment of the country was futile. At last in 1896 Utah\\n', 'was admitted as a state under a constitution which forbade plural\\n', 'marriages absolutely and forever. Horace Greeley, who visited Utah in\\n', '1859, had prophesied that the Pacific Railroad would work a revolution\\n', 'in the land of Brigham Young. His prophecy had come true.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1912]\\n', '\\n', '=Rounding out the Continent.=--Three more territories now remained out\\n', 'of the Union. Oklahoma, long an Indian reservation, had been opened for\\n', 'settlement to white men in 1889. The rush upon the fertile lands of this\\n', 'region, the last in the history of America, was marked by all the frenzy\\n', 'of the final, desperate chance. At a signal from a bugle an army of men\\n', 'with families in wagons, men and women on horseback and on foot, burst\\n', 'into the territory. During the first night a city of tents was raised at\\n', 'Guthrie and Oklahoma City. In ten days wooden houses rose on the plains.\\n', 'In a single year there were schools, churches, business blocks, and\\n', 'newspapers. Within fifteen years there was a population of more than\\n', 'half a million. To the west, Arizona with a population of about 125,000\\n', 'and New Mexico with 200,000 inhabitants joined Oklahoma in asking for\\n', 'statehood. Congress, then Republican, looked with reluctance upon the\\n', 'addition of more Democratic states; but in 1907 it was literally\\n', 'compelled by public sentiment and a sense of justice to admit Oklahoma.\\n', 'In 1910 the House of Representatives went to the Democrats and within\\n', 'two years Arizona and New Mexico were \"under the roof.\" So the\\n', 'continental domain was rounded out.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE INFLUENCE OF THE FAR WEST ON NATIONAL LIFE\\n', '\\n', '=The Last of the Frontier.=--When Horace Greeley made his trip west in\\n', '1859 he thus recorded the progress of civilization in his journal:\\n', '\\n', '     \"May 12th, Chicago.--Chocolate and morning journals last\\n', '     seen on the hotel breakfast table.\\n', '\\n', '     23rd, Leavenworth (Kansas).--Room bells and bath tubs make\\n', '     their final appearance.\\n', '\\n', '     26th, Manhattan.--Potatoes and eggs last recognized among\\n', \"     the blessings that 'brighten as they take their flight.'\\n\", '\\n', '     27th, Junction City.--Last visitation of a boot-black, with\\n', '     dissolving views of a board bedroom.

Of far more consequence was the\\n', 'disappearance of free lands with all that meant for American labor. For\\n', 'more than a hundred years, any man of even moderate means had been able\\n', 'to secure a homestead of his own and an independent livelihood. For a\\n', 'hundred years America had been able to supply farms to as many\\n', 'immigrants as cared to till the soil. Every new pair of strong arms\\n', 'meant more farms and more wealth. Workmen in Eastern factories, mines,\\n', 'or mills who did not like their hours, wages, or conditions of labor,\\n', 'could readily find an outlet to the land. Now all that was over. By\\n', 'about 1890 most of the desirable land available under the Homestead act\\n', 'had disappeared. American industrial workers confronted a new situation.\\n', '\\n', '=Grain Supplants King Cotton.=--In the meantime a revolution was taking\\n', 'place in agriculture. Until 1860 the chief staples sold by America were\\n', 'cotton and tobacco. With the advance of the frontier, corn and wheat\\n', 'supplanted them both in agrarian economy. The West became the granary of\\n', 'the East and of Western Europe. The scoop shovel once used to handle\\n', 'grain was superseded by the towering elevator, loading and unloading\\n', 'thousands of bushels every hour. The refrigerator car and ship made the\\n', 'packing industry as stable as the production of cotton or corn, and gave\\n', 'an immense impetus to cattle raising and sheep farming. So the meat of\\n', 'the West took its place on the English dinner table by the side of bread\\n', 'baked from Dakotan wheat.\\n', '\\n', '=Aid in American Economic Independence.=--The effects of this economic\\n', \"movement were manifold and striking. Billions of dollars' worth of\\n\", 'American grain, dairy produce, and meat were poured into European\\n', 'markets where they paid off debts due money lenders and acquired\\n', 'capital to develop American resources. Thus they accelerated the\\n', 'progress of American financiers toward national independence. The\\n', 'country, which had timidly turned to the Old World for capital in\\n', \"Hamilton's day and had borrowed at high rates of interest in London in\\n\", \"Lincoln's day, moved swiftly toward the time when it would be among the\\n\", \"world's first bankers and money lenders itself. Every grain of wheat and\\n\", 'corn pulled the balance down on the American side of the scale.\\n', '\\n', '=Eastern Agriculture Affected.=--In the East as well as abroad the\\n', 'opening of the western granary produced momentous results. The\\n', 'agricultural economy of that part of the country was changed in many\\n', 'respects. Whole sections of the poorest land went almost out of\\n', 'cultivation, the abandoned farms of the New England hills bearing solemn\\n', 'witness to the competing power of western wheat fields. Sheep and cattle\\n', 'raising, as well as wheat and corn production, suffered at least a\\n', 'relative decline. Thousands of farmers cultivating land of the lower\\n', 'grade were forced to go West or were driven to the margin of\\n', 'subsistence. Even the herds that supplied Eastern cities with milk were\\n', 'fed upon grain brought halfway across the continent.\\n', '\\n', '=The Expansion of the American Market.=--Upon industry as well as\\n', 'agriculture, the opening of vast food-producing regions told in a\\n', 'thousand ways. The demand for farm machinery, clothing, boots, shoes,\\n', 'and other manufactures gave to American industries such a market as even\\n', 'Hamilton had never foreseen. Moreover it helped to expand far into the\\n', 'Mississippi Valley the industrial area once confined to the Northern\\n', 'seaboard states and to transform the region of the Great Lakes into an\\n', 'industrial empire. Herein lies the explanation of the growth of\\n', 'mid-western cities after 1865. Chicago, with its thirty-five railways,\\n', 'tapped every locality of the West and South. To the railways were added\\n', 'the water routes of the Lakes, thus creating a strategic center for\\n', 'industries. Long foresight carried the McCormick reaper works to\\n', 'Chicago before 1860. From Troy, New York, went a large stove plant. That\\n', 'was followed by a shoe factory from Massachusetts. The packing industry\\n', 'rose as a matter of course at a point so advantageous for cattle raisers\\n', 'and shippers and so well connected with Eastern markets.\\n', '\\n', 'To the opening of the Far West also the Lake region was indebted for a\\n', 'large part of that water-borne traffic which made it \"the Mediterranean\\n', 'basin of North America.\" The produce of the West and the manufactures of\\n', 'the East poured through it in an endless stream. The swift growth of\\n', 'shipbuilding on the Great Lakes helped to compensate for the decline of\\n', 'the American marine on the high seas. In response to this stimulus\\n', 'Detroit could boast that her shipwrights were able to turn out a ten\\n', 'thousand ton Leviathan for ore or grain about \"as quickly as carpenters\\n', 'could put up an eight-room house.\" Thus in relation to the Far West the\\n', \"old Northwest territory--the wilderness of Jefferson's time--had taken\\n\", 'the position formerly occupied by New England alone. It was supplying\\n', 'capital and manufactures for a vast agricultural empire West and South.\\n', '\\n', '=America on the Pacific.=--It has been said that the Mediterranean Sea\\n', 'was the center of ancient civilization; that modern civilization has\\n', 'developed on the shores of the Atlantic; and that the future belongs to\\n', 'the Pacific. At any rate, the sweep of the United States to the shores\\n', 'of the Pacific quickly exercised a powerful influence on world affairs\\n', 'and it undoubtedly has a still greater significance for the future.\\n', '\\n', 'Very early regular traffic sprang up between the Pacific ports and the\\n', 'Hawaiian Islands, China, and Japan. Two years before the adjustment of\\n', 'the Oregon controversy with England, namely in 1844, the United States\\n', 'had established official and trading relations with China. Ten years\\n', 'later, four years after the admission of California to the union, the\\n', 'barred door of Japan was forced open by Commodore Perry. The commerce\\n', 'which had long before developed between the Pacific ports and Hawaii,\\n', 'China, and Japan now flourished under official care. In 1865 a ship\\n', 'from Honolulu carried sugar, molasses, and fruits from Hawaii to the\\n', 'Oregon port of Astoria. The next year a vessel from Hongkong brought\\n', 'rice, mats, and tea from China. An era of lucrative trade was opened.\\n', 'The annexation of Hawaii in 1898, the addition of the Philippines at the\\n', 'same time, and the participation of American troops in the suppression\\n', 'of the Boxer rebellion in Peking in 1900, were but signs and symbols of\\n', 'American power on the Pacific.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', \"COMMODORE PERRY'S MEN MAKING PRESENTS TO THE JAPANESE]\\n\", '\\n', '=Conservation and the Land Problem.=--The disappearance of the frontier\\n', 'also brought new and serious problems to the governments of the states\\n', 'and the nation. The people of the whole United States suddenly were\\n', 'forced to realize that there was a limit to the rich, new land to\\n', 'exploit and to the forests and minerals awaiting the ax and the pick.\\n', 'Then arose in America the questions which had long perplexed the\\n', 'countries of the Old World--the scientific use of the soils and\\n', 'conservation of natural resources. Hitherto the government had followed\\n', 'the easy path of giving away arable land and selling forest and mineral\\n', 'lands at low prices. Now it had to face far more difficult and complex\\n', 'problems. It also had to consider questions of land tenure again,\\n', 'especially if the ideal of a nation of home-owning farmers was to be\\n', 'maintained. While there was plenty of land for every man or woman who\\n', 'wanted a home on the soil, it made little difference if single landlords\\n', 'or companies got possession of millions of acres, if a hundred men in\\n', 'one western river valley owned 17,000,000 acres; but when the good land\\n', 'for small homesteads was all gone, then was raised the real issue. At\\n', 'the opening of the twentieth century the nation, which a hundred years\\n', 'before had land and natural resources apparently without limit, was\\n', 'compelled to enact law after law conserving its forests and minerals.\\n', 'Then it was that the great state of California, on the very border of\\n', 'the continent, felt constrained to enact a land settlement measure\\n', 'providing government assistance in an effort to break up large holdings\\n', 'into small lots and to make it easy for actual settlers to acquire small\\n', 'farms.

During none\\n', 'of that time was there a clash of opinion over specific issues such as\\n', 'rent the country in 1800 when Jefferson rode a popular wave to victory,\\n', \"or again in 1828 when Jackson's western hordes came sweeping into power.\\n\", 'The Democrats, who before 1860 definitely opposed protective tariffs,\\n', 'federal banking, internal improvements, and heavy taxes, now spoke\\n', 'cautiously on all these points. The Republicans, conscious of the fact\\n', 'that they had been a minority of the voters in 1860 and warned by the\\n', 'early loss of the House of Representatives in 1874, also moved with\\n', 'considerable prudence among the perplexing problems of the day. Again\\n', 'and again the votes in Congress showed that no clear line separated all\\n', 'the Democrats from all the Republicans. There were Republicans who\\n', 'favored tariff reductions and \"cheap money.\" There were Democrats who\\n', 'looked with partiality upon high protection or with indulgence upon the\\n', 'contraction of the currency. Only on matters relating to the coercion of\\n', 'the South was the division between the parties fairly definite; this\\n', 'could be readily accounted for on practical as well as sentimental\\n', 'grounds.\\n', '\\n', 'After all, the vague criticisms and proposals that found their way into\\n', 'the political platforms did but reflect the confusion of mind prevailing\\n', 'in the country. The fact that, out of the eighteen years between 1875\\n', 'and 1893, the Democrats held the House of Representatives for fourteen\\n', 'years while the Republicans had every President but one showed that the\\n', 'voters, like the politicians, were in a state of indecision. Hayes had a\\n', 'Democratic House during his entire term and a Democratic Senate for two\\n', 'years of the four. Cleveland was confronted by a belligerent Republican\\n', 'majority in the Senate during his first administration; and at the same\\n', 'time was supported by a Democratic majority in the House. Harrison was\\n', 'sustained by continuous Republican successes in Senatorial elections;\\n', 'but in the House he had the barest majority from 1889 to 1891 and lost\\n', 'that altogether at the election held in the middle of his term. The\\n', 'opinion of the country was evidently unsettled and fluctuating. It was\\n', 'still distracted by memories of the dead past and uncertain as to the\\n', 'trend of the future.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE CURRENCY QUESTION\\n', '\\n', 'Nevertheless these years of muddled politics and nebulous issues proved\\n', 'to be a period in which social forces were gathering for the great\\n', 'campaign of 1896. Except for three new features--the railways, the\\n', 'trusts, and the trade unions--the subjects of debate among the people\\n', 'were the same as those that had engaged their attention since the\\n', 'foundation of the republic: the currency, the national debt, banking,\\n', 'the tariff, and taxation.\\n', '\\n', '=Debtors and the Fall in Prices.=--For many reasons the currency\\n', 'question occupied the center of interest. As of old, the farmers and\\n', 'planters of the West and South were heavily in debt to the East for\\n', 'borrowed money secured by farm mortgages; and they counted upon the sale\\n', 'of cotton, corn, wheat, and hogs to meet interest and principal when\\n', 'due. During the war, the Western farmers had been able to dispose of\\n', 'their produce at high prices and thus discharge their debts with\\n', 'comparative ease; but after the war prices declined. Wheat that sold at\\n', 'two dollars a bushel in 1865 brought sixty-four cents twenty years\\n', 'later. The meaning of this for the farmers in debt--and nearly\\n', 'three-fourths of them were in that class--can be shown by a single\\n', 'illustration. A thousand-dollar mortgage on a Western farm could be paid\\n', 'off by five hundred bushels of wheat when prices were high; whereas it\\n', 'took about fifteen hundred bushels to pay the same debt when wheat was\\n', 'at the bottom of the scale. For the farmer, it must be remembered, wheat\\n', 'was the measure of his labor, the product of his toil under the summer\\n', 'sun; and in its price he found the test of his prosperity.\\n', '\\n', '=Creditors and Falling Prices.=--To the bondholders or creditors, on the\\n', 'other hand, falling prices were clear gain. If a fifty-dollar coupon on\\n', 'a bond bought seventy or eighty bushels of wheat instead of twenty or\\n', 'thirty, the advantage to the owner of the coupon was obvious. Moreover\\n', 'the advantage seemed to him entirely just. Creditors had suffered heavy\\n', 'losses when the Civil War carried prices skyward while the interest\\n', 'rates on their old bonds remained stationary. For example, if a man had\\n', 'a $1000 bond issued before 1860 and paying interest at five per cent, he\\n', 'received fifty dollars a year from it. Before the war each dollar would\\n', 'buy a bushel of wheat; in 1865 it would only buy half a bushel. When\\n', 'prices--that is, the cost of living--began to go down, creditors\\n', 'therefore generally regarded the change with satisfaction as a return to\\n', 'normal conditions.\\n', '\\n', '=The Cause of Falling Prices.=--The fall in prices was due, no doubt, to\\n', 'many factors. Among them must be reckoned the discontinuance of\\n', 'government buying for war purposes, labor-saving farm machinery,\\n', 'immigration, and the opening of new wheat-growing regions. The currency,\\n', 'too, was an element in the situation. Whatever the cause, the\\n', 'discontented farmers believed that the way to raise prices was to issue\\n', 'more money. They viewed it as a case of supply and demand. If there was\\n', 'a small volume of currency in circulation, prices would be low; if there\\n', 'was a large volume, prices would be high. Hence they looked with favor\\n', 'upon all plans to increase the amount of money in circulation. First\\n', 'they advocated more paper notes--greenbacks--and then they turned to\\n', 'silver as the remedy. The creditors, on the other hand, naturally\\n', 'approved the reduction of the volume of currency. They wished to see the\\n', 'greenbacks withdrawn from circulation and gold--a metal more limited in\\n', 'volume than silver--made the sole basis of the national monetary system.\\n', '\\n', '=The Battle over the Greenbacks.=--The contest between these factions\\n', 'began as early as 1866. In that year, Congress enacted a law authorizing\\n', 'the Treasury to withdraw the greenbacks from circulation. The paper\\n', 'money party set up a shrill cry of protest, and kept up the fight until,\\n', 'in 1878, it forced Congress to provide for the continuous re-issue of\\n', 'the legal tender notes as they came into the Treasury in payment of\\n', 'taxes and other dues. Then could the friends of easy money rejoice:\\n', '\\n', '    \"Thou, Greenback, \\'tis of thee\\n', '     Fair money of the free,\\n', '      Of thee we sing.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Resumption of Specie Payment.=--There was, however, another side to\\n', 'this victory. The opponents of the greenbacks, unable to stop the\\n', 'circulation of paper, induced Congress to pass a law in 1875 providing\\n', 'that on and after January 1, 1879, \"the Secretary of the Treasury shall\\n', 'redeem in coin the United States legal tender notes then outstanding on\\n', 'their presentation at the office of the Assistant Treasurer of the\\n', 'United States in the City of New York in sums of not less than fifty\\n', 'dollars.\" \"The way to resume,\" John Sherman had said, \"is to resume.\"\\n', 'When the hour for redemption arrived, the Treasury was prepared with a\\n', 'large hoard of gold. \"On the appointed day,\" wrote the assistant\\n', 'secretary, \"anxiety reigned in the office of the Treasury. Hour after\\n', 'hour passed; no news from New York. Inquiry by wire showed that all was\\n', \"quiet. At the close of the day this message came: '$135,000 of notes\\n\", \"presented for coin--$400,000 of gold for notes.' That was all.\\n\", \"Resumption was accomplished with no disturbance. By five o'clock the\\n\", 'news was all over the land, and the New York bankers were sipping their\\n', 'tea in absolute safety.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Specie Problem--the Parity of Gold and Silver.=--Defeated in their\\n', 'efforts to stop \"the present suicidal and destructive policy of\\n', 'contraction,\" the advocates of an abundant currency demanded an increase\\n', 'in the volume of silver in circulation. This precipitated one of the\\n', 'sharpest political battles in American history. The issue turned on\\n', 'legal as well as economic points. The Constitution gave Congress the\\n', 'power to coin money and it forbade the states to make anything but gold\\n', 'and silver legal tender in the payment of debts. It evidently\\n', 'contemplated the use of both metals in the currency system. Such, at\\n', 'least, was the view of many eminent statesmen, including no less a\\n', 'personage than James G. Blaine. The difficulty, however, lay in\\n', 'maintaining gold and silver coins on a level which would permit them to\\n', 'circulate with equal facility. Obviously, if the gold in a gold dollar\\n', 'exceeds the value of the silver in a silver dollar on the open market,\\n', 'men will hoard gold money and leave silver money in circulation. When,\\n', 'for example, Congress in 1792 fixed the ratio of the two metals at one\\n', 'to fifteen--one ounce of gold declared worth fifteen of silver--it was\\n', 'soon found that gold had been undervalued. When again in 1834 the ratio\\n', 'was put at one to sixteen, it was found that silver was undervalued.\\n', 'Consequently the latter metal was not brought in for coinage and silver\\n', 'almost dropped out of circulation. Many a silver dollar was melted down\\n', 'by silverware factories.\\n', '\\n', '=Silver Demonetized in 1873.=--So things stood in 1873. At that time,\\n', 'Congress, in enacting a mintage law, discontinued the coinage of the\\n', 'standard silver dollar, then practically out of circulation. This act\\n', 'was denounced later by the friends of silver as \"the crime of \\'73,\" a\\n', 'conspiracy devised by the money power and secretly carried out. This\\n', 'contention the debates in Congress do not seem to sustain. In the course\\n', 'of the argument on the mint law it was distinctly said by one speaker at\\n', 'least: \"This bill provides for the making of changes in the legal tender\\n', 'coin of the country and for substituting as legal tender, coin of only\\n', 'one metal instead of two as heretofore.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Decline in the Value of Silver.=--Absorbed in the greenback\\n', 'controversy, the people apparently did not appreciate, at the time, the\\n', 'significance of the \"demonetization\" of silver; but within a few years\\n', 'several events united in making it the center of a political storm.\\n', 'Germany, having abandoned silver in 1871, steadily increased her demand\\n', 'for gold. Three years later, the countries of the Latin Union followed\\n', 'this example, thus helping to enhance the price of the yellow metal. All\\n', 'the while, new silver lodes, discovered in the Far West, were pouring\\n', 'into the market great streams of the white metal, bearing down the\\n', 'price. Then came the resumption of specie payment, which, in effect,\\n', 'placed the paper money on a gold basis. Within twenty years silver was\\n', 'worth in gold only about half the price of 1870.\\n', '\\n', 'That there had been a real decline in silver was denied by the friends\\n', 'of that metal. They alleged that gold had gone up because it had been\\n', 'given a monopoly in the coinage markets of civilized governments. This\\n', 'monopoly, they continued, was the fruit of a conspiracy against the\\n', 'people conceived by the bankers of the world. Moreover, they went on,\\n', 'the placing of the greenbacks on a gold basis had itself worked a\\n', 'contraction of the currency; it lowered the prices of labor and produce\\n', 'to the advantage of the holders of long-term investments bearing a fixed\\n', 'rate of interest. When wheat sold at sixty-four cents a bushel, their\\n', 'search for relief became desperate, and they at last concentrated their\\n', 'efforts on opening the mints of the government for the free coinage of\\n', 'silver at the ratio of sixteen to one.\\n', '\\n', '=Republicans and Democrats Divided.=--On this question both Republicans\\n', 'and Democrats were divided, the line being drawn between the East on the\\n', 'one hand and the South and West on the other, rather than between the\\n', 'two leading parties. So trusted a leader as James G. Blaine avowed, in a\\n', 'speech delivered in the Senate in 1878, that, as the Constitution\\n', 'required Congress to make both gold and silver the money of the land,\\n', 'the only question left was that of fixing the ratio between them. He\\n', 'affirmed, moreover, the main contention of the silver faction that a\\n', 'reopening of the government mints of the world to silver would bring it\\n', 'up to its old relation with gold. He admitted also that their most\\n', 'ominous warnings were well founded, saying: \"I believe the struggle now\\n', 'going on in this country and in other countries for a single gold\\n', 'standard would, if successful, produce widespread disaster throughout\\n', 'the commercial world. The destruction of silver as money and the\\n', 'establishment of gold as the sole unit of value must have a ruinous\\n', 'effect on all forms of property, except those investments which yield a\\n', 'fixed return.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This was exactly the concession that the silver party wanted.\\n', '\"Three-fourths of the business enterprises of this country are conducted\\n', 'on borrowed capital,\" said Senator Jones, of Nevada. \"Three-fourths of\\n', 'the homes and farms that stand in the names of the actual occupants have\\n', 'been bought on time and a very large proportion of them are mortgaged\\n', 'for the payment of some part of the purchase money. Under the operation\\n', 'of a shrinkage in the volume of money, this enormous mass of borrowers,\\n', 'at the maturity of their respective debts, though nominally paying no\\n', 'more than the amount borrowed, with interest, are in reality, in the\\n', 'amount of the principal alone, returning a percentage of value greater\\n', 'than they received--more in equity than they contracted to pay.... In\\n', 'all discussions of the subject the creditors attempt to brush aside the\\n', 'equities involved by sneering at the debtors.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Silver Purchase Act (1878).=--Even before the actual resumption of\\n', 'specie payment, the advocates of free silver were a power to be reckoned\\n', 'with, particularly in the Democratic party. They had a majority in the\\n', 'House of Representatives in 1878 and they carried a silver bill through\\n', 'that chamber. Blocked by the Republican Senate they accepted a\\n', 'compromise in the Bland-Allison bill, which provided for huge monthly\\n', 'purchases of silver by the government for coinage into dollars. So\\n', 'strong was the sentiment that a two-thirds majority was mustered after\\n', 'President Hayes vetoed the measure.\\n', '\\n', 'The effect of this act, as some had anticipated, was disappointing. It\\n', 'did not stay silver on its downward course. Thereupon the silver faction\\n', 'pressed through Congress in 1886 a bill providing for the issue of paper\\n', 'certificates based on the silver accumulated in the Treasury. Still\\n', 'silver continued to fall. Then the advocates of inflation declared that\\n', 'they would be content with nothing short of free coinage at the ratio of\\n', 'sixteen to one. If the issue had been squarely presented in 1890, there\\n', 'is good reason for believing that free silver would have received a\\n', 'majority in both houses of Congress; but it was not presented.\\n', '\\n', '=The Sherman Silver Purchase Act and the Bond Sales.=--Republican\\n', 'leaders, particularly from the East, stemmed the silver tide by a\\n', 'diversion of forces. They passed the Sherman Act of 1890 providing for\\n', 'large monthly purchases of silver and for the issue of notes redeemable\\n', 'in gold or silver at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury. In\\n', 'a clause of superb ambiguity they announced that it was \"the established\\n', 'policy of the United States to maintain the two metals on a parity with\\n', 'each other upon the present legal ratio or such other ratio as may be\\n', 'provided by law.\" For a while silver was buoyed up. Then it turned once\\n', 'more on its downward course. In the meantime the Treasury was in a sad\\n', 'plight. To maintain the gold reserve, President Cleveland felt compelled\\n', 'to sell government bonds; and to his dismay he found that as soon as the\\n', 'gold was brought in at the front door of the Treasury, notes were\\n', 'presented for redemption and the gold was quickly carried out at the\\n', 'back door. Alarmed at the vicious circle thus created, he urged upon\\n', 'Congress the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. For this he was\\n', 'roundly condemned by many of his own followers who branded his conduct\\n', 'as \"treason to the party\"; but the Republicans, especially from the\\n', 'East, came to his rescue and in 1893 swept the troublesome sections of\\n', 'the law from the statute book. The anger of the silver faction knew no\\n', 'bounds, and the leaders made ready for the approaching presidential\\n', 'campaign.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE PROTECTIVE TARIFF AND TAXATION\\n', '\\n', '=Fluctuation in Tariff Policy.=--As each of the old parties was divided\\n', 'on the currency question, it is not surprising that there was some\\n', 'confusion in their ranks over the tariff. Like the silver issue, the\\n', 'tariff tended to align the manufacturing East against the agricultural\\n', 'West and South rather than to cut directly between the two parties.\\n', 'Still the Republicans on the whole stood firmly by the rates imposed\\n', 'during the Civil War. If we except the reductions of 1872 which were\\n', 'soon offset by increases, we may say that those rates were substantially\\n', 'unchanged for nearly twenty years. When a revision was brought about,\\n', 'however, it was initiated by Republican leaders. Seeing a huge surplus\\n', 'of revenue in the Treasury in 1883, they anticipated popular clamor by\\n', 'revising the tariff on the theory that it ought to be reformed by its\\n', 'friends rather than by its enemies. On the other hand, it was the\\n', 'Republicans also who enacted the McKinley tariff bill of 1890, which\\n', 'carried protection to its highest point up to that time.\\n', '\\n', 'The Democrats on their part were not all confirmed free traders or even\\n', \"advocates of tariff for revenue only. In Cleveland's first\\n\", 'administration they did attack the protective system in the House, where\\n', 'they had a majority, and in this they were vigorously supported by the\\n', 'President. The assault, however, proved to be a futile gesture for it\\n', 'was blocked by the Republicans in the Senate. When, after the sweeping\\n', 'victory of 1892, the Democrats in the House again attempted to bring\\n', 'down the tariff by the Wilson bill of 1894, they were checkmated by\\n', 'their own party colleagues in the upper chamber. In the end they were\\n', 'driven into a compromise that looked more like a McKinley than a Calhoun\\n', 'tariff. The Republicans taunted them with being \"babes in the woods.\"\\n', 'President Cleveland was so dissatisfied with the bill that he refused to\\n', 'sign it, allowing it to become a law, on the lapse of ten days, without\\n', 'his approval.\\n', '\\n', '=The Income Tax of 1894.=--The advocates of tariff reduction usually\\n', 'associated with their proposal a tax on incomes. The argument which\\n', 'they advanced in support of their program was simple. Most of the\\n', 'industries, they said, are in the East and the protective tariff which\\n', 'taxes consumers for the benefit of manufacturers is, in effect, a\\n', 'tribute laid upon the rest of the country. As an offset they offered a\\n', 'tax on large incomes; this owing to the heavy concentration of rich\\n', 'people in the East, would fall mainly upon the beneficiaries of\\n', 'protection. \"We propose,\" said one of them, \"to place a part of the\\n', 'burden upon the accumulated wealth of the country instead of placing it\\n', 'all upon the consumption of the people.\" In this spirit the sponsors of\\n', 'the Wilson tariff bill laid a tax upon all incomes of $4000 a year or\\n', 'more.\\n', '\\n', 'In taking this step, the Democrats encountered opposition in their own\\n', 'party. Senator Hill, of New York, turned fiercely upon them, exclaiming:\\n', '\"The professors with their books, the socialists with their schemes, the\\n', 'anarchists with their bombs are all instructing the people in the ...\\n', 'principles of taxation.\" Even the Eastern Republicans were hardly as\\n', 'savage in their denunciation of the tax. But all this labor was wasted.\\n', 'The next year the Supreme Court of the United States declared the income\\n', 'tax to be a direct tax, and therefore null and void because it was laid\\n', 'on incomes wherever found and not apportioned among the states according\\n', 'to population. The fact that four of the nine judges dissented from this\\n', 'decision was also an index to the diversity of opinion that divided both\\n', 'parties.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE RAILWAYS AND TRUSTS\\n', '\\n', '=The Grangers and State Regulation.=--The same uncertainty about the\\n', 'railways and trusts pervaded the ranks of the Republicans and Democrats.\\n', 'As to the railways, the first firm and consistent demand for their\\n', 'regulation came from the West. There the farmers, in the early\\n', 'seventies, having got control in state legislatures, particularly in\\n', 'Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois, enacted drastic laws prescribing the\\n', 'maximum charges which companies could make for carrying freight and\\n', 'passengers. The application of these measures, however, was limited\\n', 'because the state could not fix the rates for transporting goods and\\n', 'passengers beyond its own borders. The power of regulating interstate\\n', 'commerce, under the Constitution, belonged to Congress.\\n', '\\n', '=The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887.=--Within a few years, the movement\\n', 'which had been so effective in western legislatures appeared at\\n', 'Washington in the form of demands for the federal regulation of\\n', 'interstate rates. In 1887, the pressure became so strong that Congress\\n', 'created the interstate commerce commission and forbade many abuses on\\n', 'the part of railways; such as discriminating in charges between one\\n', 'shipper and another and granting secret rebates to favored persons. This\\n', 'law was a significant beginning; but it left the main question of\\n', 'rate-fixing untouched, much to the discontent of farmers and shippers.\\n', '\\n', '=The Sherman Anti-Trust Law of 1890.=--As in the case of the railways,\\n', 'attacks upon the trusts were first made in state legislatures, where it\\n', 'became the fashion to provide severe penalties for those who formed\\n', 'monopolies and \"conspired to enhance prices.\" Republicans and Democrats\\n', 'united in the promotion of measures of this kind. As in the case of the\\n', 'railways also, the movement to curb the trusts soon had spokesmen at\\n', 'Washington. Though Blaine had declared that \"trusts were largely a\\n', 'private affair with which neither the President nor any private citizen\\n', 'had any particular right to interfere,\" it was a Republican Congress\\n', 'that enacted in 1890 the first measure--the Sherman Anti-Trust\\n', 'Law--directed against great combinations in business. This act declared\\n', 'illegal \"every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise,\\n', 'or conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce among the several\\n', 'states or with foreign nations.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Futility of the Anti-Trust Law.=--Whether the Sherman law was\\n', 'directed against all combinations or merely those which placed an\\n', '\"unreasonable restraint\" on trade and competition was not apparent.\\n', 'Senator Platt of Connecticut, a careful statesman of the old school,\\n', 'averred: \"The questions of whether the bill would be operative, of how\\n', 'it would operate, or whether it was within the power of Congress to\\n', 'enact it, have been whistled down the wind in this Senate as idle talk\\n', \"and the whole effort has been to get some bill headed: 'A bill to punish\\n\", 'trusts,\\' with which to go to the country.\" Whatever its purpose, its\\n', 'effect upon existing trusts and upon the formation of new combinations\\n', 'was negligible. It was practically unenforced by President Harrison and\\n', 'President Cleveland, in spite of the constant demand for harsh action\\n', 'against \"monopolies.\" It was patent that neither the Republicans nor the\\n', 'Democrats were prepared for a war on the trusts to the bitter end.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE MINOR PARTIES AND UNREST\\n', '\\n', '=The Demands of Dissenting Parties.=--From the election of 1872, when\\n', 'Horace Greeley made his ill-fated excursion into politics, onward, there\\n', 'appeared in each presidential campaign one, and sometimes two or more\\n', 'parties, stressing issues that appealed mainly to wage-earners and\\n', 'farmers. Whether they chose to call themselves Labor Reformers,\\n', 'Greenbackers, or Anti-monopolists, their slogans and their platforms all\\n', 'pointed in one direction. Even the Prohibitionists, who in 1872 started\\n', 'on their career with a single issue, the abolition of the liquor\\n', 'traffic, found themselves making declarations of faith on other matters\\n', 'and hopelessly split over the money question in 1896.\\n', '\\n', 'A composite view of the platforms put forth by the dissenting parties\\n', \"from the administration of Grant to the close of Cleveland's second term\\n\", 'reveals certain notions common to them all. These included among many\\n', 'others: the earliest possible payment of the national debt; regulation\\n', 'of the rates of railways and telegraph companies; repeal of the specie\\n', 'resumption act of 1875; the issue of legal tender notes by the\\n', 'government convertible into interest-bearing obligations on demand;\\n', 'unlimited coinage of silver as well as gold; a graduated inheritance\\n', 'tax; legislation to take from \"land, railroad, money, and other gigantic\\n', 'corporate monopolies ... the powers they have so corruptly and unjustly\\n', 'usurped\"; popular or direct election of United States Senators; woman\\n', 'suffrage; and a graduated income tax, \"placing the burden of government\\n', 'on those who can best afford to pay instead of laying it on the farmers\\n', 'and producers.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Criticism of the Old Parties.=--To this long program of measures the\\n', 'reformers added harsh and acrid criticism of the old parties and\\n', 'sometimes, it must be said, of established institutions of government.\\n', '\"We denounce,\" exclaimed the Labor party in 1888, \"the Democratic and\\n', 'Republican parties as hopelessly and shamelessly corrupt and by reason\\n', 'of their affiliation with monopolies equally unworthy of the suffrages\\n', 'of those who do not live upon public plunder.\" \"The United States\\n', 'Senate,\" insisted the Greenbackers, \"is a body composed largely of\\n', 'aristocratic millionaires who according to their own party papers\\n', 'generally purchased their elections in order to protect the great\\n', 'monopolies which they represent.\" Indeed, if their platforms are to be\\n', 'accepted at face value, the Greenbackers believed that the entire\\n', 'government had passed out of the hands of the people.\\n', '\\n', '=The Grangers.=--This unsparing, not to say revolutionary, criticism of\\n', 'American political life, appealed, it seems, mainly to farmers in the\\n', 'Middle West. Always active in politics, they had, before the Civil War,\\n', 'cast their lot as a rule with one or the other of the leading parties.\\n', 'In 1867, however, there grew up among them an association known as the\\n', '\"Patrons of Husbandry,\" which was destined to play a large role in the\\n', 'partisan contests of the succeeding decades. This society, which\\n', 'organized local lodges or \"granges\" on principles of secrecy and\\n', 'fraternity, was originally designed to promote in a general way the\\n', 'interests of the farmers. Its political bearings were apparently not\\n', 'grasped at first by its promoters. Yet, appealing as it did to the most\\n', 'active and independent spirits among the farmers and gathering to itself\\n', 'the strength that always comes from organization, it soon found itself\\n', 'in the hands of leaders more or less involved in politics. Where a few\\n', 'votes are marshaled together in a democracy, there is power.\\n', '\\n', '=The Greenback Party.=--The first extensive activity of the Grangers was\\n', 'connected with the attack on the railways in the Middle West which\\n', 'forced several state legislatures to reduce freight and passenger rates\\n', 'by law. At the same time, some leaders in the movement, no doubt\\n', 'emboldened by this success, launched in 1876 a new political party,\\n', 'popularly known as the Greenbackers, favoring a continued re-issue of\\n', 'the legal tenders. The beginnings were disappointing; but two years\\n', 'later, in the congressional elections, the Greenbackers swept whole\\n', 'sections of the country. Their candidates polled more than a million\\n', 'votes and fourteen of them were returned to the House of\\n', 'Representatives. To all outward signs a new and formidable party had\\n', 'entered the lists.\\n', '\\n', 'The sanguine hopes of the leaders proved to be illusory. The quiet\\n', 'operations of the resumption act the following year, a revival of\\n', 'industry from a severe panic which had set in during 1873, the Silver\\n', 'Purchase Act, and the re-issue of Greenbacks cut away some of the\\n', 'grounds of agitation. There was also a diversion of forces to the silver\\n', 'faction which had a substantial support in the silver mine owners of the\\n', 'West. At all events the Greenback vote fell to about 300,000 in the\\n', 'election of 1880. A still greater drop came four years later and the\\n', 'party gave up the ghost, its sponsors returning to their former\\n', 'allegiance or sulking in their tents.\\n', '\\n', '=The Rise of the Populist Party.=--Those leaders of the old parties who\\n', 'now looked for a happy future unvexed by new factions were doomed to\\n', 'disappointment. The funeral of the Greenback party was hardly over\\n', 'before there arose two other political specters in the agrarian\\n', \"sections: the National Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union,\\n\", \"particularly strong in the South and West; and the Farmers' Alliance,\\n\", 'operating in the North. By 1890 the two orders claimed over three\\n', 'million members. As in the case of the Grangers many years before, the\\n', 'leaders among them found an easy way into politics. In 1892 they held a\\n', 'convention, nominated a candidate for President, and adopted the name of\\n', '\"People\\'s Party,\" from which they were known as Populists. Their\\n', 'platform, in every line, breathed a spirit of radicalism. They declared\\n', 'that \"the newspapers are largely subsidized or muzzled; public opinion\\n', 'silenced; business prostrate; our homes covered with mortgages; and the\\n', 'land concentrating in the hands of capitalists.... The fruits of the\\n', 'toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a\\n', 'few.\" Having delivered this sweeping indictment, the Populists put\\n', 'forward their remedies: the free coinage of silver, a graduated income\\n', 'tax, postal savings banks, and government ownership of railways and\\n', 'telegraphs. At the same time they approved the initiative, referendum,\\n', 'and popular election of Senators, and condemned the use of federal\\n', 'troops in labor disputes. On this platform, the Populists polled over a\\n', 'million votes, captured twenty-two presidential electors, and sent a\\n', 'powerful delegation to Congress.\\n', '\\n', '=Industrial Distress Augments Unrest.=--The four years intervening\\n', 'between the campaign of 1892 and the next presidential election brought\\n', 'forth many events which aggravated the ill-feeling expressed in the\\n', 'portentous platform of Populism. Cleveland, a consistent enemy of free\\n', 'silver, gave his powerful support to the gold standard and insisted on\\n', 'the repeal of the Silver Purchase Act, thus alienating an increasing\\n', 'number of his own party. In 1893 a grave industrial crisis fell upon the\\n', 'land: banks and business houses went into bankruptcy with startling\\n', 'rapidity; factories were closed; idle men thronged the streets hunting\\n', 'for work; and the prices of wheat and corn dropped to a ruinous level.\\n', 'Labor disputes also filled the crowded record. A strike at the Pullman\\n', 'car works in Chicago spread to the railways. Disorders ensued. President\\n', 'Cleveland, against the protests of the governor of Illinois, John P.\\n', 'Altgeld, dispatched troops to the scene of action. The United States\\n', 'district court at Chicago issued an injunction forbidding the president\\n', 'of the Railway Union, Eugene V. Debs, or his assistants to interfere\\n', 'with the transmission of the mails or interstate commerce in any form.\\n', 'For refusing to obey the order, Debs was arrested and imprisoned. With\\n', 'federal troops in possession of the field, with their leader in jail,\\n', 'the strikers gave up the battle, defeated but not subdued. To cap the\\n', 'climax the Supreme Court of the United States, the following year (1895)\\n', 'declared null and void the income tax law just enacted by Congress, thus\\n', 'fanning the flames of Populist discontent all over the West and South.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE SOUND MONEY BATTLE OF 1896\\n', '\\n', '=Conservative Men Alarmed.=--Men of conservative thought and leaning in\\n', 'both parties were by this time thoroughly disturbed. They looked upon\\n', 'the rise of Populism and the growth of labor disputes as the signs of a\\n', 'revolutionary spirit, indeed nothing short of a menace to American\\n', 'institutions and ideals. The income tax law of 1894, exclaimed the\\n', 'distinguished New York advocate, Joseph H. Choate, in an impassioned\\n', 'speech before the Supreme Court, \"is communistic in its purposes and\\n', 'tendencies and is defended here upon principles as communistic,\\n', 'socialistic--what shall I call them--populistic as ever have been\\n', 'addressed to any political assembly in the world.\" Mr. Justice Field in\\n', 'the name of the Court replied: \"The present assault upon capital is but\\n', 'the beginning. It will be but the stepping stone to others larger and\\n', 'more sweeping till our political conditions will become a war of the\\n', 'poor against the rich.\" In declaring the income tax unconstitutional, he\\n', 'believed that he was but averting greater evils lurking under its guise.\\n', 'As for free silver, nearly all conservative men were united in calling\\n', 'it a measure of confiscation and repudiation; an effort of the debtors\\n', 'to pay their obligations with money worth fifty cents on the dollar; the\\n', 'climax of villainies openly defended; a challenge to law, order, and\\n', 'honor.\\n', '\\n', '=The Republicans Come Out for the Gold Standard.=--It was among the\\n', 'Republicans that this opinion was most widely shared and firmly held. It\\n', 'was they who picked up the gauge thrown down by the Populists, though a\\n', 'host of Democrats, like Cleveland and Hill of New York, also battled\\n', 'against the growing Populist defection in Democratic ranks. When the\\n', 'Republican national convention assembled in 1896, the die was soon\\n', 'cast; a declaration of opposition to free silver save by international\\n', 'agreement was carried by a vote of eight to one. The Republican party,\\n', 'to use the vigorous language of Mr. Lodge, arrayed itself against \"not\\n', 'only that organized failure, the Democratic party, but all the wandering\\n', 'forces of political chaos and social disorder ... in these bitter times\\n', 'when the forces of disorder are loose and the wreckers with their false\\n', 'lights gather at the shore to lure the ship of state upon the rocks.\"\\n', 'Yet it is due to historic truth to state that McKinley, whom the\\n', 'Republicans nominated, had voted in Congress for the free coinage of\\n', 'silver, was widely known as a bimetallist, and was only with difficulty\\n', 'persuaded to accept the unequivocal indorsement of the gold standard\\n', 'which was pressed upon him by his counselors. Having accepted it,\\n', 'however, he proved to be a valiant champion, though his major interest\\n', 'was undoubtedly in the protective tariff. To him nothing was more\\n', 'reprehensible than attempts \"to array class against class, \\'the classes\\n', \"against the masses,' section against section, labor against capital,\\n\", '\\'the poor against the rich,\\' or interest against interest.\" Such was the\\n', 'language of his acceptance speech. The whole program of Populism he now\\n', 'viewed as a \"sudden, dangerous, and revolutionary assault upon law and\\n', 'order.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Democratic Convention at Chicago.=--Never, save at the great\\n', 'disruption on the eve of the Civil War, did a Democratic national\\n', 'convention display more feeling than at Chicago in 1896. From the\\n', 'opening prayer to the last motion before the house, every act, every\\n', 'speech, every scene, every resolution evoked passions and sowed\\n', 'dissensions. Departing from long party custom, it voted down in anger a\\n', 'proposal to praise the administration of the Democratic President,\\n', 'Cleveland. When the platform with its radical planks, including free\\n', 'silver, was reported, a veritable storm broke. Senator Hill, trembling\\n', 'with emotion, protested against the departure from old tests of\\n', 'Democratic allegiance; against principles that must drive out of the\\n', 'party men who had grown gray in its service; against revolutionary,\\n', 'unwise, and unprecedented steps in the history of the party. Senator\\n', 'Vilas of Wisconsin, in great fervor, avowed that there was no difference\\n', 'in principle between the free coinage of silver--\"the confiscation of\\n', 'one-half of the credits of the nation for the benefit of debtors\"--and\\n', 'communism itself--\"a universal distribution of property.\" In the triumph\\n', 'of that cause he saw the beginning of \"the overthrow of all law, all\\n', 'justice, all security and repose in the social order.\"\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'WILLIAM J. BRYAN IN 1898]\\n', '\\n', '=The Crown of Thorns Speech.=--The champions of free silver replied in\\n', 'strident tones. They accused the gold advocates of being the aggressors\\n', 'who had assailed the labor and the homes of the people. William Jennings\\n', 'Bryan, of Nebraska, voiced their sentiments in a memorable oration. He\\n', 'declared that their cause \"was as holy as the cause of liberty--the\\n', 'cause of humanity.\" He exclaimed that the contest was between the idle\\n', 'holders of idle capital and the toiling millions. Then he named those\\n', 'for whom he spoke--the wage-earner, the country lawyer, the small\\n', 'merchant, the farmer, and the miner. \"The man who is employed for wages\\n', 'is as much a business man as his employer. The attorney in a country\\n', 'town is as much a business man as the corporation counsel in a great\\n', 'metropolis. The merchant at the cross roads store is as much a business\\n', 'man as the merchant of New York. The farmer ... is as much a business\\n', 'man as the man who goes upon the board of trade and bets upon the price\\n', 'of grain. The miners who go a thousand feet into the earth or climb two\\n', 'thousand feet upon the cliffs ... are as much business men as the few\\n', 'financial magnates who in a back room corner the money of the world....\\n', 'It is for these that we speak. We do not come as aggressors. Ours is not\\n', 'a war of conquest. We are fighting in defense of our homes, our\\n', 'families, and our posterity. We have petitioned and our petitions have\\n', 'been scorned. We have entreated and our entreaties have been\\n', 'disregarded. We have begged and they have mocked when our calamity came.\\n', 'We beg no longer; we entreat no more; we petition no more. We defy\\n', 'them.... We shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to\\n', \"them, 'You shall not press upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns.\\n\", 'You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\\'\"\\n', '\\n', '=Bryan Nominated.=--In all the history of national conventions never had\\n', 'an orator so completely swayed a multitude; not even Yancey in his\\n', 'memorable plea in the Charleston convention of 1860 when, with grave and\\n', 'moving eloquence, he espoused the Southern cause against the impending\\n', 'fates. The delegates, after cheering Mr. Bryan until they could cheer no\\n', 'more, tore the standards from the floor and gathered around the Nebraska\\n', 'delegation to renew the deafening applause. The platform as reported was\\n', 'carried by a vote of two to one and the young orator from the West,\\n', \"hailed as America's Tiberius Gracchus, was nominated as the Democratic\\n\", 'candidate for President. The South and West had triumphed over the East.\\n', 'The division was sectional, admittedly sectional--the old combination of\\n', 'power which Calhoun had so anxiously labored to build up a century\\n', 'earlier. The Gold Democrats were repudiated in terms which were clear to\\n', 'all. A few, unable to endure the thought of voting the Republican\\n', 'ticket, held a convention at Indianapolis where, with the sanction of\\n', 'Cleveland, they nominated candidates of their own and endorsed the gold\\n', 'standard in a forlorn hope.\\n', '\\n', '=The Democratic Platform.=--It was to the call from Chicago that the\\n', 'Democrats gave heed and the Republicans made answer. The platform on\\n', 'which Mr. Bryan stood, unlike most party manifestoes, was explicit in\\n', 'its language and its appeal. It denounced the practice of allowing\\n', 'national banks to issue notes intended to circulate as money on the\\n', 'ground that it was \"in derogation of the Constitution,\" recalling\\n', \"Jackson's famous attack on the Bank in 1832. It declared that tariff\\n\", 'duties should be laid \"for the purpose of revenue\"--Calhoun\\'s doctrine.\\n', 'In demanding the free coinage of silver, it recurred to the practice\\n', 'abandoned in 1873. The income tax came next on the program. The platform\\n', 'alleged that the law of 1894, passed by a Democratic Congress, was \"in\\n', 'strict pursuance of the uniform decisions of the Supreme Court for\\n', 'nearly a hundred years,\" and then hinted that the decision annulling the\\n', 'law might be reversed by the same body \"as it may hereafter be\\n', 'constituted.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The appeal to labor voiced by Mr. Bryan in his \"crown of thorns\" speech\\n', 'was reinforced in the platform. \"As labor creates the wealth of the\\n', 'country,\" ran one plank, \"we demand the passage of such laws as may be\\n', 'necessary to protect it in all its rights.\" Referring to the recent\\n', 'Pullman strike, the passions of which had not yet died away, the\\n', 'platform denounced \"arbitrary interference by federal authorities in\\n', 'local affairs as a violation of the Constitution of the United States\\n', 'and a crime against free institutions.\" A special objection was lodged\\n', 'against \"government by injunction as a new and highly dangerous form of\\n', 'oppression by which federal judges, in contempt of the laws of states\\n', 'and rights of citizens, become at once legislators, judges, and\\n', 'executioners.\" The remedy advanced was a federal law assuring trial by\\n', 'jury in all cases of contempt in labor disputes. Having made this\\n', 'declaration of faith, the Democrats, with Mr. Bryan at the head, raised\\n', 'their standard of battle.\\n', '\\n', '=The Heated Campaign.=--The campaign which ensued outrivaled in the\\n', 'range of its educational activities and the bitterness of its tone all\\n', 'other political conflicts in American history, not excepting the fateful\\n', 'struggle of 1860. Immense sums of money were contributed to the funds of\\n', 'both parties. Railway, banking, and other corporations gave generously\\n', 'to the Republicans; the silver miners, less lavishly but with the same\\n', 'anxiety, supported the Democrats. The country was flooded with\\n', 'pamphlets, posters, and handbills. Every public forum, from the great\\n', 'auditoriums of the cities to the \"red schoolhouses\" on the countryside,\\n', 'was occupied by the opposing forces.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Bryan took the stump himself, visiting all parts of the country in\\n', 'special trains and addressing literally millions of people in the open\\n', 'air. Mr. McKinley chose the older and more formal plan. He received\\n', 'delegations at his home in Canton and discussed the issues of the\\n', 'campaign from his front porch, leaving to an army of well-organized\\n', 'orators the task of reaching the people in their home towns. Parades,\\n', 'processions, and monster demonstrations filled the land with politics.\\n', 'Whole states were polled in advance by the Republicans and the doubtful\\n', 'voters personally visited by men equipped with arguments and literature.\\n', 'Manufacturers, frightened at the possibility of disordered public\\n', 'credit, announced that they would close their doors if the Democrats won\\n', 'the election. Men were dismissed from public and private places on\\n', 'account of their political views, one eminent college president being\\n', 'forced out for advocating free silver. The language employed by\\n', 'impassioned and embittered speakers on both sides roused the public to a\\n', 'state of frenzy, once more showing the lengths to which men could go in\\n', 'personal and political abuse.\\n', '\\n', '=The Republican Victory.=--The verdict of the nation was decisive.\\n', 'McKinley received 271 of the 447 electoral votes, and 7,111,000 popular\\n', \"votes as against Bryan's 6,509,000. The congressional elections were\\n\", 'equally positive although, on account of the composition of the Senate,\\n', 'the \"hold-over\" Democrats and Populists still enjoyed a power out of\\n', 'proportion to their strength as measured at the polls. Even as it was,\\n', 'the Republicans got full control of both houses--a dominion of the\\n', 'entire government which they were to hold for fourteen years--until the\\n', \"second half of Mr. Taft's administration, when they lost possession of\\n\", 'the House of Representatives. The yoke of indecision was broken. The\\n', 'party of sound finance and protective tariffs set out upon its lease of\\n', 'power with untroubled assurance.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'REPUBLICAN MEASURES AND RESULTS\\n', '\\n', '=The Gold Standard and the Tariff.=--Yet strange as it may seem, the\\n', 'Republicans did not at once enact legislation making the gold dollar the\\n', 'standard for the national currency. Not until 1900 did they take that\\n', 'positive step. In his first inaugural President McKinley, as if still\\n', 'uncertain in his own mind or fearing a revival of the contest just\\n', 'closed, placed the tariff, not the money question, in the forefront.\\n', '\"The people have decided,\" he said, \"that such legislation should be had\\n', 'as will give ample protection and encouragement to the industries and\\n', 'development of our country.\" Protection for American industries,\\n', 'therefore, he urged, is the task before Congress. \"With adequate revenue\\n', 'secured, but not until then, we can enter upon changes in our fiscal\\n', 'laws.\" As the Republicans had only forty-six of the ninety Senators, and\\n', 'at least four of them were known advocates of free silver, the\\n', 'discretion exercised by the President in selecting the tariff for\\n', 'congressional debate was the better part of valor.\\n', '\\n', 'Congress gave heed to the warning. Under the direction of Nelson P.\\n', 'Dingley, whose name was given to the bill, a tariff measure levying the\\n', 'highest rates yet laid in the history of American imposts was prepared\\n', 'and driven through the House of Representatives. The opposition\\n', 'encountered in the Senate, especially from the West, was overcome by\\n', 'concessions in favor of that section; but the duties on sugar, tin,\\n', 'steel, lumber, hemp, and in fact all of the essential commodities\\n', 'handled by combinations and trusts, were materially raised.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'PRESIDENT MCKINLEY AND HIS CABINET]\\n', '\\n', '=Growth of Combinations.=--The years that followed the enactment of the\\n', 'Dingley law were, whatever the cause, the most prosperous the country\\n', 'had witnessed for many a decade. Industries of every kind were soon\\n', 'running full blast; labor was employed; commerce spread more swiftly\\n', 'than ever to the markets of the world. Coincident with this progress was\\n', 'the organization of the greatest combinations and trusts the world had\\n', 'yet seen. In 1899 the smelters formed a trust with a capital of\\n', '$65,000,000; in the same year the Standard Oil Company with a capital of\\n', 'over one hundred millions took the place of the old trust; and the\\n', 'Copper Trust was incorporated under the laws of New Jersey, its par\\n', 'value capital being fixed shortly afterward at $175,000,000. A year\\n', 'later the National Sugar Refining Company, of New Jersey, started with a\\n', 'capital of $90,000,000, adopting the policy of issuing to the\\n', 'stockholders no public statement of its earnings or financial condition.\\n', 'Before another twelvemonth had elapsed all previous corporate financing\\n', 'was reduced to small proportions by the flotation of the United States\\n', 'Steel Corporation with a capital of more than a billion dollars, an\\n', 'enterprise set in motion by the famous Morgan banking house of New York.\\n', '\\n', 'In nearly all these gigantic undertakings, the same great leaders in\\n', 'finance were more or less intimately associated. To use the language of\\n', 'an eminent authority: \"They are all allied and intertwined by their\\n', 'various mutual interests. For instance, the Pennsylvania Railroad\\n', 'interests are on the one hand allied with the Vanderbilts and on the\\n', 'other with the Rockefellers. The Vanderbilts are closely allied with the\\n', 'Morgan group.... Viewed as a whole we find the dominating influences in\\n', 'the trusts to be made up of a network of large and small capitalists,\\n', 'many allied to one another by ties of more or less importance, but all\\n', 'being appendages to or parts of the greater groups which are themselves\\n', 'dependent on and allied with the two mammoth or Rockefeller and Morgan\\n', 'groups. These two mammoth groups jointly ... constitute the heart of the\\n', 'business and commercial life of the nation.\" Such was the picture of\\n', 'triumphant business enterprise drawn by a financier within a few years\\n', 'after the memorable campaign of 1896.\\n', '\\n', 'America had become one of the first workshops of the world. It was, by\\n', 'virtue of the closely knit organization of its business and finance, one\\n', 'of the most powerful and energetic leaders in the struggle of the giants\\n', 'for the business of the earth. The capital of the Steel Corporation\\n', 'alone was more than ten times the total national debt which the apostles\\n', 'of calamity in the days of Washington and Hamilton declared the nation\\n', 'could never pay.

Perhaps at this late day, it is useless to\\n', 'protest against the currency of the idea. Nevertheless, the truth is\\n', 'that from the fateful moment in March, 1775, when Edmund Burke unfolded\\n', 'to his colleagues in the British Parliament the resources of an\\n', 'invincible America, down to the settlement at Versailles in 1919 closing\\n', 'the drama of the World War, this nation has been a world power,\\n', 'influencing by its example, by its institutions, by its wealth, trade,\\n', 'and arms the course of international affairs. And it should be said also\\n', 'that neither in the field of commercial enterprise nor in that of\\n', 'diplomacy has it been wanting in spirit or ingenuity.\\n', '\\n', 'When John Hay, Secretary of State, heard that an American citizen,\\n', 'Perdicaris, had been seized by Raisuli, a Moroccan bandit, in 1904, he\\n', 'wired his brusque message: \"We want Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead.\"\\n', \"This was but an echo of Commodore Decatur's equally characteristic\\n\", 'answer, \"Not a minute,\" given nearly a hundred years before to the\\n', 'pirates of Algiers begging for time to consider whether they would cease\\n', 'preying upon American merchantmen.

Was it not almost half a century before\\n', 'the battle of Manila Bay in 1898, that Commodore Perry with an adequate\\n', 'naval force \"gently coerced Japan into friendship with us,\" leading all\\n', 'the nations of the earth in the opening of that empire to the trade of\\n', 'the Occident?

Only a\\n', 'little while after the civil conflict came to a close, it was called\\n', 'upon to deal with a dangerous situation created in Mexico by the\\n', 'ambitions of Napoleon III. During the administration of Buchanan, Mexico\\n', 'had fallen into disorder through the strife of the Liberal and the\\n', 'Clerical parties; the President asked for authority to use American\\n', 'troops to bring to a peaceful haven \"a wreck upon the ocean, drifting\\n', 'about as she is impelled by different factions.\" Our own domestic crisis\\n', 'then intervened.\\n', '\\n', 'Observing the United States heavily involved in its own problems, the\\n', 'great powers, England, France, and Spain, decided in the autumn of 1861\\n', 'to take a hand themselves in restoring order in Mexico. They entered\\n', 'into an agreement to enforce the claims of their citizens against Mexico\\n', 'and to protect their subjects residing in that republic. They invited\\n', 'the United States to join them, and, on meeting a polite refusal, they\\n', 'prepared for a combined military and naval demonstration on their own\\n', 'account. In the midst of this action England and Spain, discovering the\\n', 'sinister purposes of Napoleon, withdrew their troops and left the field\\n', 'to him.\\n', '\\n', 'The French Emperor, it was well known, looked with jealousy upon the\\n', 'growth of the United States and dreamed of establishing in the Western\\n', 'hemisphere an imperial power to offset the American republic.\\n', 'Intervention to collect debts was only a cloak for his deeper designs.\\n', 'Throwing off that guise in due time, he made the Archduke Maximilian, a\\n', 'brother of the ruler of Austria, emperor in Mexico, and surrounded his\\n', 'throne by French soldiers, in spite of all protests.\\n', '\\n', 'This insolent attack upon the Mexican republic, deeply resented in the\\n', 'United States, was allowed to drift in its course until 1865. At that\\n', 'juncture General Sheridan was dispatched to the Mexican border with a\\n', 'large armed force; General Grant urged the use of the American army to\\n', 'expel the French from this continent. The Secretary of State, Seward,\\n', 'counseled negotiation first, and, applying the Monroe Doctrine, was able\\n', 'to prevail upon Napoleon III to withdraw his troops. Without the support\\n', 'of French arms, the sham empire in Mexico collapsed like a house of\\n', 'cards and the unhappy Maximilian, the victim of French ambition and\\n', 'intrigue, met his death at the hands of a Mexican firing squad.\\n', '\\n', '=Alaska Purchased.=--The Mexican affair had not been brought to a close\\n', 'before the Department of State was busy with negotiations which resulted\\n', 'in the purchase of Alaska from Russia. The treaty of cession, signed on\\n', 'March 30, 1867, added to the United States a domain of nearly six\\n', 'hundred thousand square miles, a territory larger than Texas and nearly\\n', 'three-fourths the size of the Louisiana purchase. Though it was a\\n', 'distant colony separated from our continental domain by a thousand miles\\n', 'of water, no question of \"imperialism\" or \"colonization foreign to\\n', 'American doctrines\" seems to have been raised at the time. The treaty\\n', 'was ratified promptly by the Senate. The purchase price, $7,200,000, was\\n', 'voted by the House of Representatives after the display of some\\n', 'resentment against a system that compelled it to appropriate money to\\n', 'fulfill an obligation which it had no part in making. Seward, who\\n', 'formulated the treaty, rejoiced, as he afterwards said, that he had kept\\n', 'Alaska out of the hands of England.\\n', '\\n', '=American Interest in the Caribbean.=--Having achieved this diplomatic\\n', 'triumph, Seward turned to the increase of American power in another\\n', 'direction. He negotiated, with Denmark, a treaty providing for the\\n', 'purchase of the islands of St. John and St. Thomas in the West Indies,\\n', 'strategic points in the Caribbean for sea power. This project, long\\n', 'afterward brought to fruition by other men, was defeated on this\\n', 'occasion by the refusal of the Senate to ratify the treaty. Evidently it\\n', 'was not yet prepared to exercise colonial dominion over other races.\\n', '\\n', 'Undaunted by the misadventure in Caribbean policies, President Grant\\n', 'warmly advocated the acquisition of Santo Domingo. This little republic\\n', 'had long been in a state of general disorder. In 1869 a treaty of\\n', 'annexation was concluded with its president. The document Grant\\n', 'transmitted to the Senate with his cordial approval, only to have it\\n', 'rejected. Not at all changed in his opinion by the outcome of his\\n', 'effort, he continued to urge the subject of annexation. Even in his last\\n', 'message to Congress he referred to it, saying that time had only proved\\n', 'the wisdom of his early course. The addition of Santo Domingo to the\\n', 'American sphere of protection was the work of a later generation. The\\n', 'State Department, temporarily checked, had to bide its time.\\n', '\\n', '=The _Alabama_ Claims Arbitrated.=--Indeed, it had in hand a far more\\n', 'serious matter, a vexing issue that grew out of Civil War diplomacy. The\\n', 'British government, as already pointed out in other connections, had\\n', 'permitted Confederate cruisers, including the famous _Alabama_, built in\\n', 'British ports, to escape and prey upon the commerce of the Northern\\n', 'states. This action, denounced at the time by our government as a grave\\n', 'breach of neutrality as well as a grievous injury to American citizens,\\n', 'led first to remonstrances and finally to repeated claims for damages\\n', 'done to American ships and goods. For a long time Great Britain was\\n', 'firm. Her foreign secretary denied all obligations in the premises,\\n', 'adding somewhat curtly that \"he wished to say once for all that Her\\n', \"Majesty's government disclaimed any responsibility for the losses and\\n\", 'hoped that they had made their position perfectly clear.\" Still\\n', 'President Grant was not persuaded that the door of diplomacy, though\\n', 'closed, was barred. Hamilton Fish, his Secretary of State, renewed the\\n', 'demand. Finally he secured from the British government in 1871 the\\n', 'treaty of Washington providing for the arbitration not merely of the\\n', '_Alabama_ and other claims but also all points of serious controversy\\n', 'between the two countries.\\n', '\\n', 'The tribunal of arbitration thus authorized sat at Geneva in\\n', 'Switzerland, and after a long and careful review of the arguments on\\n', 'both sides awarded to the United States the lump sum of $15,500,000 to\\n', 'be distributed among the American claimants. The damages thus allowed\\n', 'were large, unquestionably larger than strict justice required and it is\\n', 'not surprising that the decision excited much adverse comment in\\n', 'England. Nevertheless, the prompt payment by the British government\\n', 'swept away at once a great cloud of ill-feeling in America. Moreover,\\n', 'the spectacle of two powerful nations choosing the way of peaceful\\n', 'arbitration to settle an angry dispute seemed a happy, if illusory, omen\\n', 'of a modern method for avoiding the arbitrament of war.\\n', '\\n', '=Samoa.=--If the Senate had its doubts at first about the wisdom of\\n', 'acquiring strategic points for naval power in distant seas, the same\\n', 'could not be said of the State Department or naval officers. In 1872\\n', 'Commander Meade, of the United States navy, alive to the importance of\\n', 'coaling stations even in mid-ocean, made a commercial agreement with the\\n', 'chief of Tutuila, one of the Samoan Islands, far below the equator, in\\n', 'the southern Pacific, nearer to Australia than to California. This\\n', 'agreement, providing among other things for our use of the harbor of\\n', 'Pago Pago as a naval base, was six years later changed into a formal\\n', 'treaty ratified by the Senate.\\n', '\\n', 'Such enterprise could not escape the vigilant eyes of England and\\n', 'Germany, both mindful of the course of the sea power in history. The\\n', 'German emperor, seizing as a pretext a quarrel between his consul in the\\n', 'islands and a native king, laid claim to an interest in the Samoan\\n', 'group. England, aware of the dangers arising from German outposts in the\\n', 'southern seas so near to Australia, was not content to stand aside. So\\n', 'it happened that all three countries sent battleships to the Samoan\\n', 'waters, threatening a crisis that was fortunately averted by friendly\\n', 'settlement. If, as is alleged, Germany entertained a notion of\\n', 'challenging American sea power then and there, the presence of British\\n', 'ships must have dispelled that dream.\\n', '\\n', 'The result of the affair was a tripartite agreement by which the three\\n', 'powers in 1889 undertook a protectorate over the islands. But joint\\n', 'control proved unsatisfactory. There was constant friction between the\\n', 'Germans and the English. The spheres of authority being vague and open\\n', 'to dispute, the plan had to be abandoned at the end of ten years.\\n', 'England withdrew altogether, leaving to Germany all the islands except\\n', 'Tutuila, which was ceded outright to the United States. Thus one of the\\n', 'finest harbors in the Pacific, to the intense delight of the American\\n', 'navy, passed permanently under American dominion. Another triumph in\\n', 'diplomacy was set down to the credit of the State Department.\\n', '\\n', '=Cleveland and the Venezuela Affair.=--In the relations with South\\n', 'America, as well as in those with the distant Pacific, the diplomacy of\\n', 'the government at Washington was put to the test. For some time it had\\n', 'been watching a dispute between England and Venezuela over the western\\n', 'boundary of British Guiana and, on an appeal from Venezuela, it had\\n', 'taken a lively interest in the contest. In 1895 President Cleveland saw\\n', 'that Great Britain would yield none of her claims. After hearing the\\n', 'arguments of Venezuela, his Secretary of State, Richard T. Olney, in a\\n', 'note none too conciliatory, asked the British government whether it was\\n', 'willing to arbitrate the points in controversy. This inquiry he\\n', 'accompanied by a warning to the effect that the United States could not\\n', 'permit any European power to contest its mastery in this hemisphere.\\n', '\"The United States,\" said the Secretary, \"is practically sovereign on\\n', 'this continent and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it\\n', 'confines its interposition.... Its infinite resources, combined with its\\n', 'isolated position, render it master of the situation and practically\\n', 'invulnerable against any or all other powers.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The reply evoked from the British government by this strong statement\\n', 'was firm and clear. The Monroe Doctrine, it said, even if not so widely\\n', 'stretched by interpretation, was not binding in international law; the\\n', 'dispute with Venezuela was a matter of interest merely to the parties\\n', 'involved; and arbitration of the question was impossible. This response\\n', \"called forth President Cleveland's startling message of 1895. He asked\\n\", 'Congress to create a commission authorized to ascertain by researches\\n', 'the true boundary between Venezuela and British Guiana. He added that it\\n', 'would be the duty of this country \"to resist by every means in its\\n', 'power, as a willful aggression upon its rights and interests, the\\n', 'appropriation by Great Britain of any lands or the exercise of\\n', 'governmental jurisdiction over any territory which, after investigation,\\n', 'we have determined of right belongs to Venezuela.\" The serious character\\n', 'of this statement he thoroughly understood. He declared that he was\\n', 'conscious of his responsibilities, intimating that war, much as it was\\n', 'to be deplored, was not comparable to \"a supine submission to wrong and\\n', 'injustice and the consequent loss of national self-respect and honor.\"\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: GROVER CLEVELAND]\\n', '\\n', 'The note of defiance which ran through this message, greeted by shrill\\n', 'cries of enthusiasm in many circles, was viewed in other quarters as a\\n', 'portent of war. Responsible newspapers in both countries spoke of an\\n', 'armed settlement of the dispute as inevitable. Congress created the\\n', 'commission and appropriated money for the investigation; a body of\\n', 'learned men was appointed to determine the merits of the conflicting\\n', 'boundary claims. The British government, deaf to the clamor of the\\n', 'bellicose section of the London press, deplored the incident,\\n', 'courteously replied in the affirmative to a request for assistance in\\n', 'the search for evidence, and finally agreed to the proposition that the\\n', 'issue be submitted to arbitration. The outcome of this somewhat perilous\\n', 'dispute contributed not a little to Cleveland\\'s reputation as \"a\\n', 'sterling representative of the true American spirit.\" This was not\\n', 'diminished when the tribunal of arbitration found that Great Britain was\\n', 'on the whole right in her territorial claims against Venezuela.\\n', '\\n', '=The Annexation of Hawaii.=--While engaged in the dangerous Venezuela\\n', 'controversy, President Cleveland was compelled by a strange turn in\\n', 'events to consider the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands in the\\n', 'mid-Pacific. For more than half a century American missionaries had been\\n', 'active in converting the natives to the Christian faith and enterprising\\n', 'American business men had been developing the fertile sugar plantations.\\n', 'Both the Department of State and the Navy Department were fully\\n', 'conscious of the strategic relation of the islands to the growth of sea\\n', 'power and watched with anxiety any developments likely to bring them\\n', 'under some other Dominion.\\n', '\\n', 'The country at large was indifferent, however, until 1893, when a\\n', 'revolution, headed by Americans, broke out, ending in the overthrow of\\n', 'the native government, the abolition of the primitive monarchy, and the\\n', 'retirement of Queen Liliuokalani to private life. This crisis, a\\n', 'repetition of the Texas affair in a small theater, was immediately\\n', 'followed by a demand from the new Hawaiian government for annexation to\\n', 'the United States. President Harrison looked with favor on the proposal,\\n', 'negotiated the treaty of annexation, and laid it before the Senate for\\n', 'approval. There it still rested when his term of office was brought to a\\n', 'close.\\n', '\\n', \"Harrison's successor, Cleveland, it was well known, had doubts about the\\n\", 'propriety of American action in Hawaii. For the purpose of making an\\n', 'inquiry into the matter, he sent a special commissioner to the islands.\\n', 'On the basis of the report of his agent, Cleveland came to the\\n', 'conclusion that \"the revolution in the island kingdom had been\\n', 'accomplished by the improper use of the armed forces of the United\\n', 'States and that the wrong should be righted by a restoration of the\\n', 'queen to her throne.\" Such being his matured conviction, though the\\n', 'facts upon which he rested it were warmly controverted, he could do\\n', 'nothing but withdraw the treaty from the Senate and close the incident.\\n', '\\n', 'To the Republicans this sharp and cavalier disposal of their plans,\\n', 'carried out in a way that impugned the motives of a Republican\\n', 'President, was nothing less than \"a betrayal of American interests.\" In\\n', 'their platform of 1896 they made clear their position: \"Our foreign\\n', 'policy should be at all times firm, vigorous, and dignified and all our\\n', 'interests in the Western hemisphere carefully watched and guarded. The\\n', 'Hawaiian Islands should be controlled by the United States and no\\n', 'foreign power should be permitted to interfere with them.\" There was no\\n', 'mistaking this view of the issue. As the vote in the election gave\\n', 'popular sanction to Republican policies, Congress by a joint resolution,\\n', 'passed on July 6, 1898, annexed the islands to the United States and\\n', 'later conferred upon them the ordinary territorial form of government.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CUBA AND THE SPANISH WAR\\n', '\\n', '=Early American Relations with Cuba.=--The year that brought Hawaii\\n', 'finally under the American flag likewise drew to a conclusion another\\n', 'long controversy over a similar outpost in the Atlantic, one of the last\\n', 'remnants of the once glorious Spanish empire--the island of Cuba.\\n', '\\n', 'For a century the Department of State had kept an anxious eye upon this\\n', 'base of power, knowing full well that both France and England, already\\n', 'well established in the West Indies, had their attention also fixed upon\\n', 'Cuba. In the administration of President Fillmore they had united in\\n', 'proposing to the United States a tripartite treaty guaranteeing Spain in\\n', 'her none too certain ownership. This proposal, squarely rejected,\\n', 'furnished the occasion for a statement of American policy which stood\\n', 'the test of all the years that followed; namely, that the affair was one\\n', 'between Spain and the United States alone.\\n', '\\n', 'In that long contest in the United States for the balance of power\\n', 'between the North and South, leaders in the latter section often thought\\n', 'of bringing Cuba into the union to offset the free states. An\\n', 'opportunity to announce their purposes publicly was afforded in 1854 by\\n', 'a controversy over the seizure of an American ship by Cuban authorities.\\n', 'On that occasion three American ministers abroad, stationed at Madrid,\\n', 'Paris, and London respectively, held a conference and issued the\\n', 'celebrated \"Ostend Manifesto.\" They united in declaring that Cuba, by\\n', 'her geographical position, formed a part of the United States, that\\n', 'possession by a foreign power was inimical to American interests, and\\n', 'that an effort should be made to purchase the island from Spain. In case\\n', 'the owner refused to sell, they concluded, with a menacing flourish, \"by\\n', 'every law, human and divine, we shall be justified in wresting it from\\n', 'Spain if we possess the power.\" This startling proclamation to the world\\n', 'was promptly disowned by the United States government.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _=An old cartoon.=_\\n', '\\n', 'A SIGHT TOO BAD\\n', '\\n', '_Struggling Cuba._ \"You must be awfully near-sighted, Mr. President, not\\n', 'to recognize me.\" _U.S.G._ \"No, I am far-sighted: for I can recognize\\n', 'France.\"]\\n', '\\n', '=Revolutions in Cuba.=--For nearly twenty years afterwards the Cuban\\n', 'question rested. Then it was revived in another form during President\\n', \"Grant's administrations, when the natives became engaged in a\\n\", 'destructive revolt against Spanish officials. For ten years--1868-78--a\\n', 'guerrilla warfare raged in the island. American citizens, by virtue of\\n', 'their ancient traditions of democracy, naturally sympathized with a war\\n', 'for independence and self-government. Expeditions to help the insurgents\\n', 'were fitted out secretly in American ports. Arms and supplies were\\n', 'smuggled into Cuba. American soldiers of fortune joined their ranks. The\\n', 'enforcement of neutrality against the friends of Cuban independence, no\\n', 'pleasing task for a sympathetic President, the protection of American\\n', 'lives and property in the revolutionary area, and similar matters kept\\n', 'our government busy with Cuba for a whole decade.\\n', '\\n', 'A brief lull in Cuban disorders was followed in 1895 by a renewal of the\\n', 'revolutionary movement. The contest between the rebels and the Spanish\\n', 'troops, marked by extreme cruelty and a total disregard for life and\\n', 'property, exceeded all bounds of decency, and once more raised the old\\n', \"questions that had tormented Grant's administration. Gomez, the leader\\n\", 'of the revolt, intent upon provoking American interference, laid waste\\n', 'the land with fire and sword. By a proclamation of November 6, 1895, he\\n', 'ordered the destruction of sugar plantations and railway connections and\\n', 'the closure of all sugar factories. The work of ruin was completed by\\n', 'the ruthless Spanish general, Weyler, who concentrated the inhabitants\\n', 'from rural regions into military camps, where they died by the hundreds\\n', 'of disease and starvation. Stories of the atrocities, bad enough in\\n', 'simple form, became lurid when transmuted into American news and deeply\\n', 'moved the sympathies of the American people. Sermons were preached about\\n', 'Spanish misdeeds; orators demanded that the Cubans be sustained \"in\\n', 'their heroic struggle for independence\"; newspapers, scouting the\\n', 'ordinary forms of diplomatic negotiation, spurned mediation and demanded\\n', 'intervention and war if necessary.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'CUBAN REVOLUTIONISTS]\\n', '\\n', \"=President Cleveland's Policy.=--Cleveland chose the way of peace. He\\n\", 'ordered the observance of the rule of neutrality. He declined to act on\\n', 'a resolution of Congress in favor of giving to the Cubans the rights of\\n', 'belligerents. Anxious to bring order to the distracted island, he\\n', 'tendered to Spain the good offices of the United States as mediator in\\n', 'the contest--a tender rejected by the Spanish government with the broad\\n', 'hint that President Cleveland might be more vigorous in putting a stop\\n', 'to the unlawful aid in money, arms, and supplies, afforded to the\\n', 'insurgents by American sympathizers. Thereupon the President returned to\\n', 'the course he had marked out for himself, leaving \"the public nuisance\"\\n', 'to his successor, President McKinley.\\n', '\\n', '=Republican Policies.=--The Republicans in 1897 found themselves in a\\n', 'position to employ that \"firm, vigorous, and dignified\" foreign policy\\n', 'which they had approved in their platform. They had declared: \"The\\n', 'government of Spain having lost control of Cuba and being unable to\\n', '\\n', 'protect the property or lives of resident American citizens or to comply\\n', 'with its treaty obligations, we believe that the government of the\\n', 'United States should actively use its influence and good offices to\\n', 'restore peace and give independence to the island.\" The American\\n', 'property in Cuba to which the Republicans referred in their platform\\n', 'amounted by this time to more than fifty million dollars; the commerce\\n', 'with the island reached more than one hundred millions annually; and the\\n', 'claims of American citizens against Spain for property destroyed totaled\\n', 'sixteen millions. To the pleas of humanity which made such an effective\\n', 'appeal to the hearts of the American people, there were thus added\\n', 'practical considerations of great weight.\\n', '\\n', '=President McKinley Negotiates.=--In the face of the swelling tide of\\n', 'popular opinion in favor of quick, drastic, and positive action,\\n', 'McKinley chose first the way of diplomacy. A short time after his\\n', 'inauguration he lodged with the Spanish government a dignified protest\\n', 'against its policies in Cuba, thus opening a game of thrust and parry\\n', 'with the suave ministers at Madrid. The results of the exchange of\\n', 'notes were the recall of the obnoxious General Weyler, the appointment\\n', 'of a governor-general less bloodthirsty in his methods, a change in the\\n', 'policy of concentrating civilians in military camps, and finally a\\n', 'promise of \"home rule\" for Cuba. There is no doubt that the Spanish\\n', 'government was eager to avoid a war that could have but one outcome. The\\n', 'American minister at Madrid, General Woodford, was convinced that firm\\n', 'and patient pressure would have resulted in the final surrender of Cuba\\n', 'by the Spanish government.\\n', '\\n', '=The De Lome and the _Maine_ Incidents.=--Such a policy was defeated by\\n', 'events. In February, 1898, a private letter written by Senor de Lome,\\n', 'the Spanish ambassador at Washington, expressing contempt for the\\n', 'President of the United States, was filched from the mails and passed\\n', 'into the hands of a journalist, William R. Hearst, who published it to\\n', 'the world. In the excited state of American opinion, few gave heed to\\n', 'the grave breach of diplomatic courtesy committed by breaking open\\n', 'private correspondence. The Spanish government was compelled to recall\\n', 'De Lome, thus officially condemning his conduct.\\n', '\\n', 'At this point a far more serious crisis put the pacific relations of the\\n', 'two negotiating countries in dire peril. On February 15, the battleship\\n', '_Maine_, riding in the harbor of Havana, was blown up and sunk, carrying\\n', 'to death two officers and two hundred and fifty-eight members of the\\n', 'crew. This tragedy, ascribed by the American public to the malevolence\\n', 'of Spanish officials, profoundly stirred an already furious nation.\\n', 'When, on March 21, a commission of inquiry reported that the ill-fated\\n', 'ship had been blown up by a submarine mine which had in turn set off\\n', \"some of the ship's magazines, the worst suspicions seemed confirmed. If\\n\", 'any one was inclined to be indifferent to the Cuban war for\\n', 'independence, he was now met by the vehement cry: \"Remember the\\n', '_Maine_!\"\\n', '\\n', \"=Spanish Concessions.=--Still the State Department, under McKinley's\\n\", 'steady hand, pursued the path of negotiation, Spain proving more pliable\\n', 'and more ready with promises of reform in the island. Early in April,\\n', 'however, there came a decided change in the tenor of American diplomacy.\\n', 'On the 4th, McKinley, evidently convinced that promises did not mean\\n', 'performances, instructed our minister at Madrid to warn the Spanish\\n', 'government that as no effective armistice had been offered to the\\n', 'Cubans, he would lay the whole matter before Congress. This decision,\\n', 'every one knew, from the temper of Congress, meant war--a prospect which\\n', 'excited all the European powers. The Pope took an active interest in the\\n', 'crisis. France and Germany, foreseeing from long experience in world\\n', 'politics an increase of American power and prestige through war, sought\\n', 'to prevent it. Spain, hopeless and conscious of her weakness, at last\\n', 'dispatched to the President a note promising to suspend hostilities, to\\n', 'call a Cuban parliament, and to grant all the autonomy that could be\\n', 'reasonably asked.\\n', '\\n', '=President McKinley Calls for War.=--For reasons of his own--reasons\\n', 'which have never yet been fully explained--McKinley ignored the final\\n', 'program of concessions presented by Spain. At the very moment when his\\n', 'patient negotiations seemed to bear full fruit, he veered sharply from\\n', 'his course and launched the country into the war by sending to Congress\\n', 'his militant message of April 11, 1898. Without making public the last\\n', 'note he had received from Spain, he declared that he was brought to the\\n', 'end of his effort and the cause was in the hands of Congress. Humanity,\\n', 'the protection of American citizens and property, the injuries to\\n', 'American commerce and business, the inability of Spain to bring about\\n', 'permanent peace in the island--these were the grounds for action that\\n', 'induced him to ask for authority to employ military and naval forces in\\n', 'establishing a stable government in Cuba. They were sufficient for a\\n', 'public already straining at the leash.\\n', '\\n', '=The Resolution of Congress.=--There was no doubt of the outcome when\\n', 'the issue was withdrawn from diplomacy and placed in charge of Congress.\\n', 'Resolutions were soon introduced into the House of Representatives\\n', 'authorizing the President to employ armed force in securing peace and\\n', 'order in the island and \"establishing by the free action of the people\\n', 'thereof a stable and independent government of their own.\" To the form\\n', 'and spirit of this proposal the Democrats and Populists took exception.\\n', 'In the Senate, where they were stronger, their position had to be\\n', 'reckoned with by the narrow Republican majority. As the resolution\\n', 'finally read, the independence of Cuba was recognized; Spain was called\\n', 'upon to relinquish her authority and withdraw from the island; and the\\n', 'President was empowered to use force to the extent necessary to carry\\n', 'the resolutions into effect. Furthermore the United States disclaimed\\n', '\"any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or\\n', 'control over said island except for the pacification thereof.\" Final\\n', 'action was taken by Congress on April 19, 1898, and approved by the\\n', 'President on the following day.\\n', '\\n', '=War and Victory.=--Startling events then followed in swift succession.\\n', 'The navy, as a result in no small measure of the alertness of Theodore\\n', 'Roosevelt, Assistant Secretary of the Department, was ready for the\\n', 'trial by battle. On May 1, Commodore Dewey at Manila Bay shattered the\\n', 'Spanish fleet, marking the doom of Spanish dominion in the Philippines.\\n', 'On July 3, the Spanish fleet under Admiral Cervera, in attempting to\\n', 'escape from Havana, was utterly destroyed by American forces under\\n', 'Commodore Schley. On July 17, Santiago, invested by American troops\\n', 'under General Shafter and shelled by the American ships, gave up the\\n', 'struggle. On July 25 General Miles landed in Porto Rico. On August 13,\\n', 'General Merritt and Admiral Dewey carried Manila by storm. The war was\\n', 'over.\\n', '\\n', '=The Peace Protocol.=--Spain had already taken cognizance of stern\\n', 'facts. As early as July 26, 1898, acting through the French ambassador,\\n', 'M. Cambon, the Madrid government approached President McKinley for a\\n', 'statement of the terms on which hostilities could be brought to a close.\\n', 'After some skirmishing Spain yielded reluctantly to the ultimatum. On\\n', 'August 12, the preliminary peace protocol was signed, stipulating that\\n', 'Cuba should be free, Porto Rico ceded to the United States, and Manila\\n', 'occupied by American troops pending the formal treaty of peace. On\\n', 'October 1, the commissioners of the two countries met at Paris to bring\\n', 'about the final settlement.\\n', '\\n', '=Peace Negotiations.=--When the day for the first session of the\\n', 'conference arrived, the government at Washington apparently had not made\\n', 'up its mind on the final disposition of the Philippines. Perhaps, before\\n', 'the battle of Manila Bay, not ten thousand people in the United States\\n', 'knew or cared where the Philippines were. Certainly there was in the\\n', 'autumn of 1898 no decided opinion as to what should be done with the\\n', \"fruits of Dewey's victory. President McKinley doubtless voiced the\\n\", 'sentiment of the people when he stated to the peace commissioners on the\\n', 'eve of their departure that there had originally been no thought of\\n', 'conquest in the Pacific.\\n', '\\n', 'The march of events, he added, had imposed new duties on the country.\\n', '\"Incidental to our tenure in the Philippines,\" he said, \"is the\\n', 'commercial opportunity to which American statesmanship cannot be\\n', 'indifferent. It is just to use every legitimate means for the\\n', 'enlargement of American trade.\" On this ground he directed the\\n', 'commissioners to accept not less than the cession of the island of\\n', 'Luzon, the chief of the Philippine group, with its harbor of Manila. It\\n', 'was not until the latter part of October that he definitely instructed\\n', 'them to demand the entire archipelago, on the theory that the occupation\\n', 'of Luzon alone could not be justified \"on political, commercial, or\\n', 'humanitarian grounds.\" This departure from the letter of the peace\\n', 'protocol was bitterly resented by the Spanish agents. It was with\\n', \"heaviness of heart that they surrendered the last sign of Spain's\\n\", 'ancient dominion in the far Pacific.\\n', '\\n', '=The Final Terms of Peace.=--The treaty of peace, as finally agreed\\n', 'upon, embraced the following terms: the independence of Cuba; the\\n', 'cession of Porto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States;\\n', 'the settlement of claims filed by the citizens of both countries; the\\n', 'payment of twenty million dollars to Spain by the United States for the\\n', 'Philippines; and the determination of the status of the inhabitants of\\n', 'the ceded territories by Congress. The great decision had been made. Its\\n', 'issue was in the hands of the Senate where the Democrats and the\\n', 'Populists held the balance of power under the requirement of the\\n', 'two-thirds vote for ratification.\\n', '\\n', '=The Contest in America over the Treaty of Peace.=--The publication of\\n', 'the treaty committing the United States to the administration of distant\\n', 'colonies directed the shifting tides of public opinion into two distinct\\n', 'channels: support of the policy and opposition to it. The trend in\\n', 'Republican leadership, long in the direction marked out by the treaty,\\n', 'now came into the open. Perhaps a majority of the men highest in the\\n', 'councils of that party had undergone the change of heart reflected in\\n', 'the letters of John Hay, Secretary of State. In August of 1898 he had\\n', 'hinted, in a friendly letter to Andrew Carnegie, that he sympathized\\n', 'with the latter\\'s opposition to \"imperialism\"; but he had added quickly:\\n', '\"The only question in my mind is how far it is now possible for us to\\n', 'withdraw from the Philippines.\" In November of the same year he wrote to\\n', 'Whitelaw Reid, one of the peace commissioners at Paris: \"There is a wild\\n', 'and frantic attack now going on in the press against the whole\\n', 'Philippine transaction. Andrew Carnegie really seems to be off his\\n', 'head.... But all this confusion of tongues will go its way. The country\\n', 'will applaud the resolution that has been reached and you will return in\\n', 'the role of conquering heroes with your \\'brows bound with oak.\\'\"\\n', '\\n', 'Senator Beveridge of Indiana and Senator Platt of Connecticut, accepting\\n', 'the verdict of history as the proof of manifest destiny, called for\\n', 'unquestioning support of the administration in its final step. \"Every\\n', 'expansion of our territory,\" said the latter, \"has been in accordance\\n', 'with the irresistible law of growth. We could no more resist the\\n', 'successive expansions by which we have grown to be the strongest nation\\n', 'on earth than a tree can resist its growth. The history of territorial\\n', \"expansion is the history of our nation's progress and glory. It is a\\n\", 'matter to be proud of, not to lament. We should rejoice that Providence\\n', 'has given us the opportunity to extend our influence, our institutions,\\n', 'and our civilization into regions hitherto closed to us, rather than\\n', 'contrive how we can thwart its designs.\"\\n', '\\n', \"This doctrine was savagely attacked by opponents of McKinley's policy,\\n\", 'many a stanch Republican joining with the majority of Democrats in\\n', 'denouncing the treaty as a departure from the ideals of the republic.\\n', 'Senator Vest introduced in the Senate a resolution that \"under the\\n', 'Constitution of the United States, no power is given to the federal\\n', 'Government to acquire territory to be held and governed permanently as\\n', 'colonies.\" Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, whose long and honorable\\n', 'career gave weight to his lightest words, inveighed against the whole\\n', 'procedure and to the end of his days believed that the new drift into\\n', 'rivalry with European nations as a colonial power was fraught with\\n', 'genuine danger. \"Our imperialistic friends,\" he said, \"seem to have\\n', 'forgotten the use of the vocabulary of liberty. They talk about giving\\n', \"good government. 'We shall give them such a government as we think they\\n\", \"are fitted for.' 'We shall give them a better government than they had\\n\", \"before.' Why, Mr. President, that one phrase conveys to a free man and a\\n\", 'free people the most stinging of insults. In that little phrase, as in a\\n', 'seed, is contained the germ of all despotism and of all tyranny.\\n', 'Government is not a gift. Free government is not to be given by all the\\n', 'blended powers of earth and heaven. It is a birthright. It belongs, as\\n', 'our fathers said, and as their children said, as Jefferson said, and as\\n', 'President McKinley said, to human nature itself.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Senate, more conservative on the question of annexation than the\\n', 'House of Representatives composed of men freshly elected in the stirring\\n', 'campaign of 1896, was deliberate about ratification of the treaty. The\\n', 'Democrats and Populists were especially recalcitrant. Mr. Bryan hurried\\n', 'to Washington and brought his personal influence to bear in favor of\\n', 'speedy action. Patriotism required ratification, it was said in one\\n', 'quarter. The country desires peace and the Senate ought not to delay, it\\n', 'was urged in another. Finally, on February 6, 1899, the requisite\\n', 'majority of two-thirds was mustered, many a Senator who voted for the\\n', 'treaty, however, sharing the misgivings of Senator Hoar as to the\\n', '\"dangers of imperialism.\" Indeed at the time, the Senators passed a\\n', 'resolution declaring that the policy to be adopted in the Philippines\\n', 'was still an open question, leaving to the future, in this way, the\\n', 'possibility of retracing their steps.\\n', '\\n', '=The Attitude of England.=--The Spanish war, while accomplishing the\\n', 'simple objects of those who launched the nation on that course, like all\\n', 'other wars, produced results wholly unforeseen. In the first place, it\\n', 'exercised a profound influence on the drift of opinion among European\\n', 'powers. In England, sympathy with the United States was from the first\\n', 'positive and outspoken. \"The state of feeling here,\" wrote Mr. Hay, then\\n', 'ambassador in London, \"is the best I have ever known. From every quarter\\n', 'the evidences of it come to me. The royal family by habit and tradition\\n', 'are most careful not to break the rules of strict neutrality, but even\\n', 'among them I find nothing but hearty kindness and--so far as is\\n', 'consistent with propriety--sympathy. Among the political leaders on both\\n', \"sides I find not only sympathy but a somewhat eager desire that 'the\\n\", 'other fellows\\' shall not seem more friendly.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Joseph Chamberlain, the distinguished Liberal statesman, thinking no\\n', 'doubt of the continental situation, said in a political address at the\\n', 'very opening of the war that the next duty of Englishmen \"is to\\n', 'establish and maintain bonds of permanent unity with our kinsmen across\\n', 'the Atlantic.... I even go so far as to say that, terrible as war may\\n', 'be, even war would be cheaply purchased if, in a great and noble cause,\\n', 'the Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack should wave together over an\\n', 'Anglo-Saxon alliance.\" To the American ambassador he added\\n', 'significantly that he did not \"care a hang what they say about it on the\\n', 'continent,\" which was another way of expressing the hope that the\\n', 'warning to Germany and France was sufficient. This friendly English\\n', 'opinion, so useful to the United States when a combination of powers to\\n', 'support Spain was more than possible, removed all fears as to the\\n', 'consequences of the war. Henry Adams, recalling days of humiliation in\\n', 'London during the Civil War, when his father was the American\\n', 'ambassador, coolly remarked that it was \"the sudden appearance of\\n', 'Germany as the grizzly terror\" that \"frightened England into America\\'s\\n', 'arms\"; but the net result in keeping the field free for an easy triumph\\n', 'of American arms was none the less appreciated in Washington where,\\n', 'despite outward calm, fears of European complications were never absent.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'AMERICAN POLICIES IN THE PHILIPPINES AND THE ORIENT\\n', '\\n', '=The Filipino Revolt against American Rule.=--In the sphere of domestic\\n', 'politics, as well as in the field of foreign relations, the outcome of\\n', 'the Spanish war exercised a marked influence. It introduced at once\\n', 'problems of colonial administration and difficulties in adjusting trade\\n', 'relations with the outlying dominions. These were furthermore\\n', 'complicated in the very beginning by the outbreak of an insurrection\\n', 'against American sovereignty in the Philippines. The leader of the\\n', 'revolt, Aguinaldo, had been invited to join the American forces in\\n', 'overthrowing Spanish dominion, and he had assumed, apparently without\\n', 'warrant, that independence would be the result of the joint operations.\\n', 'When the news reached him that the American flag had been substituted\\n', 'for the Spanish flag, his resentment was keen. In February, 1899, there\\n', 'occurred a slight collision between his men and some American soldiers.\\n', 'The conflict thus begun was followed by serious fighting which finally\\n', 'dwindled into a vexatious guerrilla warfare lasting three years and\\n', 'costing heavily in men and money. Atrocities were committed by the\\n', 'native insurrectionists and, sad to relate, they were repaid in kind;\\n', 'it was argued in defense of the army that the ordinary rules of warfare\\n', 'were without terror to men accustomed to fighting like savages. In vain\\n', 'did McKinley assure the Filipinos that the institutions and laws\\n', 'established in the islands would be designed \"not for our satisfaction\\n', 'or for the expression of our theoretical views, but for the happiness,\\n', 'peace, and prosperity of the people of the Philippine Islands.\" Nothing\\n', 'short of military pressure could bring the warring revolutionists to\\n', 'terms.\\n', '\\n', '=Attacks on Republican \"Imperialism.\"=--The Filipino insurrection,\\n', 'following so quickly upon the ratification of the treaty with Spain,\\n', \"moved the American opponents of McKinley's colonial policies to redouble\\n\", 'their denunciation of what they were pleased to call \"imperialism.\"\\n', 'Senator Hoar was more than usually caustic in his indictment of the new\\n', 'course. The revolt against American rule did but convince him of the\\n', 'folly hidden in the first fateful measures. Everywhere he saw a\\n', 'conspiracy of silence and injustice. \"I have failed to discover in the\\n', 'speeches, public or private, of the advocates of this war,\" he contended\\n', 'in the Senate, \"or in the press which supports it and them, a single\\n', 'expression anywhere of a desire to do justice to the people of the\\n', 'Philippine Islands, or of a desire to make known to the people of the\\n', 'United States the truth of the case....

Anticipating attacks from every\\n', 'quarter, the Republicans, in renominating McKinley, set forth their\\n', 'position in clear and ringing phrases: \"In accepting by the treaty of\\n', 'Paris the just responsibility of our victories in the Spanish War the\\n', 'President and Senate won the undoubted approval of the American people.\\n', \"No other course was possible than to destroy Spain's sovereignty\\n\", 'throughout the West Indies and in the Philippine Islands.

Mr. Bryan, whom they selected as their\\n', 'candidate, still clung to the currency issue; but the main emphasis,\\n', 'both of the platform and the appeal for votes, was on the \"imperialistic\\n', 'program\" of the Republican administration. The Democrats denounced the\\n', 'treatment of Cuba and Porto Rico and condemned the Philippine policy in\\n', 'sharp and vigorous terms. \"As we are not willing,\" ran the platform, \"to\\n', 'surrender our civilization or to convert the Republic into an empire, we\\n', \"favor an immediate declaration of the Nation's purpose to give to the\\n\", 'Filipinos, first, a stable form of government; second, independence;\\n', 'third, protection from outside interference....

In the South many of the\\n', 'great plantations were broken up and sold in small farms, crops were\\n', 'diversified, the small farming class was raised in the scale of social\\n', 'importance, the cotton industry was launched, and the coal, iron,\\n', 'timber, and other resources were brought into use.

By the end of\\n', 'the century the American frontier had disappeared. The wild, primitive\\n', 'life so long associated with America was gone. The unity of the nation\\n', 'was established.\\n', '\\n', 'In the field of business enterprise, progress was most marked. The\\n', 'industrial system, which had risen and flourished before the Civil War,\\n', 'grew into immense proportions and the industrial area was extended from\\n', 'the Northeast into all parts of the country.

The idea of a water route\\n', 'across the isthmus, long a dream of navigators, had become a living\\n', 'issue after the historic voyage of the battleship _Oregon_ around South\\n', 'America during the Spanish War. But before the United States could act\\n', 'it had to undo the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, made with Great Britain in\\n', '1850, providing for the construction of the canal under joint\\n', 'supervision. This was finally effected by the Hay-Pauncefote treaty of\\n', '1901 authorizing the United States to proceed alone, on condition that\\n', 'there should be no discriminations against other nations in the matter\\n', 'of rates and charges.\\n', '\\n', 'This accomplished, it was necessary to decide just where the canal\\n', 'should be built. One group in Congress favored the route through\\n', 'Nicaragua; in fact, two official commissions had already approved that\\n', 'location.

After a heated argument over the\\n', 'merits of the two plans, preference was given to the Panama route. As\\n', 'the isthmus was then a part of Colombia, President Roosevelt proceeded\\n', 'to negotiate with the government at Bogota a treaty authorizing the\\n', 'United States to cut a canal through its territory. The treaty was\\n', 'easily framed, but it was rejected by the Colombian senate, much to the\\n', 'President\\'s exasperation. \"You could no more make an agreement with the\\n', 'Colombian rulers,\" he exclaimed, \"than you could nail jelly to a wall.\"\\n', 'He was spared the necessity by a timely revolution.

The rights and property of\\n', 'the French concern were then bought, and the final details settled. A\\n', 'lock rather than a sea-level canal was agreed upon. Construction by the\\n', 'government directly instead of by private contractors was adopted.\\n', 'Scientific medicine was summoned to stamp out the tropical diseases\\n', 'that had made Panama a plague spot. Finally, in 1904, as the President\\n', 'said, \"the dirt began to fly.\" After surmounting formidable\\n', 'difficulties--engineering, labor, and sanitary--the American forces in\\n', '1913 joined the waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific. Nearly eight\\n', 'thousand miles were cut off the sea voyage from New York to San\\n', 'Francisco. If any were inclined to criticize President Roosevelt for\\n', 'the way in which he snapped off negotiations with Colombia and\\n', 'recognized the Panama revolutionists, their attention was drawn to the\\n', 'magnificent outcome of the affair.

In this struggle, it seems,\\n', \"President Roosevelt's sympathies were mainly with the Japanese, although\\n\", 'he observed the proprieties of neutrality. At all events, Secretary Hay\\n', \"wrote in his diary on New Year's Day, 1905, that the President was\\n\", '\"quite firm in his view that we cannot permit Japan to be robbed a\\n', 'second time of her victory,\" referring to the fact that Japan, ten years\\n', 'before, after defeating China on the field of battle, had been forced by\\n', 'Russia, Germany, and France to forego the fruits of conquest.\\n', '\\n', \"Whatever the President's personal feelings may have been, he was aware\\n\", 'that Japan, despite her triumphs over Russia, was staggering under a\\n', 'heavy burden of debt.

This clash grew\\n', 'out of the inability or unwillingness of the Venezuelan government to\\n', 'pay debts due foreign creditors. Having exhausted their patience in\\n', 'negotiations, England and Germany, in December 1901, sent battleships to\\n', 'establish what they characterized as \"a peaceful blockade\" of Venezuelan\\n', 'ports. Their action was followed by the rupture of diplomatic relations;\\n', 'there was a possibility that war and the occupation of Venezuelan\\n', 'territory might result.\\n', '\\n', 'While unwilling to stand between a Latin-American country and its\\n', 'creditors, President Roosevelt was determined that debt collecting\\n', 'should not be made an excuse for European countries to seize territory.\\n', 'He therefore urged arbitration of the dispute, winning the assent of\\n', 'England and Italy. Germany, with a somewhat haughty air, refused to take\\n', 'the milder course. The President, learning of this refusal, called the\\n', 'German ambassador to the White House and informed him in very precise\\n', 'terms that, unless the Imperial German Government consented to\\n', 'arbitrate, Admiral Dewey would be ordered to the scene with instructions\\n', 'to prevent Germany from seizing any Venezuelan territory. A week passed\\n', 'and no answer came from Berlin. Not baffled, the President again took\\n', 'the matter up with the ambassador, this time with even more firmness; he\\n', 'stated in language admitting of but one meaning that, unless within\\n', 'forty-eight hours the Emperor consented to arbitration, American\\n', 'battleships, already coaled and cleared, would sail for Venezuelan\\n', 'waters. The hint was sufficient. The Kaiser accepted the proposal and\\n', 'the President, with the fine irony of diplomacy, complimented him\\n', 'publicly on \"being so stanch an advocate of arbitration.\" In terms of\\n', 'the Monroe Doctrine this action meant that the United States, while not\\n', 'denying the obligations of debtors, would not permit any move on the\\n', 'part of European powers that might easily lead to the temporary or\\n', 'permanent occupation of Latin-American territory.\\n', '\\n', '=The Santo Domingo Affair.=--The same issue was involved in a\\n', 'controversy over Santo Domingo which arose in 1904. The Dominican\\n', 'republic, like Venezuela, was heavily in debt, and certain European\\n', 'countries declared that, unless the United States undertook to look\\n', 'after the finances of the embarrassed debtor, they would resort to armed\\n', 'coercion. What was the United States to do? The danger of having some\\n', 'European power strongly intrenched in Santo Domingo was too imminent to\\n', 'be denied. President Roosevelt acted with characteristic speed, and\\n', 'notwithstanding strong opposition in the Senate was able, in 1907, to\\n', 'effect a treaty arrangement which placed Dominican finances under\\n', 'American supervision.\\n', '\\n', 'In the course of the debate over this settlement, a number of\\n', 'interesting questions arose. It was pertinently asked whether the\\n', 'American navy should be used to help creditors collect their debts\\n', 'anywhere in Latin-America. It was suggested also that no sanction should\\n', 'be given to the practice among European governments of using armed force\\n', \"to collect private claims. Opponents of President Roosevelt's policy,\\n\", 'and they were neither few nor insignificant, urged that such matters\\n', 'should be referred to the Hague Court or to special international\\n', 'commissions for arbitration. To this the answer was made that the United\\n', 'States could not surrender any question coming under the terms of the\\n', 'Monroe Doctrine to the decision of an international tribunal. The\\n', 'position of the administration was very clearly stated by President\\n', 'Roosevelt himself. \"The country,\" he said, \"would certainly decline to\\n', 'go to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a just debt;\\n', 'on the other hand, it is very inadvisable to permit any foreign power to\\n', 'take possession, even temporarily, of the customs houses of an American\\n', 'republic in order to enforce the payment of its obligations; for such a\\n', 'temporary occupation might turn into a permanent occupation. The only\\n', 'escape from these alternatives may at any time be that we must\\n', 'ourselves undertake to bring about some arrangement by which so much as\\n', 'possible of a just obligation shall be paid.\" The Monroe Doctrine was\\n', 'negative. It denied to European powers a certain liberty of operation in\\n', 'this hemisphere. The positive obligations resulting from its application\\n', 'by the United States were points now emphasized and developed.\\n', '\\n', '=The Hague Conference.=--The controversies over Latin-American relations\\n', 'and his part in bringing the Russo-Japanese War to a close naturally\\n', 'made a deep impression upon Roosevelt, turning his mind in the direction\\n', 'of the peaceful settlement of international disputes. The subject was\\n', 'moreover in the air. As if conscious of impending calamity, the\\n', 'statesmen of the Old World, to all outward signs at least, seemed\\n', 'searching for a way to reduce armaments and avoid the bloody and costly\\n', 'trial of international causes by the ancient process of battle. It was\\n', 'the Czar, Nicholas II, fated to die in one of the terrible holocausts\\n', 'which he helped to bring upon mankind, who summoned the delegates of the\\n', 'nations in the first Hague Peace Conference in 1899. The conference did\\n', 'nothing to reduce military burdens or avoid wars but it did recognize\\n', 'the right of friendly nations to offer the services of mediation to\\n', 'countries at war and did establish a Court at the Hague for the\\n', 'arbitration of international disputes.\\n', '\\n', 'Encouraged by this experiment, feeble as it was, President Roosevelt in\\n', '1904 proposed a second conference, yielding to the Czar the honor of\\n', 'issuing the call. At this great international assembly, held at the\\n', 'Hague in 1907, the representatives of the United States proposed a plan\\n', 'for the compulsory arbitration of certain matters of international\\n', 'dispute. This was rejected with contempt by Germany. Reduction of\\n', 'armaments, likewise proposed in the conference, was again deferred. In\\n', 'fact, nothing was accomplished beyond agreement upon certain rules for\\n', 'the conduct of \"civilized warfare,\" casting a somewhat lurid light upon\\n', 'the \"pacific\" intentions of most of the powers assembled.\\n', '\\n', '=The World Tour of the Fleet.=--As if to assure the world then that the\\n', 'United States placed little reliance upon the frail reed of peace\\n', 'conferences, Roosevelt the following year (1908) made an imposing\\n', 'display of American naval power by sending a fleet of sixteen\\n', 'battleships on a tour around the globe. On his own authority, he ordered\\n', 'the ships to sail out of Hampton Roads and circle the earth by way of\\n', 'the Straits of Magellan, San Francisco, Australia, the Philippines,\\n', 'China, Japan, and the Suez Canal. This enterprise was not, as some\\n', 'critics claimed, a \"mere boyish flourish.\" President Roosevelt knew how\\n', 'deep was the influence of sea power on the fate of nations. He was aware\\n', 'that no country could have a wide empire of trade and dominion without\\n', 'force adequate to sustain it. The voyage around the world therefore\\n', 'served a double purpose. It interested his own country in the naval\\n', 'program of the government, and it reminded other powers that the\\n', 'American giant, though quiet, was not sleeping in the midst of\\n', 'international rivalries.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION\\n', '\\n', '=A Constitutional Question Settled.=--In colonial administration, as in\\n', 'foreign policy, President Roosevelt advanced with firm step in a path\\n', 'already marked out. President McKinley had defined the principles that\\n', 'were to control the development of Porto Rico and the Philippines. The\\n', 'Republican party had announced a program of pacification, gradual\\n', 'self-government, and commercial improvement. The only remaining question\\n', 'of importance, to use the popular phrase,--\"Does the Constitution follow\\n', 'the flag?\"--had been answered by the Supreme Court of the United States.\\n', 'Although it was well known that the Constitution did not contemplate the\\n', 'government of dependencies, such as the Philippines and Porto Rico, the\\n', 'Court, by generous and ingenious interpretations, found a way for\\n', 'Congress to apply any reasonable rules required by the occasion.\\n', '\\n', '=Porto Rico.=--The government of Porto Rico was a relatively simple\\n', 'matter. It was a single island with a fairly homogeneous population\\n', 'apart from the Spanish upper class. For a time after military occupation\\n', 'in 1898, it was administered under military rule. This was succeeded by\\n', 'the establishment of civil government under the \"organic act\" passed by\\n', 'Congress in 1900. The law assured to the Porto Ricans American\\n', 'protection but withheld American citizenship--a boon finally granted in\\n', '1917. It provided for a governor and six executive secretaries appointed\\n', 'by the President with the approval of the Senate; and for a legislature\\n', 'of two houses--one elected by popular native vote, and an upper chamber\\n', 'composed of the executive secretaries and five other persons appointed\\n', 'in the same manner. Thus the United States turned back to the provincial\\n', 'system maintained by England in Virginia or New York in old colonial\\n', 'days. The natives were given a voice in their government and the power\\n', 'of initiating laws; but the final word both in law-making and\\n', 'administration was vested in officers appointed in Washington. Such was\\n', 'the plan under which the affairs of Porto Rico were conducted by\\n', 'President Roosevelt. It lasted until the new organic act of 1917.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Photograph from Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'A SUGAR MILL, PORTO RICO]\\n', '\\n', '=The Philippines.=--The administration of the Philippines presented far\\n', 'more difficult questions. The number of islands, the variety of\\n', 'languages and races, the differences in civilization all combined to\\n', 'challenge the skill of the government. Moreover, there was raging in\\n', '1901 a stubborn revolt against American authority, which had to be\\n', 'faced. Following the lines laid down by President McKinley, the\\n', 'evolution of American policy fell into three stages. At first the\\n', 'islands were governed directly by the President under his supreme\\n', 'military power. In 1901 a civilian commission, headed by William Howard\\n', 'Taft, was selected by the President and charged with the government of\\n', 'the provinces in which order had been restored. Six years later, under\\n', 'the terms of an organic act, passed by Congress in 1902, the third stage\\n', 'was reached. The local government passed into the hands of a governor\\n', 'and commission, appointed by the President and Senate, and a\\n', 'legislature--one house elected by popular vote and an upper chamber\\n', '\\n', 'composed of the commission. This scheme, like that obtaining in Porto\\n', 'Rico, remained intact until a Democratic Congress under President\\n', \"Wilson's leadership carried the colonial administration into its fourth\\n\", 'phase by making both houses elective. Thus, by the steady pursuit of a\\n', 'liberal policy, self-government was extended to the dependencies; but it\\n', 'encouraged rather than extinguished the vigorous movement among the\\n', 'Philippine natives for independence.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'MR TAFT IN THE PHILIPPINES]\\n', '\\n', '=Cuban Relations.=--Within the sphere of colonial affairs, Cuba, though\\n', 'nominally independent, also presented problems to the government at\\n', 'Washington. In the fine enthusiasm that accompanied the declaration of\\n', 'war on Spain, Congress, unmindful of practical considerations,\\n', 'recognized the independence of Cuba and disclaimed \"any disposition or\\n', 'intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said\\n', 'island except for the pacification thereof.\" In the settlement that\\n', 'followed the war, however, it was deemed undesirable to set the young\\n', 'republic adrift upon the stormy sea of international politics without a\\n', 'guiding hand. Before withdrawing American troops from the island,\\n', 'Congress, in March, 1901, enacted, and required Cuba to approve, a\\n', 'series of restrictions known as the Platt amendment, limiting her power\\n', 'to incur indebtedness, securing the right of the United States to\\n', 'intervene whenever necessary to protect life and property, and reserving\\n', 'to the United States coaling stations at certain points to be agreed\\n', 'upon. The Cubans made strong protests against what they deemed\\n', '\"infringements of their sovereignty\"; but finally with good grace\\n', 'accepted their fate. Even when in 1906 President Roosevelt landed\\n', 'American troops in the island to quell a domestic dissension, they\\n', 'acquiesced in the action, evidently regarding it as a distinct warning\\n', 'that they should learn to manage their elections in an orderly manner.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE ROOSEVELT DOMESTIC POLICIES\\n', '\\n', '=Social Questions to the Front.=--From the day of his inauguration to\\n', 'the close of his service in 1909, President Roosevelt, in messages,\\n', 'speeches, and interviews, kept up a lively and interesting discussion of\\n', 'trusts, capital, labor, poverty, riches, lawbreaking, good citizenship,\\n', 'and kindred themes. Many a subject previously touched upon only by\\n', 'representatives of the minor and dissenting parties, he dignified by a\\n', 'careful examination. That he did this with any fixed design or policy in\\n', 'mind does not seem to be the case. He admitted himself that when he\\n', 'became President he did not have in hand any settled or far-reaching\\n', 'plan of social betterment. He did have, however, serious convictions on\\n', 'general principles. \"I was bent upon making the government,\" he wrote,\\n', '\"the most efficient possible instrument in helping the people of the\\n', 'United States to better themselves in every way, politically, socially,\\n', 'and industrially. I believed with all my heart in real and\\n', 'thorough-going democracy and I wished to make the democracy industrial\\n', 'as well as political, although I had only partially formulated the\\n', 'method I believed we should follow.\" It is thus evident at least that he\\n', 'had departed a long way from the old idea of the government as nothing\\n', 'but a great policeman keeping order among the people in a struggle over\\n', \"the distribution of the nation's wealth and resources.\\n\", '\\n', \"=Roosevelt's View of the Constitution.=--Equally significant was\\n\", \"Roosevelt's attitude toward the Constitution and the office of\\n\", 'President. He utterly repudiated the narrow construction of our national\\n', 'charter. He held that the Constitution \"should be treated as the\\n', 'greatest document ever devised by the wit of man to aid a people in\\n', 'exercising every power necessary for its own betterment, not as a\\n', 'strait-jacket cunningly fashioned to strangle growth.\" He viewed the\\n', 'presidency as he did the Constitution. Strict constructionists of the\\n', 'Jeffersonian school, of whom there were many on occasion even in the\\n', 'Republican party, had taken a view that the President could do nothing\\n', 'that he was not specifically authorized by the Constitution to do.\\n', 'Roosevelt took exactly the opposite position. It was his opinion that it\\n', 'was not only the President\\'s right but his duty \"to do anything that the\\n', 'needs of the nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the\\n', 'Constitution or the laws.\" He went on to say that he acted \"for the\\n', 'common well-being of all our people whenever and in whatever manner was\\n', 'necessary, unless prevented by direct constitutional or legislative\\n', 'prohibition.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Trusts and Railways.=--To the trust question, Roosevelt devoted\\n', 'especial attention. This was unavoidable. By far the larger part of the\\n', 'business of the country was done by corporations as distinguished from\\n', 'partnerships and individual owners. The growth of these gigantic\\n', 'aggregations of capital had been the leading feature in American\\n', 'industrial development during the last two decades of the nineteenth\\n', 'century. In the conquest of business by trusts and \"the resulting\\n', 'private fortunes of great magnitude,\" the Populists and the Democrats\\n', 'had seen a grievous danger to the republic. \"Plutocracy has taken the\\n', 'place of democracy; the tariff breeds trusts; let us destroy therefore\\n', 'the tariff and the trusts\"--such was the battle cry which had been taken\\n', 'up by Bryan and his followers.\\n', '\\n', 'President Roosevelt countered vigorously. He rejected the idea that the\\n', 'trusts were the product of the tariff or of governmental action of any\\n', 'kind. He insisted that they were the outcome of \"natural economic\\n', 'forces\": (1) destructive competition among business men compelling them\\n', 'to avoid ruin by cooperation in fixing prices; (2) the growth of markets\\n', 'on a national scale and even international scale calling for vast\\n', 'accumulations of capital to carry on such business; (3) the possibility\\n', 'of immense savings by the union of many plants under one management. In\\n', 'the corporation he saw a new stage in the development of American\\n', 'industry. Unregulated competition he regarded as \"the source of evils\\n', 'which all men concede must be remedied if this civilization of ours is\\n', 'to survive.\" The notion, therefore, that these immense business concerns\\n', 'should be or could be broken up by a decree of law, Roosevelt considered\\n', 'absurd.\\n', '\\n', 'At the same time he proposed that \"evil trusts\" should be prevented from\\n', '\"wrong-doing of any kind\"; that is, punished for plain swindling, for\\n', 'making agreements to limit output, for refusing to sell to customers who\\n', 'dealt with rival firms, and for conspiracies with railways to ruin\\n', 'competitors by charging high freight rates and for similar abuses.\\n', 'Accordingly, he proposed, not the destruction of the trusts, but their\\n', 'regulation by the government. This, he contended, would preserve the\\n', 'advantages of business on a national scale while preventing the evils\\n', 'that accompanied it. The railway company he declared to be a public\\n', 'servant. \"Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike.\"\\n', 'So he answered those who thought that trusts and railway combinations\\n', 'were private concerns to be managed solely by their owners without let\\n', 'or hindrance and also those who thought trusts and railway combinations\\n', 'could be abolished by tariff reduction or criminal prosecution.\\n', '\\n', '=The Labor Question.=--On the labor question, then pressing to the front\\n', 'in public interest, President Roosevelt took advanced ground for his\\n', 'time. He declared that the working-man, single-handed and empty-handed,\\n', 'threatened with starvation if unemployed, was no match for the employer\\n', 'who was able to bargain and wait. This led him, accordingly, to accept\\n', 'the principle of the trade union; namely, that only by collective\\n', 'bargaining can labor be put on a footing to measure its strength equally\\n', 'with capital. While he severely arraigned labor leaders who advocated\\n', 'violence and destructive doctrines, he held that \"the organization of\\n', 'labor into trade unions and federations is necessary, is beneficent, and\\n', 'is one of the greatest possible agencies in the attainment of a true\\n', 'industrial, as well as a true political, democracy in the United\\n', 'States.\" The last resort of trade unions in labor disputes, the strike,\\n', 'he approved in case negotiations failed to secure \"a fair deal.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He thought, however, that labor organizations, even if wisely managed,\\n', 'could not solve all the pressing social questions of the time. The aid\\n', 'of the government at many points he believed to be necessary to\\n', 'eliminate undeserved poverty, industrial diseases, unemployment, and the\\n', 'unfortunate consequences of industrial accidents. In his first message\\n', 'of 1901, for instance, he urged that workers injured in industry should\\n', 'have certain and ample compensation. From time to time he advocated\\n', 'other legislation to obtain what he called \"a larger measure of social\\n', 'and industrial justice.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Great Riches and Taxation.=--Even the challenge of the radicals, such\\n', 'as the Populists, who alleged that \"the toil of millions is boldly\\n', 'stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few\"--challenges which his\\n', 'predecessors did not consider worthy of notice--President Roosevelt\\n', 'refused to let pass without an answer. In his first message he denied\\n', 'the truth of the common saying that the rich were growing richer and the\\n', 'poor were growing poorer. He asserted that, on the contrary, the average\\n', 'man, wage worker, farmer, and small business man, was better off than\\n', 'ever before in the history of our country. That there had been abuses in\\n', 'the accumulation of wealth he did not pretend to ignore, but he believed\\n', 'that even immense fortunes, on the whole, represented positive benefits\\n', 'conferred upon the country. Nevertheless he felt that grave dangers to\\n', 'the safety and the happiness of the people lurked in great inequalities\\n', 'of wealth. In 1906 he wrote that he wished it were in his power to\\n', 'prevent the heaping up of enormous fortunes. The next year, to the\\n', 'astonishment of many leaders in his own party, he boldly announced in a\\n', 'message to Congress that he approved both income and inheritance taxes,\\n', 'then generally viewed as Populist or Democratic measures. He even took\\n', 'the stand that such taxes should be laid in order to bring about a more\\n', 'equitable distribution of wealth and greater equality of opportunity\\n', 'among citizens.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE ACTIVITIES\\n', '\\n', '=Economic Legislation.=--When President Roosevelt turned from the field\\n', 'of opinion he found himself in a different sphere. Many of his views\\n', 'were too advanced for the members of his party in Congress, and where\\n', 'results depended upon the making of new laws, his progress was slow.\\n', 'Nevertheless, in his administrations several measures were enacted that\\n', 'bore the stamp of his theories, though it could hardly be said that he\\n', 'dominated Congress to the same degree as did some other Presidents. The\\n', 'Hepburn Railway Act of 1906 enlarged the interstate commerce commission;\\n', \"it extended the commission's power over oil pipe lines, express\\n\", 'companies, and other interstate carriers; it gave the commission the\\n', 'right to reduce rates found to be unreasonable and discriminatory; it\\n', 'forbade \"midnight tariffs,\" that is, sudden changes in rates favoring\\n', 'certain shippers; and it prohibited common carriers from transporting\\n', 'goods owned by themselves, especially coal, except for their own proper\\n', 'use. Two important pure food and drug laws, enacted during the same\\n', 'year, were designed to protect the public against diseased meats and\\n', 'deleterious foods and drugs. A significant piece of labor legislation\\n', 'was an act of the same Congress making interstate railways liable to\\n', 'damages for injuries sustained by their employees. When this measure was\\n', 'declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court it was reenacted with the\\n', 'objectionable clauses removed. A second installment of labor legislation\\n', 'was offered in the law of 1908 limiting the hours of railway employees\\n', 'engaged as trainmen or telegraph operators.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Courtesy United States Reclamation Service._\\n', '\\n', 'THE ROOSEVELT DAM, PHOENIX, ARIZONA]\\n', '\\n', '=Reclamation and Conservation.=--The open country--the deserts, the\\n', 'forests, waterways, and the public lands--interested President Roosevelt\\n', 'no less than railway and industrial questions. Indeed, in his first\\n', 'message to Congress he placed the conservation of natural resources\\n', 'among \"the most vital internal problems\" of the age, and forcibly\\n', 'emphasized an issue that had been discussed in a casual way since\\n', \"Cleveland's first administration. The suggestion evoked an immediate\\n\", 'response in Congress. Under the leadership of Senator Newlands, of\\n', 'Nevada, the Reclamation Act of 1902 was passed, providing for the\\n', 'redemption of the desert areas of the West. The proceeds from the sale\\n', 'of public lands were dedicated to the construction of storage dams and\\n', 'sluiceways to hold water and divert it as needed to the thirsty sands.\\n', 'Furthermore it was stipulated that the rents paid by water users should\\n', 'go into a reclamation fund to continue the good work forever.\\n', 'Construction was started immediately under the terms of the law. Within\\n', 'seventeen years about 1,600,000 acres had been reclaimed and more than a\\n', 'million were actually irrigated. In the single year 1918, the crops of\\n', 'the irrigated districts were valued at approximately $100,000,000.\\n', '\\n', 'In his first message, also, President Roosevelt urged the transfer of\\n', 'all control over national forests to trained men in the Bureau of\\n', 'Forestry--a recommendation carried out in 1907 when the Forestry Service\\n', 'was created. In every direction noteworthy advances were made in the\\n', 'administration of the national domain. The science of forestry was\\n', 'improved and knowledge of the subject spread among the people. Lands in\\n', 'the national forest available for agriculture were opened to settlers.\\n', 'Water power sites on the public domain were leased for a term of years\\n', 'to private companies instead of being sold outright. The area of the\\n', 'national forests was enlarged from 43 million acres to 194 million acres\\n', 'by presidential proclamation--more than 43 million acres being added in\\n', 'one year, 1907. The men who turned sheep and cattle to graze on the\\n', 'public lands were compelled to pay a fair rental, much to their\\n', 'dissatisfaction. Fire prevention work was undertaken in the forests on a\\n', 'large scale, reducing the appalling, annual destruction of timber.\\n', 'Millions of acres of coal land, such as the government had been\\n', 'carelessly selling to mining companies at low figures, were withdrawn\\n', 'from sale and held until Congress was prepared to enact laws for the\\n', 'disposition of them in the public interest. Prosecutions were\\n', 'instituted against men who had obtained public lands by fraud and vast\\n', 'tracts were recovered for the national domain. An agitation was begun\\n', 'which bore fruit under the administrations of Taft and Wilson in laws\\n', 'reserving to the federal government the ownership of coal, water power,\\n', 'phosphates, and other natural resources while authorizing corporations\\n', 'to develop them under leases for a period of years.\\n', '\\n', '=The Prosecution of the Trusts.=--As an executive, President Roosevelt\\n', 'was also a distinct \"personality.\" His discrimination between \"good\" and\\n', '\"bad\" trusts led him to prosecute some of them with vigor. On his\\n', 'initiative, the Northern Securities Company, formed to obtain control of\\n', 'certain great western railways, was dissolved by order of the Supreme\\n', 'Court. Proceedings were instituted against the American Tobacco Company\\n', 'and the Standard Oil Company as monopolies in violation of the Sherman\\n', 'Anti-Trust law. The Sugar Trust was found guilty of cheating the New\\n', 'York customs house and some of the minor officers were sent to prison.\\n', 'Frauds in the Post-office Department were uncovered and the offenders\\n', 'brought to book. In fact hardly a week passed without stirring news of\\n', '\"wrong doers\" and \"malefactors\" haled into federal courts.\\n', '\\n', '=The Great Coal Strike.=--The Roosevelt theory that the President could\\n', 'do anything for public welfare not forbidden by the Constitution and the\\n', 'laws was put to a severe test in 1902. A strike of the anthracite coal\\n', 'miners, which started in the summer, ran late into the autumn.\\n', 'Industries were paralyzed for the want of coal; cities were threatened\\n', 'with the appalling menace of a winter without heat. Governors and mayors\\n', 'were powerless and appealed for aid. The mine owners rejected the\\n', 'demands of the men and refused to permit the arbitration of the points\\n', 'in dispute, although John Mitchell, the leader of the miners, repeatedly\\n', 'urged it. After observing closely the course affairs, President\\n', 'Roosevelt made up his mind that the situation was intolerable. He\\n', 'arranged to have the federal troops, if necessary, take possession of\\n', 'the mines and operate them until the strike could be settled. He then\\n', 'invited the contestants to the White House and by dint of hard labor\\n', 'induced them to accept, as a substitute or compromise, arbitration by a\\n', 'commission which he appointed. Thus, by stepping outside the\\n', 'Constitution and acting as the first citizen of the land, President\\n', 'Roosevelt averted a crisis of great magnitude.\\n', '\\n', '=The Election of 1904.=--The views and measures which he advocated with\\n', 'such vigor aroused deep hostility within as well as without his party.\\n', 'There were rumors of a Republican movement to defeat his nomination in\\n', '1904 and it was said that the \"financial and corporation interests\" were\\n', 'in arms against him. A prominent Republican paper in New York City\\n', 'accused him of having \"stolen Mr. Bryan\\'s thunder,\" by harrying the\\n', 'trusts and favoring labor unions. When the Republican convention\\n', 'assembled in Chicago, however, the opposition disappeared and Roosevelt\\n', 'was nominated by acclamation.\\n', '\\n', 'This was the signal for a change on the part of Democratic leaders. They\\n', 'denounced the President as erratic, dangerous, and radical and decided\\n', 'to assume the moderate role themselves. They put aside Mr. Bryan and\\n', 'selected as their candidate, Judge Alton B. Parker, of New York, a man\\n', '\\n', 'who repudiated free silver and made a direct appeal for the conservative\\n', \"vote. The outcome of the reversal was astounding. Judge Parker's vote\\n\", 'fell more than a million below that cast for Bryan in 1900; of the 476\\n', 'electoral votes he received only 140. Roosevelt, in addition to sweeping\\n', 'the Republican sections, even invaded Democratic territory, carrying the\\n', 'state of Missouri. Thus vindicated at the polls, he became more\\n', 'outspoken than ever. His leadership in the party was so widely\\n', 'recognized that he virtually selected his own successor.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT TAFT\\n', '\\n', '=The Campaign of 1908.=--Long before the end of his elective term,\\n', 'President Roosevelt let it be known that he favored as his successor,\\n', 'William Howard Taft, of Ohio, his Secretary of War. To attain this end\\n', 'he used every shred of his powerful influence. When the Republican\\n', 'convention assembled, Mr. Taft easily won the nomination. Though the\\n', 'party platform was conservative in tone, he gave it a progressive tinge\\n', 'by expressing his personal belief in the popular election of United\\n', 'States Senators, an income tax, and other liberal measures. President\\n', 'Roosevelt announced his faith in the Republican candidate and appealed\\n', 'to the country for his election.\\n', '\\n', 'The turn in Republican affairs now convinced Mr. Bryan that the signs\\n', 'were propitious for a third attempt to win the presidency. The disaster\\n', 'to Judge Parker had taught the party that victory did not lie in a\\n', 'conservative policy. With little difficulty, therefore, the veteran\\n', 'leader from Nebraska once more rallied the Democrats around his\\n', 'standard, won the nomination, and wrote a platform vigorously attacking\\n', 'the tariff, trusts, and monopolies. Supported by a loyal following, he\\n', 'entered the lists, only to meet another defeat. Though he polled almost\\n', 'a million and a half more votes than did Judge Parker in 1904, the palm\\n', 'went to Mr. Taft.\\n', '\\n', '=The Tariff Revision and Party Dissensions.=--At the very beginning of\\n', 'his term, President Taft had to face the tariff issue. He had met it in\\n', 'the campaign. Moved by the Democratic demand for a drastic reduction, he\\n', 'had expressed opinions which were thought to imply a \"downward\\n', 'revision.\" The Democrats made much of the implication and the\\n', 'Republicans from the Middle West rejoiced in it. Pressure was coming\\n', 'from all sides. More than ten years had elapsed since the enactment of\\n', 'the Dingley bill and the position of many industries had been altered\\n', 'with the course of time. Evidently the day for revision--at best a\\n', 'thankless task--had arrived. Taft accepted the inevitable and called\\n', 'Congress in a special session. Until the midsummer of 1909, Republican\\n', 'Senators and Representatives wrangled over tariff schedules, the\\n', 'President making little effort to influence their decisions. When on\\n', 'August 5 the Payne-Aldrich bill became a law, a breach had been made in\\n', 'Republican ranks. Powerful Senators from the Middle West had spoken\\n', 'angrily against many of the high rates imposed by the bill. They had\\n', 'even broken with their party colleagues to vote against the entire\\n', 'scheme of tariff revision.\\n', '\\n', '=The Income Tax Amendment.=--The rift in party harmony was widened by\\n', 'another serious difference of opinion. During the debate on the tariff\\n', 'bill, there was a concerted movement to include in it an income tax\\n', 'provision--this in spite of the decision of the Supreme Court in 1895\\n', 'declaring it unconstitutional. Conservative men were alarmed by the\\n', 'evident willingness of some members to flout a solemn decree of that\\n', 'eminent tribunal. At the same time they saw a powerful combination of\\n', 'Republicans and Democrats determined upon shifting some of the burden of\\n', 'taxation to large incomes. In the press of circumstances, a compromise\\n', 'was reached. The income tax bill was dropped for the present; but\\n', 'Congress passed the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution, authorizing\\n', 'taxes upon incomes from whatever source they might be derived, without\\n', 'reference to any apportionment among the states on the basis of\\n', 'population. The states ratified the amendment and early in 1913 it was\\n', 'proclaimed.\\n', '\\n', \"=President Taft's Policies.=--After the enactment of the tariff bill,\\n\", 'Taft continued to push forward with his legislative program. He\\n', 'recommended, and Congress created, a special court of commerce with\\n', 'jurisdiction, among other things, over appeals from the interstate\\n', 'commerce commission, thus facilitating judicial review of the railway\\n', 'rates fixed and the orders issued by that body. This measure was quickly\\n', 'followed by an act establishing a system of postal savings banks in\\n', 'connection with the post office--a scheme which had long been opposed by\\n', 'private banks. Two years later, Congress defied the lobby of the express\\n', 'companies and supplemented the savings banks with a parcels post system,\\n', 'thus enabling the American postal service to catch up with that of other\\n', 'progressive nations. With a view to improving the business\\n', 'administration of the federal government, the President obtained from\\n', 'Congress a large appropriation for an economy and efficiency commission\\n', 'charged with the duty of inquiring into wasteful and obsolete methods\\n', 'and recommending improved devices and practices. The chief result of\\n', 'this investigation was a vigorous report in favor of a national budget\\n', 'system, which soon found public backing.\\n', '\\n', 'President Taft negotiated with England and France general treaties\\n', 'providing for the arbitration of disputes which were \"justiciable\" in\\n', 'character even though they might involve questions of \"vital interest\\n', 'and national honor.\" They were coldly received in the Senate and so\\n', 'amended that Taft abandoned them altogether. A tariff reciprocity\\n', 'agreement with Canada, however, he forced through Congress in the face\\n', 'of strong opposition from his own party. After making a serious breach\\n', 'in Republican ranks, he was chagrined to see the whole scheme come to\\n', 'naught by the overthrow of the Liberals in the Canadian elections of\\n', '1911.\\n', '\\n', '=Prosecution of the Trusts.=--The party schism was even enlarged by what\\n', 'appeared to be the successful prosecution of several great combinations.\\n', 'In two important cases, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of the\\n', 'Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company on the ground that\\n', 'they violated the Sherman Anti-Trust law. In taking this step Chief\\n', 'Justice White was at some pains to state that the law did not apply to\\n', 'combinations which did not \"unduly\" restrain trade. His remark,\\n', 'construed to mean that the Court would not interfere with corporations\\n', 'as such, became the subject of a popular outcry against the President\\n', 'and the judges.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'PROGRESSIVE INSURGENCY AND THE ELECTION OF 1912\\n', '\\n', \"=Growing Dissensions.=--All in all, Taft's administration from the first\\n\", 'day had been disturbed by party discord. High words had passed over the\\n', 'tariff bill and disgruntled members of Congress could not forget them.\\n', 'To differences over issues were added quarrels between youth and old\\n', 'age. In the House of Representatives there developed a group of young\\n', '\"insurgent\" Republicans who resented the dominance of the Speaker,\\n', 'Joseph G. Cannon, and other members of the \"old guard,\" as they named\\n', 'the men of long service and conservative minds. In 1910, the insurgents\\n', 'went so far as to join with the Democrats in a movement to break the\\n', \"Speaker's sway by ousting him from the rules committee and depriving him\\n\", 'of the power to appoint its members. The storm was brewing. In the\\n', 'autumn of that year the Democrats won a clear majority in the House of\\n', 'Representatives and began an open battle with President Taft by\\n', 'demanding an immediate downward revision of the tariff.\\n', '\\n', '=The Rise of the Progressive Republicans.=--Preparatory to the campaign\\n', 'of 1912, the dissenters within the Republican party added the prefix\\n', '\"Progressive\" to their old title and began to organize a movement to\\n', 'prevent the renomination of Mr. Taft. As early as January 21, 1911, they\\n', 'formed a Progressive Republican League at the home of Senator La\\n', 'Follette of Wisconsin and launched an attack on the Taft measures and\\n', 'policies. In October they indorsed Mr. La Follette as \"the logical\\n', 'Republican candidate\" and appealed to the party for support. The\\n', 'controversy over the tariff had grown into a formidable revolt against\\n', 'the occupant of the White House.\\n', '\\n', '=Roosevelt in the Field.=--After looking on for a while, ex-President\\n', 'Roosevelt took a hand in the fray. Soon after his return in 1910 from a\\n', 'hunting trip in Africa and a tour in Europe, he made a series of\\n', 'addresses in which he formulated a progressive program. In a speech in\\n', 'Kansas, he favored regulation of the trusts, a graduated income tax\\n', 'bearing heavily on great fortunes, tariff revision schedule by schedule,\\n', 'conservation of natural resources, labor legislation, the direct\\n', 'primary, and the recall of elective officials. In an address before the\\n', 'Ohio state constitutional convention in February, 1912, he indorsed the\\n', 'initiative and referendum and announced a doctrine known as the \"recall\\n', 'of judicial decisions.\" This was a new and radical note in American\\n', 'politics. An ex-President of the United States proposed that the people\\n', 'at the polls should have the right to reverse the decision of a judge\\n', 'who set aside any act of a state legislature passed in the interests of\\n', 'social welfare. The Progressive Republicans, impressed by these\\n', 'addresses, turned from La Follette to Roosevelt and on February 24,\\n', 'induced him to come out openly as a candidate against Taft for the\\n', 'Republican nomination.\\n', '\\n', '=The Split in the Republican Party.=--The country then witnessed the\\n', 'strange spectacle of two men who had once been close companions engaged\\n', 'in a bitter rivalry to secure a majority of the delegates to the\\n', 'Republican convention to be held at Chicago. When the convention\\n', 'assembled, about one-fourth of the seats were contested, the delegates\\n', 'for both candidates loudly proclaiming the regularity of their election.\\n', 'In deciding between the contestants the national committee, after the\\n', 'usual hearings, settled the disputes in such a way that Taft received a\\n', 'safe majority. After a week of negotiation, Roosevelt and his followers\\n', 'left the Republican party. Most of his supporters withdrew from the\\n', 'convention and the few who remained behind refused to answer the roll\\n', 'call. Undisturbed by this formidable bolt, the regular Republicans went\\n', 'on with their work. They renominated Mr. Taft and put forth a platform\\n', 'roundly condemning such Progressive doctrines as the recall of judges.\\n', '\\n', '=The Formation of the Progressive Party.=--The action of the Republicans\\n', 'in seating the Taft delegates was vigorously denounced by Roosevelt. He\\n', 'declared that the convention had no claim to represent the voters of the\\n', 'Republican party; that any candidate named by it would be \"the\\n', 'beneficiary of a successful fraud\"; and that it would be deeply\\n', \"discreditable to any man to accept the convention's approval under such\\n\", 'circumstances. The bitterness of his followers was extreme. On July 8, a\\n', 'call went forth for a \"Progressive\" convention to be held in Chicago on\\n', 'August 5. The assembly which duly met on that day was a unique political\\n', 'conference. Prominence was given to women delegates, and \"politicians\"\\n', 'were notably absent. Roosevelt himself, who was cheered as a conquering\\n', 'hero, made an impassioned speech setting forth his \"confession of\\n', 'faith.\" He was nominated by acclamation; Governor Hiram Johnson of\\n', 'California was selected as his companion candidate for Vice President.\\n', 'The platform endorsed such political reforms as woman suffrage, direct\\n', 'primaries, the initiative, referendum, and recall, popular election of\\n', 'United States Senators, and the short ballot. It favored a program of\\n', 'social legislation, including the prohibition of child labor and minimum\\n', 'wages for women. It approved the regulation, rather than the\\n', 'dissolution, of the trusts. Like apostles in a new and lofty cause, the\\n', 'Progressives entered a vigorous campaign for the election of their\\n', 'distinguished leader.\\n', '\\n', '=Woodrow Wilson and the Election of 1912.=--With the Republicans\\n', 'divided, victory loomed up before the Democrats. Naturally, a terrific\\n', 'contest over the nomination occurred at their convention in Baltimore.\\n', 'Champ Clark, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Governor\\n', 'Woodrow Wilson, of New Jersey, were the chief contestants. After tossing\\n', 'to and fro for seven long, hot days, and taking forty-six ballots, the\\n', 'delegates, powerfully influenced by Mr. Bryan, finally decided in favor\\n', 'of the governor. As a professor, a writer on historical and political\\n', 'subjects, and the president of Princeton University, Mr. Wilson had\\n', 'become widely known in public life. As the governor of New Jersey he had\\n', 'attracted the support of the progressives in both parties. With grim\\n', 'determination he had \"waged war on the bosses,\" and pushed through the\\n', 'legislature measures establishing direct primaries, regulating public\\n', \"utilities, and creating a system of workmen's compensation in\\n\", 'industries. During the presidential campaign that followed Governor\\n', 'Wilson toured the country and aroused great enthusiasm by a series of\\n', 'addresses later published under the title of _The New Freedom_. He\\n', 'declared that \"the government of the United States is at present the\\n', 'foster child of the special interests.\" He proposed to free the country\\n', 'by breaking the dominance of \"the big bankers, the big manufacturers,\\n', 'the big masters of commerce, the heads of railroad corporations and of\\n', 'steamship corporations.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In the election Governor Wilson easily secured a majority of the\\n', 'electoral votes, and his party, while retaining possession of the House\\n', 'of Representatives, captured the Senate as well. The popular verdict,\\n', 'however, indicated a state of confusion in the country. The combined\\n', 'Progressive and Republican vote exceeded that of the Democrats by\\n', '1,300,000. The Socialists, with Eugene V. Debs as their candidate again,\\n', 'polled about 900,000 votes, more than double the number received four\\n', 'years before. Thus, as the result of an extraordinary upheaval the\\n', 'Republicans, after holding the office of President for sixteen years,\\n', 'passed out of power, and the government of the country was intrusted to\\n', 'the Democrats under the leadership of a man destined to be one of the\\n', 'outstanding figures of the modern age, Woodrow Wilson.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=General References=\\n', '\\n', 'J.B.

It had been\\n', 'long in preparation. The revolt against corruption in politics which\\n', 'produced the Liberal Republican outbreak in the seventies and the\\n', 'Mugwump movement of the eighties was followed by continuous criticism of\\n', 'American political and economic development. From 1880 until his death\\n', 'in 1892, George William Curtis, as president of the Civil Service Reform\\n', 'Association, kept up a running fire upon the abuses of the spoils\\n', 'system. James Bryce, an observant English scholar and man of affairs, in\\n', 'his great work, _The American Commonwealth_, published in 1888, by\\n', 'picturing fearlessly the political rings and machines which dominated\\n', 'the cities, gave the whole country a fresh shock. Six years later Henry\\n', 'D. Lloyd, in a powerful book entitled _Wealth against Commonwealth_,\\n', 'attacked in scathing language certain trusts which had destroyed their\\n', 'rivals and bribed public officials. In 1903 Miss Ida Tarbell, an author\\n', 'of established reputation in the historical field, gave to the public an\\n', 'account of the Standard Oil Company, revealing the ruthless methods of\\n', 'that corporation in crushing competition. About the same time Lincoln\\n', 'Steffens exposed the sordid character of politics in several\\n', 'municipalities in a series of articles bearing the painful heading: _The\\n', 'Shame of the Cities_. The critical spirit appeared in almost every form;\\n', 'in weekly and monthly magazines, in essays and pamphlets, in editorials\\n', \"and news stories, in novels like Churchill's _Coniston_ and Sinclair's\\n\", '_The Jungle_. It became so savage and so wanton that the opening years\\n', 'of the twentieth century were well named \"the age of the muckrakers.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Subjects of the Criticism.=--In this outburst of invective, nothing\\n', 'was spared. It was charged that each of the political parties had fallen\\n', 'into the hands of professional politicians who devoted their time to\\n', 'managing conventions, making platforms, nominating candidates, and\\n', 'dictating to officials; in return for their \"services\" they sold offices\\n', 'and privileges. It was alleged that mayors and councils had bargained\\n', 'away for private benefit street railway and other franchises. It was\\n', 'asserted that many powerful labor unions were dominated by men who\\n', 'blackmailed employers. Some critics specialized in descriptions of the\\n', 'poverty, slums, and misery of great cities. Others took up \"frenzied\\n', 'finance\" and accused financiers of selling worthless stocks and bonds to\\n', 'an innocent public. Still others professed to see in the accumulations\\n', 'of millionaires the downfall of our republic.\\n', '\\n', '=The Attack on \"Invisible Government.\"=--Some even maintained that the\\n', 'control of public affairs had passed from the people to a sinister\\n', 'minority called \"the invisible government.\" So eminent and conservative\\n', 'a statesman as the Hon. Elihu Root lent the weight of his great name to\\n', 'such an imputation. Speaking of his native state, New York, he said:\\n', '\"What is the government of this state? What has it been during the forty\\n', 'years of my acquaintance with it? The government of the Constitution?\\n', 'Oh, no; not half the time or half way.... From the days of Fenton and\\n', 'Conkling and Arthur and Cornell and Platt, from the days of David B.\\n', 'Hill down to the present time, the government of the state has presented\\n', 'two different lines of activity: one, of the constitutional and\\n', 'statutory officers of the state and the other of the party leaders; they\\n', \"call them party bosses. They call the system--I don't coin the\\n\", \"phrase--the system they call 'invisible government.' For I don't know\\n\", 'how many years Mr. Conkling was the supreme ruler in this state. The\\n', 'governor did not count, the legislature did not count, comptrollers and\\n', 'secretaries of state and what not did not count. It was what Mr.\\n', 'Conkling said, and in a great outburst of public rage he was pulled\\n', 'down. Then Mr. Platt ruled the state; for nigh upon twenty years he\\n', 'ruled it. It was not the governor; it was not the legislature; it was\\n', 'Mr. Platt. And the capital was not here [in Albany]; it was at 49\\n', 'Broadway; Mr. Platt and his lieutenants. It makes no difference what\\n', 'name you give, whether you call it Fenton or Conkling or Cornell or\\n', 'Arthur or Platt or by the names of men now living. The ruler of the\\n', 'state during the greater part of the forty years of my acquaintance with\\n', 'the state government has not been any man authorized by the constitution\\n', 'or by law.... The party leader is elected by no one, accountable to no\\n', 'one, bound by no oath of office, removable by no one.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Nation Aroused.=--With the spirit of criticism came also the spirit\\n', 'of reform. The charges were usually exaggerated; often wholly false; but\\n', 'there was enough truth in them to warrant renewed vigilance on the part\\n', 'of American democracy. President Roosevelt doubtless summed up the\\n', 'sentiment of the great majority of citizens when he demanded the\\n', 'punishment of wrong-doers in 1907, saying: \"It makes not a particle of\\n', 'difference whether these crimes are committed by a capitalist or by a\\n', 'laborer, by a leading banker or manufacturer or railroad man or by a\\n', 'leading representative of a labor union. Swindling in stocks, corrupting\\n', 'legislatures, making fortunes by the inflation of securities, by\\n', 'wrecking railroads, by destroying competitors through rebates--these\\n', 'forms of wrong-doing in the capitalist are far more infamous than any\\n', 'ordinary form of embezzlement or forgery.\" The time had come, he added,\\n', 'to stop \"muckraking\" and proceed to the constructive work of removing\\n', 'the abuses that had grown up.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'POLITICAL REFORMS\\n', '\\n', '=The Public Service.=--It was a wise comprehension of the needs of\\n', 'American democracy that led the friends of reform to launch and to\\n', 'sustain for more than half a century a movement to improve the public\\n', 'service. On the one side they struck at the spoils system; at the right\\n', 'of the politicians to use public offices as mere rewards for partisan\\n', 'work. The federal civil service act of 1883 opened the way to reform by\\n', 'establishing five vital principles in law: (1) admission to office, not\\n', 'on the recommendation of party workers, but on the basis of competitive\\n', 'examinations; (2) promotion for meritorious service of the government\\n', 'rather than of parties; (3) no assessment of office holders for campaign\\n', 'funds; (4) permanent tenure during good behavior; and (5) no dismissals\\n', 'for political reasons. The act itself at first applied to only 14,000\\n', 'federal offices, but under the constant pressure from the reformers it\\n', 'was extended until in 1916 it covered nearly 300,000 employees out of an\\n', 'executive force of approximately 414,000. While gaining steadily at\\n', 'Washington, civil service reformers carried their agitation into the\\n', 'states and cities. By 1920 they were able to report ten states with\\n', 'civil service commissions and the merit system well intrenched in more\\n', 'than three hundred municipalities.\\n', '\\n', 'In excluding spoilsmen from public office, the reformers were, in a\\n', 'sense, engaged in a negative work: that of \"keeping the rascals out.\"\\n', 'But there was a second and larger phase to their movement, one\\n', 'constructive in character: that of getting skilled, loyal, and efficient\\n', 'servants into the places of responsibility. Everywhere on land and sea,\\n', 'in town and country, new burdens were laid upon public officers. They\\n', 'were called upon to supervise the ships sailing to and from our ports;\\n', 'to inspect the water and milk supplies of our cities; to construct and\\n', 'operate great public works, such as the Panama and Erie canals; to\\n', 'regulate the complicated rates of railway companies; to safeguard health\\n', 'and safety in a thousand ways; to climb the mountains to fight forest\\n', 'fires; and to descend into the deeps of the earth to combat the deadly\\n', 'coal gases that assail the miners. In a word, those who labored to\\n', 'master the secrets and the powers of nature were summoned to the aid of\\n', 'the government: chemists, engineers, architects, nurses, surgeons,\\n', 'foresters--the skilled in all the sciences, arts, and crafts.\\n', '\\n', 'Keeping rascals out was no task at all compared with the problem of\\n', 'finding competent people for all the technical offices. \"Now,\" said the\\n', 'reformers, \"we must make attractive careers in the government work for\\n', 'the best American talent; we must train those applying for admission and\\n', 'increase the skill of those already in positions of trust; we must see\\n', 'to it that those entering at the bottom have a chance to rise to the\\n', 'top; in short, we must work for a government as skilled and efficient as\\n', 'it is strong, one commanding all the wisdom and talent of America that\\n', 'public welfare requires.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Australian Ballot.=--A second line of attack on the political\\n', 'machines was made in connection with the ballot. In the early days\\n', 'elections were frequently held in the open air and the poll was taken by\\n', 'a show of hands or by the enrollment of the voters under names of their\\n', 'favorite candidates. When this ancient practice was abandoned in favor\\n', 'of the printed ballot, there was still no secrecy about elections. Each\\n', 'party prepared its own ballot, often of a distinctive color, containing\\n', 'the names of its candidates. On election day, these papers were handed\\n', 'out to the voters by party workers. Any one could tell from the color of\\n', 'the ballot dropped into the box, or from some mark on the outside of the\\n', 'folded ballot, just how each man voted. Those who bought votes were sure\\n', 'that their purchases were \"delivered.\" Those who intimidated voters\\n', 'could know when their intimidation was effective. In this way the party\\n', 'ballot strengthened the party machine.\\n', '\\n', 'As a remedy for such abuses, reformers, learning from the experience of\\n', 'Australia, urged the adoption of the \"Australian ballot.\" That ballot,\\n', 'though it appeared in many forms, had certain constant features. It was\\n', 'official, that is, furnished by the government, not by party workers; it\\n', 'contained the names of all candidates of all parties; it was given out\\n', 'only in the polling places; and it was marked in secret. The first state\\n', 'to introduce it was Massachusetts. The year was 1888. Before the end of\\n', 'the century it had been adopted by nearly all the states in the union.\\n', 'The salutary effect of the reform in reducing the amount of cheating\\n', 'and bribery in elections was beyond all question.\\n', '\\n', '=The Direct Primary.=--In connection with the uprising against machine\\n', 'politics, came a call for the abolition of the old method of nominating\\n', 'candidates by conventions. These time-honored party assemblies, which\\n', 'had come down from the days of Andrew Jackson, were, it was said, merely\\n', 'conclaves of party workers, sustained by the spoils system, and\\n', 'dominated by an inner circle of bosses. The remedy offered in this case\\n', 'was again \"more democracy,\" namely, the abolition of the party\\n', 'convention and the adoption of the direct primary. Candidates were no\\n', 'longer to be chosen by secret conferences. Any member of a party was to\\n', 'be allowed to run for any office, to present his name to his party by\\n', 'securing signatures to a petition, and to submit his candidacy to his\\n', 'fellow partisans at a direct primary--an election within the party. In\\n', 'this movement Governor La Follette of Wisconsin took the lead and his\\n', 'state was the first in the union to adopt the direct primary for\\n', 'state-wide purposes. The idea spread, rapidly in the West, more slowly\\n', 'in the East. The public, already angered against \"the bosses,\" grasped\\n', 'eagerly at it. Governor Hughes in New York pressed it upon the unwilling\\n', 'legislature. State after state accepted it until by 1918 Rhode Island,\\n', 'Delaware, Connecticut, and New Mexico were the only states that had not\\n', 'bowed to the storm. Still the results were disappointing and at that\\n', 'very time the pendulum was beginning to swing backward.\\n', '\\n', '=Popular Election of Federal Senators.=--While the movement for direct\\n', 'primaries was still advancing everywhere, a demand for the popular\\n', 'election of Senators, usually associated with it, swept forward to\\n', 'victory. Under the original Constitution, it had been expressly provided\\n', 'that Senators should be chosen by the legislatures of the states. In\\n', 'practice this rule transferred the selection of Senators to secret\\n', 'caucuses of party members in the state legislatures. In connection with\\n', 'these caucuses there had been many scandals, some direct proofs of\\n', 'brazen bribery and corruption, and dark hints besides. The Senate was\\n', 'called by its detractors \"a millionaires\\' club\" and it was looked upon\\n', 'as the \"citadel of conservatism.\" The prescription in this case was\\n', 'likewise \"more democracy\"--direct election of Senators by popular vote.\\n', '\\n', 'This reform was not a new idea. It had been proposed in Congress as\\n', 'early as 1826. President Johnson, an ardent advocate, made it the\\n', 'subject of a special message in 1868 Not long afterward it appeared in\\n', 'Congress. At last in 1893, the year after the great Populist upheaval,\\n', 'the House of Representatives by the requisite two-thirds vote\\n', 'incorporated it in an amendment to the federal Constitution. Again and\\n', 'again it passed the House; but the Senate itself was obdurate. Able\\n', 'Senators leveled their batteries against it. Mr. Hoar of Massachusetts\\n', 'declared that it would transfer the seat of power to the \"great cities\\n', 'and masses of population\"; that it would \"overthrow the whole scheme of\\n', 'the Senate and in the end the whole scheme of the national Constitution\\n', 'as designed and established by the framers of the Constitution and the\\n', 'people who adopted it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Failing in the Senate, advocates of popular election made a rear assault\\n', 'through the states. They induced state legislatures to enact laws\\n', 'requiring the nomination of candidates for the Senate by the direct\\n', 'primary, and then they bound the legislatures to abide by the popular\\n', 'choice. Nevada took the lead in 1899. Shortly afterward Oregon, by the\\n', 'use of the initiative and referendum, practically bound legislators to\\n', 'accept the popular nominee and the country witnessed the spectacle of a\\n', 'Republican legislature \"electing\" a Democrat to represent the state in\\n', 'the Senate at Washington. By 1910 three-fourths of the states had\\n', 'applied the direct primary in some form to the choice of Senators. Men\\n', 'selected by that method began to pour in upon the floors of Congress;\\n', 'finally in 1912 the two-thirds majority was secured for an amendment to\\n', 'the federal Constitution providing for the popular election of Senators.\\n', 'It was quickly ratified by the states. The following year it was\\n', 'proclaimed in effect.\\n', '\\n', '=The Initiative and Referendum.=--As a corrective for the evils which\\n', 'had grown up in state legislatures there arose a demand for the\\n', 'introduction of a Swiss device known as the initiative and referendum.\\n', 'The initiative permits any one to draw up a proposed bill; and, on\\n', 'securing a certain number of signatures among the voters, to require the\\n', 'submission of the measure to the people at an election. If the bill thus\\n', 'initiated receives a sufficient majority, it becomes a law. The\\n', 'referendum allows citizens who disapprove any act passed by the\\n', 'legislature to get up a petition against it and thus bring about a\\n', 'reference of the measure to the voters at the polls for approval or\\n', 'rejection. These two practices constitute a form of \"direct government.\"\\n', '\\n', 'These devices were prescribed \"to restore the government to the people.\"\\n', 'The Populists favored them in their platform of 1896. Mr. Bryan, two\\n', 'years later, made them a part of his program, and in the same year South\\n', 'Dakota adopted them. In 1902 Oregon, after a strenuous campaign, added a\\n', 'direct legislation amendment to the state constitution. Within ten years\\n', 'all the Southwestern, Mountain, and Pacific states, except Texas and\\n', 'Wyoming, had followed this example. To the east of the Mississippi,\\n', 'however, direct legislation met a chilly reception. By 1920 only five\\n', 'states in this section had accepted it: Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio,\\n', 'Michigan, and Maryland, the last approving the referendum only.\\n', '\\n', '=The Recall.=--Executive officers and judges, as well as legislatures,\\n', 'had come in for their share of criticism, and it was proposed that they\\n', 'should likewise be subjected to a closer scrutiny by the public. For\\n', 'this purpose there was advanced a scheme known as the recall--which\\n', 'permitted a certain percentage of the voters to compel any officer, at\\n', 'any time during his term, to go before the people at a new election.\\n', 'This feature of direct government, tried out first in the city of Los\\n', 'Angeles, was extended to state-wide uses in Oregon in 1908. It failed,\\n', 'however, to capture popular imagination to the same degree as the\\n', \"initiative and referendum. At the end of ten years' agitation, only ten\\n\", 'states, mainly in the West, had adopted it for general purposes, and\\n', 'four of them did not apply it to the judges of the courts. Still it was\\n', 'extensively acclaimed in cities and incorporated into hundreds of\\n', 'municipal laws and charters.\\n', '\\n', 'As a general proposition, direct government in all its forms was\\n', 'bitterly opposed by men of a conservative cast of mind. It was denounced\\n', 'by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge as \"nothing less than a complete revolution\\n', 'in the fabric of our government and in the fundamental principles upon\\n', 'which that government rests.\" In his opinion, it promised to break down\\n', 'the representative principle and \"undermine and overthrow the bulwarks\\n', 'of ordered liberty and individual freedom.\" Mr. Taft shared Mr. Lodge\\'s\\n', 'views and spoke of direct government with scorn. \"Votes,\" he exclaimed,\\n', '\"are not bread ... referendums do not pay rent or furnish houses,\\n', 'recalls do not furnish clothes, initiatives do not supply employment or\\n', 'relieve inequalities of condition or of opportunity.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Commission Government for Cities.=--In the restless searching out of\\n', 'evils, the management of cities early came under critical scrutiny. City\\n', 'government, Mr. Bryce had remarked, was the one conspicuous failure in\\n', 'America. This sharp thrust, though resented by some, was accepted as a\\n', 'warning by others. Many prescriptions were offered by doctors of the\\n', 'body politic. Chief among them was the idea of simplifying the city\\n', 'government so that the light of public scrutiny could shine through it.\\n', '\"Let us elect only a few men and make them clearly responsible for the\\n', 'city government!\" was the new cry in municipal reform. So, many city\\n', 'councils were reduced in size; one of the two houses, which several\\n', 'cities had adopted in imitation of the federal government, was\\n', 'abolished; and in order that the mayor could be held to account, he was\\n', 'given the power to appoint all the chief officials. This made the mayor,\\n', 'in some cases, the only elective city official and gave the voters a\\n', '\"short ballot\" containing only a few names--an idea which some proposed\\n', 'to apply also to the state government.\\n', '\\n', 'A further step in the concentration of authority was taken in Galveston,\\n', 'Texas, where the people, looking upon the ruin of their city wrought by\\n', 'the devastating storm of 1901, and confronted by the difficult problems\\n', 'of reconstruction, felt the necessity for a more businesslike management\\n', 'of city affairs and instituted a new form of local administration. They\\n', 'abolished the old scheme of mayor and council and vested all power in\\n', 'five commissioners, one of whom, without any special prerogatives, was\\n', 'assigned to the office of \"mayor president.\" In 1908, the commission\\n', 'form of government, as it was soon characterized, was adopted by Des\\n', 'Moines, Iowa. The attention of all municipal reformers was drawn to it\\n', 'and it was hailed as the guarantee of a better day. By 1920, more than\\n', 'four hundred cities, including Memphis, Spokane, Birmingham, Newark, and\\n', 'Buffalo, had adopted it. Still the larger cities like New York and\\n', 'Chicago kept their boards of aldermen.\\n', '\\n', \"=The City Manager Plan.=--A few years' experience with commission\\n\", 'government revealed certain patent defects. The division of the work\\n', 'among five men was frequently found to introduce dissensions and\\n', 'irresponsibility. Commissioners were often lacking in the technical\\n', 'ability required to manage such difficult matters as fire and police\\n', 'protection, public health, public works, and public utilities. Some one\\n', 'then proposed to carry over into city government an idea from the\\n', 'business world. In that sphere the stockholders of each corporation\\n', 'elect the directors and the directors, in turn, choose a business\\n', 'manager to conduct the affairs of the company. It was suggested that the\\n', 'city commissioners, instead of attempting to supervise the details of\\n', 'the city administration, should select a manager to do this. The scheme\\n', 'was put into effect in Sumter, South Carolina, in 1912. Like the\\n', 'commission plan, it became popular. Within eight years more than one\\n', 'hundred and fifty towns and cities had adopted it. Among the larger\\n', 'municipalities were Dayton, Springfield (Ohio), Akron, Kalamazoo, and\\n', 'Phoenix. It promised to create a new public service profession, that of\\n', 'city manager.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'MEASURES OF ECONOMIC REFORM\\n', '\\n', '=The Spirit of American Reform.=--The purification of the ballot, the\\n', 'restriction of the spoils system, the enlargement of direct popular\\n', 'control over the organs of government were not the sole answers made by\\n', 'the reformers to the critics of American institutions. Nor were they the\\n', 'most important. In fact, they were regarded not as ends in themselves,\\n', 'but as means to serve a wider purpose. That purpose was the promotion of\\n', 'the \"general welfare.\" The concrete objects covered by that broad term\\n', 'were many and varied; but they included the prevention of extortion by\\n', 'railway and other corporations, the protection of public health, the\\n', 'extension of education, the improvement of living conditions in the\\n', 'cities, the elimination of undeserved poverty, the removal of gross\\n', 'inequalities in wealth, and more equality of opportunity.\\n', '\\n', 'All these things involved the use of the powers of government. Although\\n', 'a few clung to the ancient doctrine that the government should not\\n', 'interfere with private business at all, the American people at large\\n', 'rejected that theory as vigorously as they rejected the doctrines of an\\n', 'extreme socialism which exalts the state above the individual. Leaders\\n', 'representing every shade of opinion proclaimed the government an\\n', 'instrument of common welfare to be used in the public interest. \"We must\\n', 'abandon definitely,\" said Roosevelt, \"the _laissez-faire_ theory of\\n', 'political economy and fearlessly champion a system of increased\\n', 'governmental control, paying no attention to the cries of worthy people\\n', 'who denounce this as socialistic.\" This view was shared by Mr. Taft, who\\n', 'observed: \"Undoubtedly the government can wisely do much more ... to\\n', 'relieve the oppressed, to create greater equality of opportunity, to\\n', 'make reasonable terms for labor in employment, and to furnish vocational\\n', 'education.\" He was quick to add his caution that \"there is a line beyond\\n', 'which the government cannot go with any good practical results in\\n', 'seeking to make men and society better.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Regulation of Railways.=--The first attempts to use the government\\n', 'in a large way to control private enterprise in the public interest were\\n', 'made by the Northwestern states in the decade between 1870 and 1880.\\n', 'Charges were advanced by the farmers, particularly those organized into\\n', 'Granges, that the railways extorted the highest possible rates for\\n', 'freight and passengers, that favoritism was shown to large shippers,\\n', 'that fraudulent stocks and bonds were sold to the innocent public. It\\n', 'was claimed that railways were not like other enterprises, but were\\n', '\"quasi-public\" concerns, like the roads and ferries, and thus subject to\\n', 'government control. Accordingly laws were enacted bringing the railroads\\n', 'under state supervision. In some cases the state legislature fixed the\\n', 'maximum rates to be charged by common carriers, and in other cases\\n', 'commissions were created with the power to establish the rates after an\\n', 'investigation. This legislation was at first denounced in the East as\\n', 'nothing less than the \"confiscation\" of the railways in the interest of\\n', 'the farmers. Attempts to have the Supreme Court of the United States\\n', 'declare it unconstitutional were made without avail; still a principle\\n', 'was finally laid down to the effect that in fixing rates state\\n', 'legislatures and commissions must permit railway companies to earn a\\n', '\"fair\" return on the capital invested.\\n', '\\n', 'In a few years the Granger spirit appeared in Congress. An investigation\\n', 'revealed a long list of abuses committed by the railways against\\n', 'shippers and travelers. The result was the interstate commerce act of\\n', '1887, which created the Interstate Commerce Commission, forbade\\n', 'discriminations in rates, and prohibited other objectionable practices\\n', 'on the part of railways. This measure was loosely enforced and the\\n', 'abuses against which it was directed continued almost unabated. A demand\\n', 'for stricter control grew louder and louder. Congress was forced to\\n', 'heed. In 1903 it enacted the Elkins law, forbidding railways to charge\\n', 'rates other than those published, and laid penalties upon the officers\\n', 'and agents of companies, who granted secret favors to shippers, and upon\\n', 'shippers who accepted them. Three years later a still more drastic step\\n', 'was taken by the passage of the Hepburn act. The Interstate Commerce\\n', 'Commission was authorized, upon complaint of some party aggrieved, and\\n', 'after a public hearing, to determine whether just and reasonable rates\\n', 'had been charged by the companies. In effect, the right to fix freight\\n', 'and passenger rates was taken out of the hands of the owners of the\\n', 'railways engaged in interstate commerce and vested in the hands of the\\n', 'Interstate Commerce Commission. Thus private property to the value of\\n', '$20,000,000,000 or more was declared to be a matter of public concern\\n', 'and subject to government regulation in the common interest.\\n', '\\n', '=Municipal Utilities.=--Similar problems arose in connection with the\\n', 'street railways, electric light plants, and other utilities in the great\\n', 'cities. In the beginning the right to construct such undertakings was\\n', 'freely, and often corruptly, granted to private companies by city\\n', 'councils. Distressing abuses arose in connection with such practices.\\n', 'Many grants or franchises were made perpetual, or perhaps for a term of\\n', '999 years. The rates charged and services rendered were left largely to\\n', 'the will of the companies holding the franchises. Mergers or unions of\\n', 'companies were common and the public was deluged with stocks and bonds\\n', 'of doubtful value; bankruptcies were frequent. The connection between\\n', 'the utility companies and the politicians was, to say the least, not\\n', 'always in the public interest.\\n', '\\n', 'American ingenuity was quick to devise methods for eliminating such\\n', 'evils. Three lines of progress were laid out by the reformers. One group\\n', 'proposed that such utilities should be subject to municipal or state\\n', 'regulation, that the formation of utility companies should be under\\n', 'public control, and that the issue of stocks and bonds must be approved\\n', 'by public authority. In some cases state, and in other cases municipal,\\n', 'commissions were created to exercise this great power over \"quasi-public\\n', 'corporations.\" Wisconsin, by laws enacted in 1907, put all heat, light,\\n', 'water works, telephone, and street railway companies under the\\n', 'supervision of a single railway commission. Other states followed this\\n', 'example rapidly. By 1920 the principle of public control over municipal\\n', 'utilities was accepted in nearly every section of the union.\\n', '\\n', 'A second line of reform appeared in the \"model franchise\" for utility\\n', 'corporations. An illustration of this tendency was afforded by the\\n', 'Chicago street railway settlement of 1906. The total capital of the\\n', 'company was fixed at a definite sum, its earnings were agreed upon, and\\n', 'the city was given the right to buy and operate the system if it desired\\n', 'to do so. In many states, about the same time, it was provided that no\\n', 'franchises to utility companies could run more than twenty-five years.\\n', '\\n', 'A third group of reformers were satisfied with nothing short of\\n', 'municipal ownership. They proposed to drive private companies entirely\\n', 'out of the field and vest the ownership and management of municipal\\n', 'plants in the city itself. This idea was extensively applied to electric\\n', 'light and water works plants, but to street railways in only a few\\n', 'cities, including San Francisco and Seattle. In New York the subways are\\n', 'owned by the city but leased for operation.\\n', '\\n', '=Tenement House Control.=--Among the other pressing problems of the\\n', 'cities was the overcrowding in houses unfit for habitation. An inquiry\\n', 'in New York City made under the authority of the state in 1902 revealed\\n', 'poverty, misery, slums, dirt, and disease almost beyond imagination. The\\n', 'immediate answer was the enactment of a tenement house law prescribing\\n', 'in great detail the size of the rooms, the air space, the light and the\\n', 'sanitary arrangement for all new buildings. An immense improvement\\n', 'followed and the idea was quickly taken up in other states having large\\n', 'industrial centers. In 1920 New York made a further invasion of the\\n', 'rights of landlords by assuring to the public \"reasonable rents\" for\\n', 'flats and apartments.\\n', '\\n', \"=Workmen's Compensation.=--No small part of the poverty in cities was\\n\", 'due to the injury of wage-earners while at their trade. Every year the\\n', 'number of men and women killed or wounded in industry mounted higher.\\n', 'Under the old law, the workman or his family had to bear the loss unless\\n', 'the employer had been guilty of some extraordinary negligence. Even in\\n', 'that case an expensive lawsuit was usually necessary to recover\\n', '\"damages.\" In short, although employers insured their buildings and\\n', 'machinery against necessary risks from fire and storm, they allowed\\n', 'their employees to assume the heavy losses due to accidents. The\\n', 'injustice of this, though apparent enough now, was once not generally\\n', 'recognized. It was said to be unfair to make the employer pay for\\n', 'injuries for which he was not personally responsible; but the argument\\n', 'was overborne.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: AN EAST SIDE STREET IN NEW YORK]\\n', '\\n', 'About 1910 there set in a decided movement in the direction of lifting\\n', 'the burden of accidents from the unfortunate victims. In the first\\n', 'place, laws were enacted requiring employers to pay damages in certain\\n', 'amounts according to the nature of the case, no matter how the accident\\n', 'occurred, as long as the injured person was not guilty of willful\\n', 'negligence. By 1914 more than one-half the states had such laws. In the\\n', 'second place, there developed schemes of industrial insurance in the\\n', 'form of automatic grants made by state commissions to persons injured in\\n', 'industries, the funds to be provided by the employers or the state or by\\n', 'both. By 1917 thirty-six states had legislation of this type.\\n', '\\n', \"=Minimum Wages and Mothers' Pensions.=--Another source of poverty,\\n\", 'especially among women and children, was found to be the low wages paid\\n', 'for their labor. Report after report showed this. In 1912 Massachusetts\\n', 'took a significant step in the direction of declaring the minimum wages\\n', 'which might be paid to women and children. Oregon, the following year,\\n', 'created a commission with power to prescribe minimum wages in certain\\n', 'industries, based on the cost of living, and to enforce the rates fixed.\\n', 'Within a short time one-third of the states had legislation of this\\n', 'character. To cut away some of the evils of poverty and enable widows to\\n', 'keep their homes intact and bring up their children, a device known as\\n', \"mothers' pensions became popular during the second decade of the\\n\", 'twentieth century. At the opening of 1913 two states, Colorado and\\n', 'Illinois, had laws authorizing the payment from public funds of definite\\n', 'sums to widows with children. Within four years, thirty-five states had\\n', 'similar legislation.\\n', '\\n', '=Taxation and Great Fortunes.=--As a part of the campaign waged against\\n', 'poverty by reformers there came a demand for heavy taxes upon great\\n', 'fortunes, particularly taxes upon inheritances or estates passing to\\n', 'heirs on the decease of the owners. Roosevelt was an ardent champion of\\n', 'this type of taxation and dwelt upon it at length in his message to\\n', 'Congress in 1907. \"Such a tax,\" he said, \"would help to preserve a\\n', 'measurable equality of opportunity for the people of the generations\\n', 'growing to manhood.... Our aim is to recognize what Lincoln pointed out:\\n', 'the fact that there are some respects in which men are obviously not\\n', 'equal; but also to insist that there should be equality of self-respect\\n', 'and of mutual respect, an equality of rights before the law, and at\\n', 'least an approximate equality in the conditions under which each man\\n', 'obtains the chance to show the stuff that is in him when compared with\\n', 'his fellows.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The spirit of the new age was, therefore, one of reform, not of\\n', 'revolution. It called for no evolutionary or utopian experiments, but\\n', 'for the steady and progressive enactment of measures aimed at admitted\\n', 'abuses and designed to accomplish tangible results in the name of public\\n', 'welfare.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=General References=\\n', '\\n', 'J.

They served on committees that inquired into the\\n', 'problems of the day; they appeared before legislative assemblies to\\n', 'advocate remedies for the evils they discovered. By 1912 they were a\\n', 'force to be reckoned with in national politics. In nine states complete\\n', 'and equal suffrage had been established, and a widespread campaign for a\\n', 'national suffrage amendment was in full swing. On every hand lay\\n', 'evidences that their sphere had been broadened to include public\\n', 'affairs. This was the culmination of forces that had long been\\n', 'operating.\\n', '\\n', '=A New Emphasis in History.=--A movement so deeply affecting important\\n', 'interests could not fail to find a place in time in the written record\\n', 'of human progress. History often began as a chronicle of kings and\\n', 'queens, knights and ladies, written partly to amuse and partly to\\n', 'instruct the classes that appeared in its pages. With the growth of\\n', 'commerce, parliaments, and international relations, politics and\\n', 'diplomacy were added to such chronicles of royal and princely doings.\\n', 'After the rise of democracy, industry, and organized labor, the\\n', 'transactions of everyday life were deemed worthy of a place in the pages\\n', 'of history. In each case history was rewritten and the past rediscovered\\n', 'in the light of the new age. So it will be with the rise and growth of\\n', \"women's political power. The history of their labor, their education,\\n\", 'their status in society, their influence on the course of events will be\\n', 'explored and given its place in the general record.\\n', '\\n', 'It will be a history of change. The superior position which women enjoy\\n', 'in America to-day is the result of a slow evolution from an almost\\n', 'rightless condition in colonial times. The founders of America brought\\n', \"with them the English common law. Under that law, a married woman's\\n\", 'personal property--jewels, money, furniture, and the like--became her\\n', \"husband's property; the management of her lands passed into his control.\\n\", 'Even the wages she earned, if she worked for some one else, belonged to\\n', 'him. Custom, if not law, prescribed that women should not take part in\\n', 'town meetings or enter into public discussions of religious questions.\\n', 'Indeed it is a far cry from the banishment of Anne Hutchinson from\\n', 'Massachusetts in 1637, for daring to dispute with the church fathers, to\\n', 'the political conventions of 1920 in which women sat as delegates, made\\n', 'nominating speeches, and served on committees. In the contrast between\\n', 'these two scenes may be measured the change in the privileges of women\\n', 'since the landing of the Pilgrims. The account of this progress is a\\n', 'narrative of individual effort on the part of women, of organizations\\n', 'among them, of generous aid from sympathetic men in the long agitation\\n', 'for the removal of civil and political disabilities. It is in part also\\n', 'a narrative of irresistible economic change which drew women into\\n', 'industry, created a leisure class, gave women wages and incomes, and\\n', 'therewith economic independence.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE RISE OF THE WOMAN MOVEMENT\\n', '\\n', '=Protests of Colonial Women.=--The republican spirit which produced\\n', 'American independence was of slow and steady growth. It did not spring\\n', 'up full-armed in a single night. It was, on the contrary, nourished\\n', 'during a long period of time by fireside discussions as well as by\\n', 'debates in the public forum. Women shared that fireside sifting of\\n', 'political principles and passed on the findings of that scrutiny in\\n', 'letters to their friends, newspaper articles, and every form of written\\n', 'word. How widespread was this potent, though not spectacular force, is\\n', \"revealed in the collections of women's letters, articles, songs, dramas,\\n\", 'and satirical \"skits\" on English rule that have come down to us. In this\\n', 'search into the reasons of government, some women began to take thought\\n', 'about laws that excluded them from the ballot. Two women at least left\\n', 'their protests on record. Abigail, the ingenious and witty wife of John\\n', 'Adams, wrote to her husband, in March, 1776, that women objected \"to all\\n', 'arbitrary power whether of state or males\" and demanded political\\n', 'privileges in the new order then being created. Hannah Lee Corbin, the\\n', 'sister of \"Lighthorse\" Harry Lee, protested to her brother against the\\n', 'taxation of women without representation.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: ABIGAIL ADAMS]\\n', '\\n', '=The Stir among European Women.=--Ferment in America, in the case of\\n', 'women as of men, was quickened by events in Europe. In 1792, Mary\\n', 'Wollstonecraft published in England the _Vindication of the Rights of\\n', 'Women_--a book that was destined to serve the cause of liberty among\\n', 'women as the writings of Locke and Paine had served that of men. The\\n', \"specific grievances which stirred English women were men's invasion of\\n\", \"women's industries, such as spinning and weaving; the denial of equal\\n\", 'educational opportunities; and political disabilities. In France also\\n', 'the great Revolution raised questionings about the status of women. The\\n', 'rights of \"citizenesses\" as well as the rights of \"citizens\" were\\n', 'examined by the boldest thinkers. This in turn reacted upon women in the\\n', 'United States.\\n', '\\n', '=Leadership in America.=--The origins of the American woman movement are\\n', 'to be found in the writings of a few early intellectual leaders. During\\n', 'the first decades of the nineteenth century, books, articles, and\\n', 'pamphlets about women came in increasing numbers from the press. Lydia\\n', 'Maria Child wrote a history of women; Margaret Fuller made a critical\\n', 'examination of the status of women in her time; and Mrs. Elizabeth Ellet\\n', 'supplemented the older histories by showing what an important part women\\n', 'had played in the American Revolution.\\n', '\\n', '=The Struggle for Education.=--Along with criticism, there was carried\\n', 'on a constructive struggle for better educational facilities for women\\n', 'who had been from the beginning excluded from every college in the\\n', 'country. In this long battle, Emma Willard and Mary Lyon led the way;\\n', 'the former founded a seminary at Troy, New York; and the latter made the\\n', 'beginnings of Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. Oberlin College in\\n', 'Ohio, established in 1833, opened its doors to girls and from it were\\n', 'graduated young students to lead in the woman movement. Sarah J. Hale,\\n', 'who in 1827 became the editor of a \"Ladies\\' Magazine,\" published in\\n', 'Boston, conducted a campaign for equal educational opportunities which\\n', 'helped to bear fruit in the founding of Vassar College shortly after the\\n', 'Civil War.\\n', '\\n', '=The Desire to Effect Reforms.=--As they came to study their own history\\n', 'and their own part in civilization, women naturally became deeply\\n', 'interested in all the controversies going on around them. The temperance\\n', 'question made a special appeal to them and they organized to demand the\\n', 'right to be heard on it. In 1846 the \"Daughters of Temperance\" formed a\\n', 'secret society favoring prohibition. They dared to criticize the\\n', 'churches for their indifference and were so bold as to ask that\\n', 'drunkenness be made a ground for divorce.\\n', '\\n', 'The slavery issue even more than temperance called women into public\\n', 'life. The Grimke sisters of South Carolina emancipated their bondmen,\\n', 'and one of these sisters, exiled from Charleston for her \"Appeal to the\\n', 'Christian Women of the South,\" went North to work against the slavery\\n', \"system. In 1837 the National Women's Anti-Slavery Convention met in New\\n\", 'York; seventy-one women delegates represented eight states. Three years\\n', 'later eight American women, five of them in Quaker costume, attended the\\n', 'World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, much to the horror of the men,\\n', 'who promptly excluded them from the sessions on the ground that it was\\n', 'not fitting for women to take part in such meetings.\\n', '\\n', 'In other spheres of activity, especially social service, women steadily\\n', 'enlarged their interest. Nothing human did they consider alien to them.\\n', 'They inveighed against cruel criminal laws and unsanitary prisons. They\\n', 'organized poor relief and led in private philanthropy. Dorothea Dix\\n', 'directed the movement that induced the New York legislature to establish\\n', 'in 1845 a separate asylum for the criminal insane. In the same year\\n', 'Sarah G. Bagley organized the Lowell Female Reform Association for the\\n', 'purpose of reducing the long hours of labor for women, safeguarding \"the\\n', 'constitutions of future generations.\" Mrs. Eliza Woodson Farnham, matron\\n', 'in Sing Sing penitentiary, was known throughout the nation for her\\n', 'social work, especially prison reform. Wherever there were misery and\\n', 'suffering, women were preparing programs of relief.\\n', '\\n', '=Freedom of Speech for Women.=--In the advancement of their causes, of\\n', 'whatever kind, women of necessity had to make public appeals and take\\n', 'part in open meetings. Here they encountered difficulties. The\\n', 'appearance of women on the platform was new and strange. Naturally it\\n', 'was widely resented. Antoinette Brown, although she had credentials as a\\n', 'delegate, was driven off the platform of a temperance convention in New\\n', 'York City simply because she was a woman. James Russell Lowell, editor\\n', 'of the \"Atlantic Monthly,\" declined a poem from Julia Ward Howe on the\\n', 'theory that no woman could write a poem; but he added on second thought\\n', 'that he might consider an article in prose. Nathaniel Hawthorne,\\n', 'another editor, even objected to something in prose because to him \"all\\n', 'ink-stained women were equally detestable.\" To the natural resentment\\n', 'against their intrusion into new fields was added that aroused by their\\n', 'ideas and methods. As temperance reformers, they criticized in a caustic\\n', 'manner those who would not accept their opinions. As opponents of\\n', 'slavery they were especially bitter. One of their conventions, held at\\n', 'Philadelphia in 1833, passed a resolution calling on all women to leave\\n', 'those churches that would not condemn every form of human bondage. This\\n', 'stirred against them many of the clergy who, accustomed to having women\\n', 'sit silent during services, were in no mood to treat such a revolt\\n', 'leniently. Then came the last straw. Women decided that they would\\n', 'preach--out of the pulpit first, and finally in it.\\n', '\\n', '=Women in Industry.=--The period of this ferment was also the age of the\\n', 'industrial revolution in America, the rise of the factory system, and\\n', 'the growth of mill towns. The labor of women was transferred from the\\n', 'homes to the factories. Then arose many questions: the hours of labor,\\n', 'the sanitary conditions of the mills, the pressure of foreign\\n', 'immigration on native labor, the wages of women as compared with those\\n', 'of men, and the right of married women to their own earnings. Labor\\n', 'organizations sprang up among working women. The mill girls of Lowell,\\n', 'Massachusetts, mainly the daughters of New England farmers, published a\\n', 'magazine, \"The Lowell Offering.\" So excellent were their writings that\\n', 'the French statesman, Thiers, carried a copy of their paper into the\\n', 'Chamber of Deputies to show what working women could achieve in a\\n', 'republic. As women were now admittedly earning their own way in the\\n', 'world by their own labor, they began to talk of their \"economic\\n', 'independence.\"\\n', '\\n', \"=The World Shaken by Revolution.=--Such was the quickening of women's\\n\", 'minds in 1848 when the world was startled once more by a revolution in\\n', 'France which spread to Germany, Poland, Austria, Hungary, and Italy.\\n', 'Once more the people of the earth began to explore the principles of\\n', 'democracy and expound human rights. Women, now better educated and more\\n', '\"advanced\" in their ideas, played a role of still greater importance in\\n', 'that revolution. They led in agitations and uprisings. They suffered\\n', 'from reaction and persecution. From their prison in France, two of them\\n', \"who had been jailed for too much insistence on women's rights exchanged\\n\", 'greetings with American women who were raising the same issue here. By\\n', 'this time the women had more supporters among the men. Horace Greeley,\\n', 'editor of the New York _Tribune_, though he afterwards recanted, used\\n', 'his powerful pen in their behalf. Anti-slavery leaders welcomed their\\n', 'aid and repaid them by urging the enfranchisement of women.\\n', '\\n', \"=The Woman's Rights Convention of 1848.=--The forces, moral and\\n\", 'intellectual, which had been stirring among women, crystallized a few\\n', 'months after the outbreak of the European revolution in the first\\n', \"Woman's Rights Convention in the history of America. It met at Seneca\\n\", 'Falls, New York, in 1848, on the call of Lucretia Mott, Martha Wright,\\n', 'Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Mary Ann McClintock, three of them Quakers.\\n', 'Accustomed to take part in church meetings with men, the Quakers\\n', 'naturally suggested that men as well as women be invited to attend the\\n', 'convention. Indeed, a man presided over the conference, for that\\n', 'position seemed too presumptuous even for such stout advocates of\\n', \"woman's rights.\\n\", '\\n', 'The deliberations of the Seneca Falls convention resulted in a\\n', 'Declaration of Rights modeled after the Declaration of Independence. For\\n', 'example, the preamble began: \"When in the course of human events it\\n', 'becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among\\n', 'the people of the earth a position different from that which they have\\n', 'hitherto occupied....\" So also it closed: \"Such has been the patient\\n', 'suffering of women under this government and such is now the necessity\\n', 'which constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are\\n', 'entitled.\" Then followed the list of grievances, the same number which\\n', 'had been exhibited to George III in 1776. Especially did they assail the\\n', 'disabilities imposed upon them by the English common law imported into\\n', 'America--the law which denied married women their property, their wages,\\n', 'and their legal existence as separate persons. All these grievances they\\n', 'recited to \"a candid world.\" The remedies for the evils which they\\n', 'endured were then set forth in detail. They demanded \"equal rights\" in\\n', 'the colleges, trades, and professions; equal suffrage; the right to\\n', 'share in all political offices, honors, and emoluments; the right to\\n', 'complete equality in marriage, including equal guardianship of the\\n', 'children; and for married women the right to own property, to keep\\n', 'wages, to make contracts, to transact business, and to testify in the\\n', 'courts of justice. In short, they declared women to be persons as men\\n', 'are persons and entitled to all the rights and privileges of human\\n', 'beings. Such was the clarion call which went forth to the world in\\n', '1848--to an amused and contemptuous world, it must be admitted--but to a\\n', 'world fated to heed and obey.\\n', '\\n', '=The First Gains in Civil Liberty.=--The convention of 1848 did not make\\n', 'political enfranchisement the leading issue. Rather did it emphasize the\\n', 'civil disabilities of women which were most seriously under discussion\\n', 'at the time. Indeed, the New York legislature of that very year, as the\\n', \"result of a twelve years' agitation, passed the Married Woman's Property\\n\", 'Act setting aside the general principles of the English common law as\\n', 'applied to women and giving them many of the \"rights of man.\" California\\n', 'and Wisconsin followed in 1850; Massachusetts in 1854; and Kansas in\\n', \"1859. Other states soon fell into line. Women's earnings and\\n\", 'inheritances were at last their own in some states at least. In a little\\n', 'while laws were passed granting women rights as equal guardians of their\\n', 'children and permitting them to divorce their husbands on the grounds of\\n', 'cruelty and drunkenness.\\n', '\\n', \"By degrees other steps were taken. The Woman's Medical College of\\n\", 'Pennsylvania was founded in 1850, and the Philadelphia School of Design\\n', \"for Women three years later. In 1852 the American Women's Educational\\n\", 'Association was formed to initiate an agitation for enlarged\\n', 'educational opportunities for women. Other colleges soon emulated the\\n', 'example of Oberlin: the University of Utah in 1850; Hillsdale College in\\n', 'Michigan in 1855; Baker University in Kansas in 1858; and the University\\n', 'of Iowa in 1860. New trades and professions were opened to women and old\\n', 'prejudices against their activities and demands slowly gave way.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE NATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE\\n', '\\n', '=The Beginnings of Organization.=--As women surmounted one obstacle\\n', 'after another, the agitation for equal suffrage came to the front. If\\n', 'any year is to be fixed as the date of its beginning, it may very well\\n', 'be 1850, when the suffragists of Ohio urged the state constitutional\\n', 'convention to confer the vote upon them. With apparent spontaneity there\\n', 'were held in the same year state suffrage conferences in Indiana,\\n', 'Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts; and connections were formed among the\\n', 'leaders of these meetings. At the same time the first national suffrage\\n', 'convention was held in Worcester, Massachusetts, on the call of\\n', 'eighty-nine leading men and women representing six states. Accounts of\\n', 'the convention were widely circulated in this country and abroad.\\n', 'English women,--for instance, Harriet Martineau,--sent words of\\n', 'appreciation for the work thus inaugurated. It inspired a leading\\n', 'article in the \"Westminster Review,\" which deeply interested the\\n', 'distinguished economist, John Stuart Mill. Soon he was the champion of\\n', 'woman suffrage in the British Parliament and the author of a powerful\\n', 'tract _The Subjection of Women_, widely read throughout the\\n', 'English-speaking world. Thus do world movements grow. Strange to relate\\n', 'the women of England were enfranchised before the adoption of the\\n', 'federal suffrage amendment in America.\\n', '\\n', 'The national suffrage convention of 1850 was followed by an\\n', 'extraordinary outburst of agitation. Pamphlets streamed from the press.\\n', 'Petitions to legislative bodies were drafted, signed, and presented.\\n', 'There were addresses by favorite orators like Garrison, Phillips, and\\n', 'Curtis, and lectures and poems by men like Emerson, Longfellow, and\\n', 'Whittier. In 1853 the first suffrage paper was founded by the wife of a\\n', 'member of Congress from Rhode Island. By this time the last barrier to\\n', \"white manhood suffrage in the North had been swept away and the woman's\\n\", 'movement was gaining momentum every year.\\n', '\\n', '=The Suffrage Movement Checked by the Civil War.=--Advocates of woman\\n', 'suffrage believed themselves on the high road to success when the Civil\\n', 'War engaged the energies and labors of the nation. Northern women became\\n', 'absorbed in the struggle to preserve the union. They held no suffrage\\n', 'conventions for five years. They transformed their associations into\\n', 'Loyalty Leagues. They banded together to buy only domestic goods when\\n', 'foreign imports threatened to ruin American markets. They rolled up\\n', 'monster petitions in favor of the emancipation of slaves. In hospitals,\\n', 'in military prisons, in agriculture, and in industry they bore their\\n', 'full share of responsibility. Even when the New York legislature took\\n', 'advantage of their unguarded moments and repealed the law giving the\\n', 'mother equal rights with the father in the guardianship of children,\\n', 'they refused to lay aside war work for agitation. As in all other wars,\\n', 'their devotion was unstinted and their sacrifices equal to the\\n', 'necessities of the hour.\\n', '\\n', '=The Federal Suffrage Amendment.=--Their plans and activities, when the\\n', 'war closed, were shaped by events beyond their control. The emancipation\\n', 'of the slaves and their proposed enfranchisement made prominent the\\n', 'question of a national suffrage for the first time in our history.\\n', 'Friends of the colored man insisted that his civil liberties would not\\n', 'be safe unless he was granted the right to vote. The woman suffragists\\n', 'very pertinently asked why the same principle did not apply to women.\\n', 'The answer which they received was negative. The fourteenth amendment to\\n', 'the federal Constitution, adopted in 1868, definitely put women aside by\\n', 'limiting the scope of its application, so far as the suffrage was\\n', 'concerned, to the male sex. In making manhood suffrage national,\\n', 'however, it nationalized the issue.\\n', '\\n', 'This was the signal for the advocates of woman suffrage. In March, 1869,\\n', 'their proposed amendment was introduced in Congress by George W. Julian\\n', 'of Indiana. It provided that no citizen should be deprived of the vote\\n', 'on account of sex, following the language of the fifteenth amendment\\n', 'which forbade disfranchisement on account of race. Support for the\\n', 'amendment, coming from many directions, led the suffragists to believe\\n', 'that their case was hopeful. In their platform of 1872, for example, the\\n', 'Republicans praised the women for their loyal devotion to freedom,\\n', 'welcomed them to spheres of wider usefulness, and declared that the\\n', 'demand of any class of citizens for additional rights deserved\\n', '\"respectful consideration.\"\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'SUSAN B. ANTHONY]\\n', '\\n', 'Experience soon demonstrated, however, that praise was not the ballot.\\n', 'Indeed the suffragists already had realized that a tedious contest lay\\n', 'before them. They had revived in 1866 their regular national convention.\\n', 'They gave the name of \"The Revolution\" to their paper, edited by\\n', 'Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. They formed a national\\n', 'suffrage association and organized annual pilgrimages to Congress to\\n', 'present their claims. Such activities bore some results. Many eminent\\n', 'congressmen were converted to their cause and presented it ably to their\\n', 'colleagues of both chambers. Still the subject was ridiculed by the\\n', 'newspapers and looked upon as freakish by the masses.\\n', '\\n', '=The State Campaigns.=--Discouraged by the outcome of the national\\n', 'campaign, suffragists turned to the voters of the individual states and\\n', 'sought the ballot at their hands. Gains by this process were painfully\\n', 'slow. Wyoming, it is true, while still a territory, granted suffrage to\\n', 'women in 1869 and continued it on becoming a state twenty years later,\\n', 'in spite of strong protests in Congress. In 1893 Colorado established\\n', 'complete political equality. In Utah, the third suffrage state, the\\n', 'cause suffered many vicissitudes. Women were enfranchised by the\\n', 'territorial legislature; they were deprived of the ballot by Congress in\\n', '1887; finally in 1896 on the admission of Utah to the union they\\n', 'recovered their former rights. During the same year, 1896, Idaho\\n', 'conferred equal suffrage upon the women. This was the last suffrage\\n', 'victory for more than a decade.\\n', '\\n', '=The Suffrage Cause in Congress.=--In the midst of the meager gains\\n', 'among the states there were occasional flurries of hope for immediate\\n', 'action on the federal amendment. Between 1878 and 1896 the Senate\\n', 'committee reported the suffrage resolution by a favorable majority on\\n', 'five different occasions. During the same period, however, there were\\n', 'nine unfavorable reports and only once did the subject reach the point\\n', 'of a general debate. At no time could anything like the required\\n', 'two-thirds vote be obtained.\\n', '\\n', '=The Changing Status of Women.=--While the suffrage movement was\\n', 'lagging, the activities of women in other directions were steadily\\n', 'multiplying. College after college--Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Smith, Wellesley,\\n', 'to mention a few--was founded to give them the advantages of higher\\n', 'education. Other institutions, especially the state universities of the\\n', 'West, opened their doors to women, and women were received into the\\n', 'professions of law and medicine. By the rapid growth of public high\\n', 'schools in which girls enjoyed the same rights as boys, education was\\n', 'extended still more widely. The number of women teachers increased by\\n', 'leaps and bounds.\\n', '\\n', 'Meanwhile women were entering nearly every branch of industry and\\n', 'business. How many of them worked at gainful occupations before 1870 we\\n', 'do not know; but from that year forward we have the records of the\\n', 'census. Between 1870 and 1900 the proportion of women in the professions\\n', 'rose from less than two per cent to more than ten per cent; in trade and\\n', 'transportation from 24.8 per cent to 43.2 per cent; and in manufacturing\\n', 'from 13 to 19 per cent. In 1910, there were over 8,000,000 women\\n', 'gainfully employed as compared with 30,000,000 men. When, during the war\\n', 'on Germany, the government established the principle of equal pay for\\n', 'equal work and gave official recognition to the value of their services\\n', 'in industry, it was discovered how far women had traveled along the road\\n', 'forecast by the leaders of 1848.\\n', '\\n', \"=The Club Movement among Women.=--All over the country women's societies\\n\", 'and clubs were started to advance this or that reform or merely to study\\n', \"literature, art, and science. In time these women's organizations of all\\n\", 'kinds were federated into city, state, and national associations and\\n', 'drawn into the consideration of public questions. Under the leadership\\n', 'of Frances Willard they made temperance reform a vital issue. They took\\n', 'an interest in legislation pertaining to prisons, pure food, public\\n', 'health, and municipal government, among other things. At their sessions\\n', 'and conferences local, state, and national issues were discussed until\\n', 'finally, it seems, everything led to the quest of the franchise. By\\n', \"solemn resolution in 1914 the National Federation of Women's Clubs,\\n\", 'representing nearly two million club women, formally endorsed woman\\n', 'suffrage. In the same year the National Education Association, speaking\\n', 'for the public school teachers of the land, added its seal of approval.\\n', '\\n', '=State and National Action.=--Again the suffrage movement was in full\\n', 'swing in the states. Washington in 1910, California in 1911, Oregon,\\n', 'Kansas, and Arizona in 1912, Nevada and Montana in 1914 by popular vote\\n', 'enfranchised their women. Illinois in 1913 conferred upon them the right\\n', 'to vote for President of the United States. The time had arrived for a\\n', 'new movement. A number of younger suffragists sought to use the votes of\\n', 'women in the equal suffrage states to compel one or both of the national\\n', 'political parties to endorse and carry through Congress the federal\\n', 'suffrage amendment. Pressure then came upon Congress from every\\n', 'direction: from the suffragists who made a straight appeal on the\\n', 'grounds of justice; and from the suffragists who besought the women of\\n', 'the West to vote against candidates for President, who would not approve\\n', 'the federal amendment. In 1916, for the first time, a leading\\n', 'presidential candidate, Mr. Charles E. Hughes, speaking for the\\n', 'Republicans, endorsed the federal amendment and a distinguished\\n', 'ex-President, Roosevelt, exerted a powerful influence to keep it an\\n', 'issue in the campaign.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'CONFERENCE OF MEN AND WOMEN DELEGATES AT A NATIONAL CONVENTION IN\\n', '1920]\\n', '\\n', '=National Enfranchisement.=--After that, events moved rapidly. The great\\n', 'state of New York adopted equal suffrage in 1917. Oklahoma, South\\n', 'Dakota, and Michigan swung into line the following year; several other\\n', 'states, by legislative action, gave women the right to vote for\\n', 'President. In the meantime the suffrage battle at Washington grew\\n', 'intense. Appeals and petitions poured in upon Congress and the\\n', 'President. Militant suffragists held daily demonstrations in Washington.\\n', 'On September 30, 1918, President Wilson, who, two years before, had\\n', 'opposed federal action and endorsed suffrage by state adoption only,\\n', 'went before Congress and urged the passage of the suffrage amendment to\\n', 'the Constitution. In June, 1919, the requisite two-thirds vote was\\n', 'secured; the resolution was carried and transmitted to the states for\\n', 'ratification. On August 28, 1920, the thirty-sixth state, Tennessee,\\n', 'approved the amendment, making three-fourths of the states as required\\n', 'by the Constitution. Thus woman suffrage became the law of the land. A\\n', 'new political democracy had been created.

The nation had\\n', 'definitely passed into industrialism. The number of city dwellers\\n', 'employed for wages as contrasted with the farmers working on their own\\n', 'land was steadily mounting. The free land, once the refuge of restless\\n', 'workingmen of the East and the immigrants from Europe, was a thing of\\n', 'the past. As President Roosevelt later said in speaking of the great\\n', 'coal strike, \"a few generations ago, the American workman could have\\n', 'saved money, gone West, and taken up a homestead. Now the free lands\\n', 'were gone. In earlier days, a man who began with a pick and shovel might\\n', 'come to own a mine. That outlet was now closed as regards the immense\\n', 'majority.... The majority of men who earned wages in the coal industry,\\n', 'if they wished to progress at all, were compelled to progress not by\\n', 'ceasing to be wage-earners but by improving the conditions under which\\n', 'all the wage-earners of the country lived and worked.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The disappearance of the free land, President Roosevelt went on to say,\\n', 'also produced \"a crass inequality in the bargaining relation of the\\n', 'employer and the individual employee standing alone. The great\\n', 'coal-mining and coal-carrying companies which employed their tens of\\n', 'thousands could easily dispense with the services of any particular\\n', 'miner. The miner, on the other hand, however expert, could not dispense\\n', 'with the companies. He needed a job; his wife and children would starve\\n', 'if he did not get one.... Individually the miners were impotent when\\n', 'they sought to enter a wage contract with the great companies; they\\n', 'could make fair terms only by uniting into trade unions to bargain\\n', 'collectively.\" It was of this state of affairs that President Taft spoke\\n', 'when he favored the modification of the common law \"so as to put\\n', 'employees of little power and means on a level with their employers in\\n', 'adjusting and agreeing upon their mutual obligations.\"\\n', '\\n', 'John D. Rockefeller, Jr., on the side of the great captains of industry,\\n', 'recognized the same facts. He said: \"In the early days of the\\n', 'development of industry, the employer and capital investor were\\n', 'frequently one. Daily contact was had between him and his employees, who\\n', 'were his friends and neighbors.... Because of the proportions which\\n', 'modern industry has attained, employers and employees are too often\\n', 'strangers to each other.... Personal relations can be revived only\\n', 'through adequate representation of the employees. Representation is a\\n', 'principle which is fundamentally just and vital to the successful\\n', 'conduct of industry.... It is not consistent for us as Americans to\\n', 'demand democracy in government and practice autocracy in industry....\\n', 'With the developments what they are in industry to-day, there is sure to\\n', 'come a progressive evolution from aristocratic single control, whether\\n', 'by capital, labor, or the state, to democratic, cooperative control by\\n', 'all three.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'COOPERATION BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES\\n', '\\n', '=Company Unions.=--The changed economic life described by the three\\n', 'eminent men just quoted was acknowledged by several great companies and\\n', 'business concerns. All over the country decided efforts were made to\\n', 'bridge the gulf which industry and the corporation had created. Among\\n', 'the devices adopted was that of the \"company union.\" In one of the\\n', 'Western lumber mills, for example, all the employees were invited to\\n', 'join a company organization; they held monthly meetings to discuss\\n', 'matters of common concern; they elected a \"shop committee\" to confer\\n', 'with the representatives of the company; and periodically the agents of\\n', 'the employers attended the conferences of the men to talk over matters\\n', 'of mutual interest. The function of the shop committee was to consider\\n', 'wages, hours, safety rules, sanitation, recreation and other problems.\\n', 'Whenever any employee had a grievance he took it up with the foreman\\n', 'and, if it was not settled to his satisfaction, he brought it before the\\n', 'shop committee. If the members of the shop committee decided in favor of\\n', 'the man with a grievance, they attempted to settle the matter with the\\n', \"company's agents. All these things failing, the dispute was transferred\\n\", \"to a grand meeting of all the employees with the employers'\\n\", 'representatives, in common council. A deadlock, if it ensued from such a\\n', 'conference, was broken by calling in impartial arbitrators selected by\\n', 'both sides from among citizens outside the mill. Thus the employees were\\n', 'given a voice in all decisions affecting their work and welfare; rights\\n', 'and grievances were treated as matters of mutual interest rather than\\n', 'individual concern. Representatives of trade unions from outside,\\n', 'however, were rigidly excluded from all negotiations between employers\\n', 'and the employees.\\n', '\\n', '=Profit-sharing.=--Another proposal for drawing capital and labor\\n', 'together was to supplement the wage system by other ties. Sometimes lump\\n', \"sums were paid to employees who remained in a company's service for a\\n\", 'definite period of years. Again they were given a certain percentage of\\n', 'the annual profits. In other instances, employees were allowed to buy\\n', 'stock on easy terms and thus become part owners in the concern. This\\n', 'last plan was carried so far by a large soap manufacturing company that\\n', 'the employees, besides becoming stockholders, secured the right to elect\\n', 'representatives to serve on the board of directors who managed the\\n', 'entire business. So extensive had profit-sharing become by 1914 that the\\n', 'Federal Industrial Relations Committee, appointed by the President,\\n', 'deemed it worthy of a special study. Though opposed by regular trade\\n', 'unions, it was undoubtedly growing in popularity.\\n', '\\n', '=Labor Managers and Welfare Work.=--Another effort of employers to meet\\n', 'the problems of the new age appeared in the appointment of specialists,\\n', 'known as employment managers, whose task it was to study the relations\\n', 'existing between masters and workers and discover practical methods for\\n', 'dealing with each grievance as it arose. By 1918, hundreds of big\\n', 'companies had recognized this modern \"profession\" and universities were\\n', 'giving courses of instruction on the subject to young men and women. In\\n', 'that year a national conference of employment managers was held at\\n', 'Rochester, New York. The discussion revealed a wide range of duties\\n', 'assigned to managers, including questions of wages, hours, sanitation,\\n', 'rest rooms, recreational facilities, and welfare work of every kind\\n', 'designed to make the conditions in mills and factories safer and more\\n', 'humane. Thus it was evident that hundreds of employers had abandoned the\\n', 'old idea that they were dealing merely with individual employees and\\n', 'that their obligations ended with the payment of any wages they saw fit\\n', 'to fix. In short, they were seeking to develop a spirit of cooperation\\n', 'to take the place of competition and enmity; and to increase the\\n', 'production of commodities by promoting the efficiency and happiness of\\n', 'the producers.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE RISE AND GROWTH OF ORGANIZED LABOR\\n', '\\n', '=The American Federation of Labor.=--Meanwhile a powerful association of\\n', 'workers representing all the leading trades and crafts, organized into\\n', 'unions of their own, had been built up outside the control of employers.\\n', 'This was the American Federation of Labor, a nation-wide union of\\n', 'unions, founded in 1886 on the basis of beginnings made five years\\n', 'before. At the time of its establishment it had approximately 150,000\\n', 'members. Its growth up to the end of the century was slow, for the total\\n', 'enrollment in 1900 was only 300,000. At that point the increase became\\n', 'marked. The membership reached 1,650,000 in 1904 and more than 3,000,000\\n', 'in 1919. To be counted in the ranks of organized labor were several\\n', 'strong unions, friendly to the Federation, though not affiliated with\\n', 'it. Such, for example, were the Railway Brotherhoods with more than half\\n', 'a million members. By the opening of 1920 the total strength of\\n', 'organized labor was put at about 4,000,000 members, meaning, if we\\n', 'include their families, that nearly one-fifth of the people of the\\n', 'United States were in some positive way dependent upon the operations of\\n', 'trade unions.\\n', '\\n', '=Historical Background.=--This was the culmination of a long and\\n', 'significant history. Before the end of the eighteenth century, the\\n', 'skilled workmen--printers, shoemakers, tailors, and carpenters--had, as\\n', 'we have seen, formed local unions in the large cities. Between 1830 and\\n', '1860, several aggressive steps were taken in the American labor\\n', 'movement. For one thing, the number of local unions increased by leaps\\n', 'and bounds in all the industrial towns. For another, there was\\n', 'established in every large manufacturing city a central labor body\\n', 'composed of delegates from the unions of the separate trades. In the\\n', 'local union the printers or the cordwainers, for example, considered\\n', 'only their special trade problems. In the central labor union, printers,\\n', 'cordwainers, iron molders, and other craftsmen considered common\\n', 'problems and learned to cooperate with one another in enforcing the\\n', 'demands of each craft. A third step was the federation of the unions of\\n', 'the same craftsmen in different cities. The printers of New York,\\n', 'Philadelphia, Boston, and other towns, for instance, drew together and\\n', 'formed a national trade union of printers built upon the local unions of\\n', 'that craft. By the eve of the Civil War there were four or five powerful\\n', 'national unions of this character. The expansion of the railway made\\n', 'travel and correspondence easier and national conventions possible even\\n', 'for workmen of small means. About 1834 an attempt was made to federate\\n', 'the unions of all the different crafts into a national organization; but\\n', 'the effort was premature.\\n', '\\n', '_The National Labor Union._--The plan which failed in 1834 was tried\\n', 'again in the sixties. During the war, industries and railways had\\n', 'flourished as never before; prices had risen rapidly; the demand for\\n', 'labor had increased; wages had mounted slowly, but steadily. Hundreds of\\n', 'new local unions had been founded and eight or ten national trade unions\\n', 'had sprung into being. The time was ripe, it seemed, for a national\\n', \"consolidation of all labor's forces; and in 1866, the year after the\\n\", 'surrender of General Lee at Appomattox, the \"National Labor Union\" was\\n', 'formed at Baltimore under the leadership of an experienced organizer,\\n', 'W.H. Sylvis of the iron molders. The purpose of the National Labor Union\\n', \"was not merely to secure labor's standard demands touching hours, wages,\\n\", 'and conditions of work or to maintain the gains already won. It leaned\\n', 'toward political action and radical opinions. Above all, it sought to\\n', 'eliminate the conflict between capital and labor by making workingmen\\n', 'the owners of shops through the formation of cooperative industries. For\\n', 'six years the National Labor Union continued to hold conferences and\\n', 'carry on its propaganda; but most of the cooperative enterprises failed,\\n', 'political dissensions arose, and by 1872 the experiment had come to an\\n', 'end.\\n', '\\n', '_The Knights of Labor._--While the National Labor Union was\\n', 'experimenting, there grew up in the industrial world a more radical\\n', 'organization known as the \"Noble Order of the Knights of Labor.\" It was\\n', 'founded in Philadelphia in 1869, first as a secret society with rituals,\\n', 'signs, and pass words; \"so that no spy of the boss can find his way into\\n', 'the lodge room to betray his fellows,\" as the Knights put it. In form\\n', 'the new organization was simple. It sought to bring all laborers,\\n', 'skilled and unskilled, men and women, white and colored, into a mighty\\n', 'body of local and national unions without distinction of trade or craft.\\n', 'By 1885, ten years after the national organization was established, it\\n', 'boasted a membership of over 700,000. In philosophy, the Knights of\\n', 'Labor were socialistic, for they advocated public ownership of the\\n', 'railways and other utilities and the formation of cooperative societies\\n', 'to own and manage stores and factories.\\n', '\\n', 'As the Knights were radical in spirit and their strikes, numerous and\\n', 'prolonged, were often accompanied by violence, the organization alarmed\\n', 'employers and the general public, raising up against itself a vigorous\\n', 'opposition. Weaknesses within, as well as foes from without, started the\\n', 'Knights on the path to dissolution. They waged more strikes than they\\n', 'could carry on successfully; their cooperative experiments failed as\\n', 'those of other labor groups before them had failed; and the rank and\\n', 'file could not be kept in line. The majority of the members wanted\\n', 'immediate gains in wages or the reduction of hours; when their hopes\\n', 'were not realized they drifted away from the order. The troubles were\\n', 'increased by the appearance of the American Federation of Labor, a still\\n', 'mightier organization composed mainly of skilled workers who held\\n', 'strategic positions in industry. When they failed to secure the\\n', 'effective support of the Federation in their efforts to organize the\\n', 'unskilled, the employers closed in upon them; then the Knights declined\\n', 'rapidly in power. By 1890 they were a negligible factor and in a short\\n', 'time they passed into the limbo of dead experiments.\\n', '\\n', '=The Policies of the American Federation.=--Unlike the Knights of Labor,\\n', 'the American Federation of Labor sought, first of all, to be very\\n', 'practical in its objects and methods. It avoided all kinds of\\n', 'socialistic theories and attended strictly to the business of organizing\\n', 'unions for the purpose of increasing wages, shortening hours, and\\n', 'improving working conditions for its members. It did not try to include\\n', 'everybody in one big union but brought together the employees of each\\n', 'particular craft whose interests were clearly the same. To prepare for\\n', 'strikes and periods of unemployment, it raised large funds by imposing\\n', 'heavy dues and created a benefit system to hold men loyally to the\\n', 'union. In order to permit action on a national scale, it gave the\\n', 'superior officers extensive powers over local unions.\\n', '\\n', 'While declaring that employers and employees had much in common, the\\n', 'Federation strongly opposed company unions. Employers, it argued, were\\n', \"affiliated with the National Manufacturers' Association or with similar\\n\", \"employers' organizations; every important industry was now national in\\n\", 'scope; and wages and hours, in view of competition with other shops,\\n', 'could not be determined in a single factory, no matter how amicable\\n', 'might be the relations of the company and its workers in that particular\\n', 'plant. For these reasons, the Federation declared company unions and\\n', 'local shop committees inherently weak; it insisted that hours, wages,\\n', 'and other labor standards should be fixed by general trade agreements\\n', 'applicable to all the plants of a given industry, even if subject to\\n', 'local modifications.\\n', '\\n', 'At the same time, the Federation, far from deliberately antagonizing\\n', 'employers, sought to enlist their cooperation and support. It affiliated\\n', 'with the National Civic Federation, an association of business men,\\n', 'financiers, and professional men, founded in 1900 to promote friendly\\n', 'relations in the industrial world. In brief, the American Federation of\\n', 'Labor accepted the modern industrial system and, by organization within\\n', 'it, endeavored to secure certain definite terms and conditions for trade\\n', 'unionists.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE WIDER RELATIONS OF ORGANIZED LABOR\\n', '\\n', '=The Socialists.=--The trade unionism \"pure and simple,\" espoused by the\\n', 'American Federation of Labor, seemed to involve at first glance nothing\\n', 'but businesslike negotiations with employers. In practice it did not\\n', 'work out that way. The Federation was only six years old when a new\\n', 'organization, appealing directly for the labor vote--namely, the\\n', 'Socialist Labor Party--nominated a candidate for President, launched\\n', 'into a national campaign, and called upon trade unionists to desert the\\n', 'older parties and enter its fold.\\n', '\\n', 'The socialistic idea, introduced into national politics in 1892, had\\n', 'been long in germination. Before the Civil War, a number of reformers,\\n', 'including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Horace Greeley, and Wendell Phillips,\\n', 'deeply moved by the poverty of the great industrial cities, had\\n', 'earnestly sought relief in the establishment of cooperative or\\n', 'communistic colonies. They believed that people should go into the\\n', 'country, secure land and tools, own them in common so that no one could\\n', 'profit from exclusive ownership, and produce by common labor the food\\n', 'and clothing necessary for their support. For a time this movement\\n', 'attracted wide interest, but it had little vitality. Nearly all the\\n', 'colonies failed. Selfishness and indolence usually disrupted the best of\\n', 'them.\\n', '\\n', 'In the course of time this \"Utopian\" idea was abandoned, and another set\\n', 'of socialist doctrines, claiming to be more \"scientific,\" appeared\\n', 'instead. The new school of socialists, adopting the principles of a\\n', 'German writer and agitator, Karl Marx, appealed directly to workingmen.\\n', 'It urged them to unite against the capitalists, to get possession of the\\n', 'machinery of government, and to introduce collective or public ownership\\n', 'of railways, land, mines, mills, and other means of production. The\\n', 'Marxian socialists, therefore, became political. They sought to organize\\n', 'labor and to win elections. Like the other parties they put forward\\n', 'candidates and platforms. The Socialist Labor party in 1892, for\\n', 'example, declared in favor of government ownership of utilities, free\\n', 'school books, woman suffrage, heavy income taxes, and the referendum.\\n', 'The Socialist party, founded in 1900, with Eugene V. Debs, the leader of\\n', 'the Pullman strike, as its candidate, called for public ownership of all\\n', 'trusts, monopolies, mines, railways; and the chief means of production.\\n', 'In the course of time the vote of the latter organization rose to\\n', 'considerable proportions, reaching almost a million in 1912. It declined\\n', 'four years later and then rose in 1920 to about the same figure.\\n', '\\n', 'In their appeal for votes, the socialists of every type turned first to\\n', 'labor. At the annual conventions of the American Federation of Labor\\n', 'they besought the delegates to endorse socialism. The president of the\\n', 'Federation, Samuel Gompers, on each occasion took the floor against\\n', 'them. He repudiated socialism and the socialists, on both theoretical\\n', 'and practical grounds. He opposed too much public ownership, declaring\\n', 'that the government was as likely as any private employer to oppress\\n', 'labor. The approval of socialism, he maintained, would split the\\n', 'Federation on the rock of politics, weaken it in its fight for higher\\n', 'wages and shorter hours, and prejudice the public against it. At every\\n', 'turn he was able to vanquish the socialists in the Federation, although\\n', 'he could not prevent it from endorsing public ownership of the railways\\n', 'at the convention of 1920.\\n', '\\n', '=The Extreme Radicals.=--Some of the socialists, defeated in their\\n', 'efforts to capture organized labor and seeing that the gains in\\n', 'elections were very meager, broke away from both trade unionism and\\n', 'politics. One faction, the Industrial Workers of the World, founded in\\n', '1905, declared themselves opposed to all capitalists, the wages system,\\n', 'and craft unions. They asserted that the \"working class and the\\n', 'employing class have nothing in common\" and that trade unions only\\n', 'pitted one set of workers against another set. They repudiated all\\n', 'government ownership and the government itself, boldly proclaiming their\\n', 'intention to unite all employees into one big union and seize the\\n', 'railways, mines, and mills of the country. This doctrine, so\\n', 'revolutionary in tone, called down upon the extremists the condemnation\\n', 'of the American Federation of Labor as well as of the general public. At\\n', 'its convention in 1919, the Federation went on record as \"opposed to\\n', 'Bolshevism, I.W.W.-ism, and the irresponsible leadership that encourages\\n', 'such a policy.\" It announced its \"firm adherence to American ideals.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Federation and Political Issues.=--The hostility of the Federation\\n', 'to the socialists did not mean, however, that it was indifferent to\\n', 'political issues or political parties. On the contrary, from time to\\n', 'time, at its annual conventions, it endorsed political and social\\n', 'reforms, such as the initiative, referendum, and recall, the abolition\\n', 'of child labor, the exclusion of Oriental labor, old-age pensions, and\\n', 'government ownership. Moreover it adopted the policy of \"rewarding\\n', 'friends and punishing enemies\" by advising members to vote for or\\n', 'against candidates according to their stand on the demands of organized\\n', 'labor.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'SAMUEL GOMPERS AND OTHER LABOR LEADERS]\\n', '\\n', 'This policy was pursued with especial zeal in connection with disputes\\n', 'over the use of injunctions in labor controversies. An injunction is a\\n', 'bill or writ issued by a judge ordering some person or corporation to do\\n', 'or to refrain from doing something. For example, a judge may order a\\n', 'trade union to refrain from interfering with non-union men or to\\n', 'continue at work handling goods made by non-union labor; and he may fine\\n', 'or imprison those who disobey his injunction, the penalty being\\n', 'inflicted for \"contempt of court.\" This ancient legal device came into\\n', 'prominence in connection with nation-wide railway strikes in 1877. It\\n', 'was applied with increasing frequency after its effective use against\\n', 'Eugene V. Debs in the Pullman strike of 1894.\\n', '\\n', 'Aroused by the extensive use of the writ, organized labor demanded that\\n', 'the power of judges to issue injunctions in labor disputes be limited by\\n', 'law. Representatives of the unions sought support from the Democrats and\\n', 'the Republicans; they received from the former very specific and cordial\\n', 'endorsement. In 1896 the Democratic platform denounced \"government by\\n', 'injunction as a new and highly dangerous form of oppression.\" Mr.\\n', 'Gompers, while refusing to commit the Federation to Democratic politics,\\n', 'privately supported Mr. Bryan. In 1908, he came out openly and boasted\\n', 'that eighty per cent of the votes of the Federation had been cast for\\n', 'the Democratic candidate. Again in 1912 the same policy was pursued. The\\n', 'reward was the enactment in 1914 of a federal law exempting trade unions\\n', 'from prosecution as combinations in restraint of trade, limiting the use\\n', 'of the injunction in labor disputes, and prescribing trial by jury in\\n', 'case of contempt of court. This measure was hailed by Mr. Gompers as the\\n', '\"Magna Carta of Labor\" and a vindication of his policy. As a matter of\\n', 'fact, however, it did not prevent the continued use of injunctions\\n', 'against trade unions. Nevertheless Mr. Gompers was unshaken in his\\n', 'conviction that organized labor should not attempt to form an\\n', 'independent political party or endorse socialist or other radical\\n', 'economic theories.\\n', '\\n', '=Organized Labor and the Public.=--Besides its relations to employers,\\n', 'radicals within its own ranks, and political questions, the Federation\\n', 'had to face responsibilities to the general public. With the passing of\\n', 'time these became heavy and grave. While industries were small and\\n', 'conflicts were local in character, a strike seldom affected anybody but\\n', 'the employer and the employees immediately involved in it. When,\\n', 'however, industries and trade unions became organized on a national\\n', 'scale and a strike could paralyze a basic enterprise like coal mining or\\n', 'railways, the vital interests of all citizens were put in jeopardy.\\n', 'Moreover, as increases in wages and reductions in hours often added\\n', 'directly to the cost of living, the action of the unions affected the\\n', 'well-being of all--the food, clothing, and shelter of the whole people.\\n', '\\n', 'For the purpose of meeting the issue raised by this state of affairs, it\\n', 'was suggested that employers and employees should lay their disputes\\n', 'before commissions of arbitration for decision and settlement. President\\n', 'Cleveland, in a message of April 2, 1886, proposed such a method for\\n', 'disposing of industrial controversies, and two years later Congress\\n', 'enacted a voluntary arbitration law applicable to the railways. The\\n', 'principle was extended in 1898 and again in 1913, and under the\\n', 'authority of the federal government many contentions in the railway\\n', 'world were settled by arbitration.\\n', '\\n', 'The success of such legislation induced some students of industrial\\n', 'questions to urge that unions and employers should be compelled to\\n', 'submit all disputes to official tribunals of arbitration. Kansas\\n', 'actually passed such a law in 1920. Congress in the Esch-Cummins railway\\n', 'bill of the same year created a federal board of nine members to which\\n', 'all railway controversies, not settled by negotiation, must be\\n', 'submitted. Strikes, however, were not absolutely forbidden. Generally\\n', 'speaking, both employers and employees opposed compulsory adjustments\\n', 'without offering any substitute in case voluntary arbitration should not\\n', 'be accepted by both parties to a dispute.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'IMMIGRATION AND AMERICANIZATION\\n', '\\n', '=The Problems of Immigration.=--From its very inception, the American\\n', 'Federation of Labor, like the Knights of Labor before it, was confronted\\n', 'by numerous questions raised by the ever swelling tide of aliens coming\\n', 'to our shores. In its effort to make each trade union all-inclusive, it\\n', 'had to wrestle with a score or more languages. When it succeeded in\\n', 'thoroughly organizing a craft, it often found its purposes defeated by\\n', 'an influx of foreigners ready to work for lower wages and thus undermine\\n', 'the foundations of the union.\\n', '\\n', 'At the same time, persons outside the labor movement began to be\\n', 'apprehensive as they contemplated the undoubted evil, as well as the\\n', 'good, that seemed to be associated with the \"alien invasion.\" They saw\\n', 'whole sections of great cities occupied by people speaking foreign\\n', 'tongues, reading only foreign newspapers, and looking to the Old World\\n', 'alone for their ideas and their customs. They witnessed an expanding\\n', 'army of total illiterates, men and women who could read and write no\\n', 'language at all; while among those aliens who could read few there were\\n', 'who knew anything of American history, traditions, and ideals. Official\\n', 'reports revealed that over twenty per cent of the men of the draft army\\n', 'during the World War could not read a newspaper or write a letter home.\\n', 'Perhaps most alarming of all was the discovery that thousands of alien\\n', 'men are in the United States only on a temporary sojourn, solely to make\\n', 'money and return home with their savings. These men, willing to work for\\n', 'low wages and live in places unfit for human beings, have no stake in\\n', 'this country and do not care what becomes of it.\\n', '\\n', '=The Restriction of Immigration.=--In all this there was, strictly\\n', 'speaking, no cause for surprise. Since the foundation of our republic\\n', 'the policy of the government had been to encourage the coming of the\\n', 'alien. For nearly one hundred years no restraining act was passed by\\n', 'Congress, while two important laws positively encouraged it; namely, the\\n', 'homestead act of 1862 and the contract immigration law of 1864. Not\\n', 'until American workingmen came into open collision with cheap Chinese\\n', 'labor on the Pacific Coast did the federal government spread the first\\n', 'measure of limitation on the statute books. After the discovery of gold,\\n', 'and particularly after the opening of the railway construction era, a\\n', 'horde of laborers from China descended upon California. Accustomed to\\n', 'starvation wages and indifferent to the conditions of living, they\\n', 'threatened to cut the American standard to the point of subsistence. By\\n', '1876 the protest of American labor was loud and long and both the\\n', 'Republicans and the Democrats gave heed to it. In 1882 Congress enacted\\n', 'a law prohibiting the admission of Chinese laborers to the United States\\n', 'for a term of ten years--later extended by legislation. In a little\\n', 'while the demand arose for the exclusion of the Japanese as well. In\\n', 'this case no exclusion law was passed; but an understanding was reached\\n', 'by which Japan agreed not to issue passports to her laborers authorizing\\n', 'them to come to the United States. By act of Congress in 1907 the\\n', 'President was empowered to exclude any laborers who, having passports to\\n', 'Canada, Hawaii, or Mexico, attempted to enter our country.\\n', '\\n', 'These laws and agreements, however, did not remove all grounds for the\\n', 'agitation of the subject. They were difficult to enforce and it was\\n', 'claimed by residents of the Coast that in spite of federal authority\\n', 'Oriental laborers were finding their way into American ports. Moreover,\\n', 'several Western states, anxious to preserve the soil for American\\n', 'ownership, enacted laws making it impossible for Chinese and Japanese to\\n', 'buy land outright; and in other ways they discriminated against\\n', 'Orientals. Such proceedings placed the federal government in an\\n', 'embarrassing position. By treaty it had guaranteed specific rights to\\n', 'Japanese citizens in the United States, and the government at Tokyo\\n', 'contended that the state laws just cited violated the terms of the\\n', 'international agreement. The Western states were fixed in their\\n', 'determination to control Oriental residents; Japan was equally\\n', 'persistent in asking that no badge of inferiority be attached to her\\n', 'citizens. Subjected to pressure on both sides, the federal government\\n', 'sought a way out of the deadlock.\\n', '\\n', 'Having embarked upon the policy of restriction in 1882, Congress readily\\n', 'extended it. In that same year it barred paupers, criminals, convicts,\\n', 'and the insane. Three years later, mainly owing to the pressure of the\\n', 'Knights of Labor, it forbade any person, company, or association to\\n', 'import aliens under contract. By an act of 1887, the contract labor\\n', 'restriction was made even more severe. In 1903, anarchists were excluded\\n', 'and the bureau of immigration was transferred from the Treasury\\n', 'Department to the Department of Commerce and Labor, in order to provide\\n', 'for a more rigid execution of the law. In 1907 the classes of persons\\n', 'denied admission were widened to embrace those suffering from physical\\n', 'and mental defects and otherwise unfit for effective citizenship. When\\n', 'the Department of Labor was established in 1913 the enforcement of the\\n', 'law was placed in the hands of the Secretary of Labor, W.B. Wilson, who\\n', 'was a former leader in the American Federation of Labor.\\n', '\\n', '=The Literacy Test.=--Still the advocates of restriction were not\\n', 'satisfied. Still organized labor protested and demanded more protection\\n', 'against the competition of immigrants. In 1917 it won a thirty-year\\n', 'battle in the passage of a bill excluding \"all aliens over sixteen years\\n', 'of age, physically capable of reading, who cannot read the English\\n', 'language or some other language or dialect, including Hebrew or\\n', 'Yiddish.\" Even President Wilson could not block it, for a two-thirds\\n', 'vote to overcome his veto was mustered in Congress.\\n', '\\n', 'This act, while it served to exclude illiterates, made no drastic cut in\\n', 'the volume of immigration. Indeed a material reduction was resolutely\\n', 'opposed in many quarters. People of certain nationalities already in the\\n', 'United States objected to every barrier that shut out their own kinsmen.\\n', 'Some Americans of the old stock still held to the idea that the United\\n', 'States should continue to be an asylum for \"the oppressed of the earth.\"\\n', 'Many employers looked upon an increased labor supply as the means of\\n', 'escaping what they called \"the domination of trade unions.\" In the babel\\n', 'of countless voices, the discussion of these vital matters went on in\\n', 'town and country.\\n', '\\n', '=Americanization.=--Intimately connected with the subject of immigration\\n', 'was a call for the \"Americanization\" of the alien already within our\\n', 'gates. The revelation of the illiteracy in the army raised the cry and\\n', 'the demand was intensified when it was found that many of the leaders\\n', 'among the extreme radicals were foreign in birth and citizenship.\\n', 'Innumerable programs for assimilating the alien to American life were\\n', 'drawn up, and in 1919 a national conference on the subject was held in\\n', 'Washington under the auspices of the Department of the Interior. All\\n', 'were agreed that the foreigner should be taught to speak and write the\\n', 'language and understand the government of our country. Congress was\\n', 'urged to lend aid in this vast undertaking. America, as ex-President\\n', 'Roosevelt had said, was to find out \"whether it was a nation or a\\n', 'boarding-house.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=General References=\\n', '\\n', 'J.R.

In this spirit, as President,\\n', 'he gave the signal for work by summoning Congress in a special session\\n', 'on April 7, 1913. He invited the cooperation of all \"forward-looking\\n', 'men\" and indicated that he would assume the role of leadership. As an\\n', 'evidence of his resolve, he appeared before Congress in person to read\\n', 'his first message, reviving the old custom of Washington and Adams. Then\\n', 'he let it be known that he would not give his party any rest until it\\n', 'fulfilled its pledges to the country. When Democratic Senators balked at\\n', 'tariff reductions, they were sharply informed that the party had\\n', 'plighted its word and that no excuses or delays would be tolerated.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'DOMESTIC LEGISLATION\\n', '\\n', '=Financial Measures.=--Under this spirited leadership Congress went to\\n', 'work, passing first the Underwood tariff act of 1913, which made a\\n', 'downward revision in the rates of duty, fixing them on the average about\\n', 'twenty-six per cent lower than the figures of 1907. The protective\\n', 'principle was retained, but an effort was made to permit a moderate\\n', 'element of foreign competition. As a part of the revenue act Congress\\n', 'levied a tax on incomes as authorized by the sixteenth amendment to the\\n', 'Constitution. The tax which roused such party passions twenty years\\n', 'before was now accepted as a matter of course.\\n', '\\n', 'Having disposed of the tariff, Congress took up the old and vexatious\\n', 'currency question and offered a new solution in the form of the federal\\n', 'reserve law of December, 1913. This measure, one of the most interesting\\n', 'in the history of federal finance, embraced four leading features. In\\n', 'the first place, it continued the prohibition on the issuance of notes\\n', 'by state banks and provided for a national currency. In the second\\n', 'place, it put the new banking system under the control of a federal\\n', 'reserve board composed entirely of government officials. To prevent the\\n', 'growth of a \"central money power,\" it provided, in the third place, for\\n', 'the creation of twelve federal reserve banks, one in each of twelve\\n', 'great districts into which the country is divided. All local national\\n', 'banks were required and certain other banks permitted to become members\\n', 'of the new system and share in its control. Finally, with a view to\\n', 'expanding the currency, a step which the Democrats had long urged upon\\n', 'the country, the issuance of paper money, under definite safeguards, was\\n', 'authorized.\\n', '\\n', 'Mindful of the agricultural interest, ever dear to the heart of\\n', \"Jefferson's followers, the Democrats supplemented the reserve law by the\\n\", 'Farm Loan Act of 1916, creating federal agencies to lend money on farm\\n', 'mortgages at moderate rates of interest. Within a year $20,000,000 had\\n', 'been lent to farmers, the heaviest borrowing being in nine Western and\\n', 'Southern states, with Texas in the lead.\\n', '\\n', '=Anti-trust Legislation.=--The tariff and currency laws were followed by\\n', 'three significant measures relative to trusts. Rejecting utterly the\\n', 'Progressive doctrine of government regulation, President Wilson\\n', 'announced that it was the purpose of the Democrats \"to destroy monopoly\\n', 'and maintain competition as the only effective instrument of business\\n', 'liberty.\" The first step in this direction, the Clayton Anti-trust Act,\\n', 'carried into great detail the Sherman law of 1890 forbidding and\\n', 'penalizing combinations in restraint of interstate and foreign trade. In\\n', 'every line it revealed a determined effort to tear apart the great\\n', 'trusts and to put all business on a competitive basis. Its terms were\\n', 'reinforced in the same year by a law creating a Federal Trade Commission\\n', 'empowered to inquire into the methods of corporations and lodge\\n', 'complaints against concerns \"using any unfair method of competition.\" In\\n', 'only one respect was the severity of the Democratic policy relaxed. An\\n', 'act of 1918 provided that the Sherman law should not apply to companies\\n', 'engaged in export trade, the purpose being to encourage large\\n', 'corporations to enter foreign commerce.\\n', '\\n', 'The effect of this whole body of anti-trust legislation, in spite of\\n', 'much labor on it, remained problematical. Very few combinations were\\n', 'dissolved as a result of it. Startling investigations were made into\\n', 'alleged abuses on the part of trusts; but it could hardly be said that\\n', 'huge business concerns had lost any of their predominance in American\\n', 'industry.\\n', '\\n', '=Labor Legislation.=--By no mere coincidence, the Clayton Anti-trust law\\n', 'of 1914 made many concessions to organized labor. It declared that \"the\\n', 'labor of a human being is not a commodity or an article of commerce,\"\\n', 'and it exempted unions from prosecution as \"combinations in restraint of\\n', 'trade.\" It likewise defined and limited the uses which the federal\\n', 'courts might make of injunctions in labor disputes and guaranteed trial\\n', 'by jury to those guilty of disobedience (see p. 581).\\n', '\\n', \"The Clayton law was followed the next year by the Seamen's Act giving\\n\", 'greater liberty of contract to American sailors and requiring an\\n', 'improvement of living conditions on shipboard. This was such a drastic\\n', 'law that shipowners declared themselves unable to meet foreign\\n', 'competition under its terms, owing to the low labor standards of other\\n', 'countries.\\n', '\\n', \"Still more extraordinary than the Seamen's Act was the Adamson law of\\n\", '1916 fixing a standard eight-hour work-day for trainmen on railroads--a\\n', 'measure wrung from Congress under a threat of a great strike by the four\\n', 'Railway Brotherhoods. This act, viewed by union leaders as a triumph,\\n', 'called forth a bitter denunciation of \"trade union domination,\" but it\\n', 'was easier to criticize than to find another solution of the problem.\\n', '\\n', \"Three other laws enacted during President Wilson's administration were\\n\", 'popular in the labor world. One of them provided compensation for\\n', 'federal employees injured in the discharge of their duties. Another\\n', 'prohibited the labor of children under a certain age in the industries\\n', 'of the nation. A third prescribed for coal miners in Alaska an\\n', 'eight-hour day and modern safeguards for life and health. There were\\n', 'positive proofs that organized labor had obtained a large share of power\\n', 'in the councils of the country.\\n', '\\n', '=Federal and State Relations.=--If the interference of the government\\n', 'with business and labor represented a departure from the old idea of\\n', '\"the less government the better,\" what can be said of a large body of\\n', 'laws affecting the rights of states? The prohibition of child labor\\n', 'everywhere was one indication of the new tendency. Mr. Wilson had once\\n', 'declared such legislation unconstitutional; the Supreme Court declared\\n', 'it unconstitutional; but Congress, undaunted, carried it into effect\\n', 'under the guise of a tax on goods made by children below the age limit.\\n', 'There were other indications of the drift. Large sums of money were\\n', 'appropriated by Congress in 1916 to assist the states in building and\\n', 'maintaining highways. The same year the Farm Loan Act projected the\\n', 'federal government into the sphere of local money lending. In 1917\\n', 'millions of dollars were granted to states in aid of vocational\\n', 'education, incidentally imposing uniform standards throughout the\\n', 'country. Evidently the government was no longer limited to the duties of\\n', 'the policeman.\\n', '\\n', '=The Prohibition Amendment.=--A still more significant form of\\n', 'intervention in state affairs was the passage, in December, 1917, of an\\n', 'amendment to the federal Constitution establishing national prohibition\\n', 'of the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors as beverages. This\\n', 'was the climax of a historical movement extending over half a century.\\n', 'In 1872, a National Prohibition party, launched three years before,\\n', 'nominated its first presidential candidate and inaugurated a campaign of\\n', 'agitation. Though its vote was never large, the cause for which it\\n', 'stood found increasing favor among the people. State after state by\\n', 'popular referendum abolished the liquor traffic within its borders. By\\n', '1917 at least thirty-two of the forty-eight were \"dry.\" When the federal\\n', 'amendment was submitted for approval, the ratification was surprisingly\\n', 'swift. In a little more than a year, namely, on January 16, 1919, it was\\n', 'proclaimed. Twelve months later the amendment went into effect.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'COLONIAL AND FOREIGN POLICIES\\n', '\\n', '=The Philippines and Porto Rico.=--Independence for the Philippines and\\n', 'larger self-government for Porto Rico had been among the policies of the\\n', 'Democratic party since the campaign of 1900. President Wilson in his\\n', 'annual messages urged upon Congress more autonomy for the Filipinos and\\n', 'a definite promise of final independence. The result was the Jones\\n', 'Organic Act for the Philippines passed in 1916. This measure provided\\n', 'that the upper as well as the lower house of the Philippine legislature\\n', 'should be elected by popular vote, and declared it to be the intention\\n', 'of the United States to grant independence \"as soon as a stable\\n', 'government can be established.\" This, said President Wilson on signing\\n', 'the bill, is \"a very satisfactory advance in our policy of extending to\\n', 'them self-government and control of their own affairs.\" The following\\n', \"year Congress, yielding to President Wilson's insistence, passed a new\\n\", '\\n', 'organic act for Porto Rico, making both houses of the legislature\\n', 'elective and conferring American citizenship upon the inhabitants of the\\n', 'island.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: THE CARIBBEAN REGION]\\n', '\\n', '=American Power in the Caribbean.=--While extending more self-government\\n', 'to its dominions, the United States enlarged its sphere of influence in\\n', 'the Caribbean. The supervision of finances in Santo Domingo, inaugurated\\n', \"in Roosevelt's administration, was transformed into a protectorate under\\n\", 'Wilson. In 1914 dissensions in the republic led to the landing of\\n', 'American marines to \"supervise\" the elections. Two years later, an\\n', 'officer in the American navy, with authority from Washington, placed\\n', 'the entire republic \"in a state of military occupation.\" He proceeded to\\n', 'suspend the government and laws of the country, exile the president,\\n', 'suppress the congress, and substitute American military authority. In\\n', '1919 a consulting board of four prominent Dominicans was appointed to\\n', 'aid the American military governor; but it resigned the next year after\\n', 'making a plea for the restoration of independence to the republic. For\\n', 'all practical purposes, it seemed, the sovereignty of Santo Domingo had\\n', 'been transferred to the United States.\\n', '\\n', 'In the neighboring republic of Haiti, a similar state of affairs\\n', 'existed. In the summer of 1915 a revolution broke out there--one of a\\n', 'long series beginning in 1804--and our marines were landed to restore\\n', 'order. Elections were held under the supervision of American officers,\\n', 'and a treaty was drawn up placing the management of Haitian finances and\\n', 'the local constabulary under American authority. In taking this action,\\n', 'our Secretary of State was careful to announce: \"The United States\\n', 'government has no purpose of aggression and is entirely disinterested in\\n', 'promoting this protectorate.\" Still it must be said that there were\\n', 'vigorous protests on the part of natives and American citizens against\\n', 'the conduct of our agents in the island. In 1921 President Wilson was\\n', 'considering withdrawal.\\n', '\\n', 'In line with American policy in the West Indian waters was the purchase\\n', 'in 1917 of the Danish Islands just off the coast of Porto Rico. The\\n', 'strategic position of the islands, especially in relation to Haiti and\\n', 'Porto Rico, made them an object of American concern as early as 1867,\\n', 'when a treaty of purchase was negotiated only to be rejected by the\\n', 'Senate of the United States. In 1902 a second arrangement was made, but\\n', 'this time it was defeated by the upper house of the Danish parliament.\\n', 'The third treaty brought an end to fifty years of bargaining and the\\n', 'Stars and Stripes were raised over St. Croix, St. Thomas, St. John, and\\n', 'numerous minor islands scattered about in the neighborhood. \"It would be\\n', 'suicidal,\" commented a New York newspaper, \"for America, on the\\n', 'threshold of a great commercial expansion in South America, to suffer a\\n', 'Heligoland, or a Gibraltar, or an Aden to be erected by her rivals at\\n', 'the mouth of her Suez.\" On the mainland American power was strengthened\\n', 'by the establishment of a protectorate over Nicaragua in 1916.\\n', '\\n', '=Mexican Relations.=--The extension of American enterprise southward\\n', 'into Latin America, of which the operations in the Caribbean regions\\n', 'were merely one phase, naturally carried Americans into Mexico to\\n', 'develop the natural resources of that country. Under the iron rule of\\n', 'General Porfirio Diaz, established in 1876 and maintained with only a\\n', 'short break until 1911, Mexico had become increasingly attractive to our\\n', 'business men. On the invitation of President Diaz, they had invested\\n', 'huge sums in Mexican lands, oil fields, and mines, and had laid the\\n', 'foundations of a new industrial order. The severe regime instituted by\\n', 'Diaz, however, stirred popular discontent. The peons, or serfs, demanded\\n', 'the break-up of the great estates, some of which had come down from the\\n', 'days of Cortez. Their clamor for \"the restoration of the land to the\\n', 'people could not be silenced.\" In 1911 Diaz was forced to resign and\\n', 'left the country.\\n', '\\n', 'Mexico now slid down the path to disorder. Revolutions and civil\\n', 'commotions followed in swift succession. A liberal president, Madero,\\n', 'installed as the successor to Diaz, was deposed in 1913 and brutally\\n', 'murdered. Huerta, a military adventurer, hailed for a time as another\\n', '\"strong man,\" succeeded Madero whose murder he was accused of\\n', 'instigating. Although Great Britain and nearly all the powers of Europe\\n', 'accepted the new government as lawful, the United States steadily\\n', 'withheld recognition. In the meantime Mexico was torn by insurrections\\n', 'under the leadership of Carranza, a friend of Madero, Villa, a bandit of\\n', 'generous pretensions, and Zapata, a radical leader of the peons. Without\\n', 'the support of the United States, Huerta was doomed.\\n', '\\n', 'In the summer of 1914, the dictator resigned and fled from the capital,\\n', 'leaving the field to Carranza. For six years the new president,\\n', 'recognized by the United States, held a precarious position which he\\n', 'vigorously strove to strengthen against various revolutionary movements.\\n', 'At length in 1920, he too was deposed and murdered, and another military\\n', 'chieftain, Obregon, installed in power.\\n', '\\n', 'These events right at our door could not fail to involve the government\\n', 'of the United States. In the disorders many American citizens lost their\\n', 'lives. American property was destroyed and land owned by Americans was\\n', 'confiscated. A new Mexican constitution, in effect nationalizing the\\n', 'natural resources of the country, struck at the rights of foreign\\n', 'investors. Moreover the Mexican border was in constant turmoil. Even in\\n', 'the last days of his administration, Mr. Taft felt compelled to issue a\\n', 'solemn warning to the Mexican government protesting against the\\n', 'violation of American rights.\\n', '\\n', 'President Wilson, soon after his inauguration, sent a commissioner to\\n', 'Mexico to inquire into the situation. Although he declared a general\\n', 'policy of \"watchful waiting,\" he twice came to blows with Mexican\\n', 'forces. In 1914 some American sailors at Tampico were arrested by a\\n', 'Mexican officer; the Mexican government, although it immediately\\n', 'released the men, refused to make the required apology for the incident.\\n', 'As a result President Wilson ordered the landing of American forces at\\n', 'Vera Cruz and the occupation of the city. A clash of arms followed in\\n', 'which several Americans were killed. War seemed inevitable, but at this\\n', 'juncture the governments of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile tendered their\\n', 'good offices as mediators. After a few weeks of negotiation, during\\n', 'which Huerta was forced out of power, American forces were withdrawn\\n', 'from Vera Cruz and the incident closed.\\n', '\\n', 'In 1916 a second break in amicable relations occurred. In the spring of\\n', \"that year a band of Villa's men raided the town of Columbus, New Mexico,\\n\", 'killing several citizens and committing robberies. A punitive expedition\\n', 'under the command of General Pershing was quickly sent out to capture\\n', 'the offenders. Against the protests of President Carranza, American\\n', 'forces penetrated deeply into Mexico without effecting the object of\\n', 'the undertaking. This operation lasted until January, 1917, when the\\n', 'imminence of war with Germany led to the withdrawal of the American\\n', 'soldiers. Friendly relations were resumed with the Mexican government\\n', 'and the policy of \"watchful waiting\" was continued.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN WAR\\n', '\\n', '=The Outbreak of the War.=--In the opening days of August, 1914, the\\n', 'age-long jealousies of European nations, sharpened by new imperial\\n', 'ambitions, broke out in another general conflict such as had shaken the\\n', 'world in the days of Napoleon. On June 28, the heir to the\\n', 'Austro-Hungarian throne was assassinated at Serajevo, the capital of\\n', 'Bosnia, an Austrian province occupied mainly by Serbs. With a view to\\n', 'stopping Serbian agitation for independence, Austria-Hungary laid the\\n', 'blame for this incident on the government of Serbia and made humiliating\\n', 'demands on that country. Germany at once proposed that the issue should\\n', 'be regarded as \"an affair which should be settled solely between\\n', 'Austria-Hungary and Serbia\"; meaning that the small nation should be\\n', 'left to the tender mercies of a great power. Russia refused to take this\\n', 'view. Great Britain proposed a settlement by mediation. Germany backed\\n', 'up Austria to the limit. To use the language of the German authorities:\\n', '\"We were perfectly aware that a possible warlike attitude of\\n', 'Austria-Hungary against Serbia might bring Russia upon the field and\\n', 'that it might therefore involve us in a war, in accordance with our\\n', 'duties as allies. We could not, however, in these vital interests of\\n', 'Austria-Hungary which were at stake, advise our ally to take a yielding\\n', 'attitude not compatible with his dignity nor deny him our assistance.\"\\n', 'That made the war inevitable.\\n', '\\n', 'Every day of the fateful August, 1914, was crowded with momentous\\n', 'events. On the 1st, Germany declared war on Russia. On the 2d, the\\n', 'Germans invaded the little duchy of Luxemburg and notified the King of\\n', 'Belgium that they were preparing to violate the neutrality of his realm\\n', 'on their way to Paris. On the same day, Great Britain, anxiously\\n', 'besought by the French government, promised the aid of the British navy\\n', 'if German warships made hostile demonstrations in the Channel. August\\n', '3d, the German government declared war on France. The following day,\\n', 'Great Britain demanded of Germany respect for Belgian neutrality and,\\n', 'failing to receive the guarantee, broke off diplomatic relations. On the\\n', '5th, the British prime minister announced that war had opened between\\n', 'England and Germany. The storm now broke in all its pitiless fury.\\n', '\\n', '=The State of American Opinion.=--Although President Wilson promptly\\n', 'proclaimed the neutrality of the United States, the sympathies of a\\n', 'large majority of the American people were without doubt on the side of\\n', 'Great Britain and France. To them the invasion of the little kingdom of\\n', 'Belgium and the horrors that accompanied German occupation were odious\\n', 'in the extreme. Moreover, they regarded the German imperial government\\n', 'as an autocratic power wielded in the interest of an ambitious military\\n', 'party. The Kaiser, William II, and the Crown Prince were the symbols of\\n', 'royal arrogance. On the other hand, many Americans of German descent, in\\n', 'memory of their ties with the Fatherland, openly sympathized with the\\n', 'Central Powers; and many Americans of Irish descent, recalling their\\n', 'long and bitter struggle for home rule in Ireland, would have regarded\\n', 'British defeat as a merited redress of ancient grievances.\\n', '\\n', 'Extremely sensitive to American opinion, but ill informed about it, the\\n', 'German government soon began systematic efforts to present its cause to\\n', 'the people of the United States in the most favorable light possible.\\n', 'Dr. Bernhard Dernburg, the former colonial secretary of the German\\n', 'empire, was sent to America as a special agent. For months he filled the\\n', 'newspapers, magazines, and periodicals with interviews, articles, and\\n', 'notes on the justice of the Teutonic cause. From a press bureau in New\\n', 'York flowed a stream of pamphlets, leaflets, and cartoons. A magazine,\\n', '\"The Fatherland,\" was founded to secure \"fair play for Germany and\\n', 'Austria.\" Several professors in American universities, who had received\\n', 'their training in Germany, took up the pen in defense of the Central\\n', 'Empires. The German language press, without exception it seems, the\\n', 'National German Alliance, minor German societies, and Lutheran churches\\n', 'came to the support of the German cause. Even the English language\\n', 'papers, though generally favorable to the Entente Allies, opened their\\n', 'columns in the interest of equal justice to the spokesmen for all the\\n', 'contending powers of Europe.\\n', '\\n', 'Before two weeks had elapsed the controversy had become so intense that\\n', 'President Wilson (August 18, 1914) was moved to caution his countrymen\\n', 'against falling into angry disputes. \"Every man,\" he said, \"who really\\n', 'loves America will act and speak in the true spirit of neutrality which\\n', 'is the spirit of impartiality and fairness and friendliness to all\\n', 'concerned.... We must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must\\n', 'put a curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that\\n', 'might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before\\n', 'another.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Clash over American Trade.=--As in the time of the Napoleonic wars,\\n', 'the conflict in Europe raised fundamental questions respecting rights of\\n', 'Americans trading with countries at peace as well as those at war. On\\n', 'this point there existed on August 1, 1914, a fairly definite body of\\n', 'principles by which nations were bound. Among them the following were of\\n', 'vital significance. In the first place, it was recognized that an enemy\\n', 'merchant ship caught on the high seas was a legitimate prize of war\\n', 'which might be seized and confiscated. In the second place, it was\\n', 'agreed that \"contraband of war\" found on an enemy or neutral ship was a\\n', 'lawful prize; any ship suspected of carrying it was liable to search and\\n', 'if caught with forbidden goods was subject to seizure. In the third\\n', 'place, international law prescribed that a peaceful merchant ship,\\n', 'whether belonging to an enemy or to a neutral country, should not be\\n', 'destroyed or sunk without provision for the safety of crew and\\n', 'passengers. In the fourth place, it was understood that a belligerent\\n', 'had the right, if it could, to blockade the ports of an enemy and\\n', 'prevent the ingress and egress of all ships; but such a blockade, to be\\n', 'lawful, had to be effective.\\n', '\\n', 'These general principles left undetermined two important matters: \"What\\n', 'is an effective blockade?\" and \"What is contraband of war?\" The task of\\n', 'answering these questions fell to Great Britain as mistress of the seas.\\n', 'Although the German submarines made it impossible for her battleships to\\n', 'maintain a continuous patrol of the waters in front of blockaded ports,\\n', '\\n', 'she declared the blockade to be none the less \"effective\" because her\\n', 'navy was supreme. As to contraband of war Great Britain put such a broad\\n', 'interpretation upon the term as to include nearly every important\\n', 'article of commerce. Early in 1915 she declared even cargoes of grain\\n', 'and flour to be contraband, defending the action on the ground that the\\n', 'German government had recently taken possession of all domestic stocks\\n', 'of corn, wheat, and flour.\\n', '\\n', 'A new question arose in connection with American trade with the neutral\\n', 'countries surrounding Germany. Great Britain early began to intercept\\n', 'ships carrying oil, gasoline, and copper--all war materials of prime\\n', 'importance--on the ground that they either were destined ultimately to\\n', 'Germany or would release goods for sale to Germans. On November 2, 1914,\\n', 'the English government announced that the Germans wore sowing mines in\\n', 'open waters and that therefore the whole of the North Sea was a military\\n', 'zone. Ships bound for Denmark, Norway, and Sweden were ordered to come\\n', 'by the English Channel for inspection and sailing directions. In effect,\\n', 'Americans were now licensed by Great Britain to trade in certain\\n', 'commodities and in certain amounts with neutral countries.\\n', '\\n', 'Against these extraordinary measures, the State Department at Washington\\n', 'lodged pointed objections, saying: \"This government is reluctantly\\n', \"forced to the conclusion that the present policy of His Majesty's\\n\", 'government toward neutral ships and cargoes exceeds the manifest\\n', 'necessity of a belligerent and constitutes restrictions upon the rights\\n', 'of American citizens on the high seas, which are not justified by the\\n', 'rules of international law or required under the principle of\\n', 'self-preservation.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Germany Begins the Submarine Campaign.=--Germany now announced that, on\\n', 'and after February 18, 1915, the whole of the English Channel and the\\n', 'waters around Great Britain would be deemed a war zone and that every\\n', 'enemy ship found therein would be destroyed. The German decree added\\n', 'that, as the British admiralty had ordered the use of neutral flags by\\n', 'English ships in time of distress, neutral vessels would be in danger of\\n', 'destruction if found in the forbidden area. It was clear that Germany\\n', 'intended to employ submarines to destroy shipping. A new factor was thus\\n', 'introduced into naval warfare, one not provided for in the accepted laws\\n', 'of war. A warship overhauling a merchant vessel could easily take its\\n', 'crew and passengers on board for safe keeping as prescribed by\\n', 'international law; but a submarine ordinarily could do nothing of the\\n', 'sort. Of necessity the lives and the ships of neutrals, as well as of\\n', 'belligerents, were put in mortal peril. This amazing conduct Germany\\n', 'justified on the ground that it was mere retaliation against Great\\n', 'Britain for her violations of international law.\\n', '\\n', 'The response of the United States to the ominous German order was swift\\n', 'and direct. On February 10, 1915, it warned Germany that if her\\n', 'commanders destroyed American lives and ships in obedience to that\\n', 'decree, the action would \"be very hard indeed to reconcile with the\\n', 'friendly relations happily subsisting between the two governments.\" The\\n', 'American note added that the German imperial government would be held to\\n', '\"strict accountability\" and all necessary steps would be taken to\\n', 'safeguard American lives and American rights. This was firm and clear\\n', 'language, but the only response which it evoked from Germany was a\\n', 'suggestion that, if Great Britain would allow food supplies to pass\\n', 'through the blockade, the submarine campaign would be dropped.\\n', '\\n', '=Violations of American Rights.=--Meanwhile Germany continued to ravage\\n', 'shipping on the high seas. On January 28, a German raider sank the\\n', 'American ship, _William P. Frye_, in the South Atlantic; on March 28, a\\n', 'British ship, the _Falaba_, was sunk by a submarine and many on board,\\n', 'including an American citizen, were killed; and on April 28, a German\\n', 'airplane dropped bombs on the American steamer _Cushing_. On the morning\\n', 'of May 1, 1915, Americans were astounded to see in the newspapers an\\n', 'advertisement, signed by the German Imperial Embassy, warning travelers\\n', 'of the dangers in the war zone and notifying them that any who ventured\\n', 'on British ships into that area did so at their own risk. On that day,\\n', 'the _Lusitania_, a British steamer, sailed from New York for Liverpool.\\n', 'On May 7, without warning, the ship was struck by two torpedoes and in a\\n', 'few minutes went down by the bow, carrying to death 1153 persons\\n', 'including 114 American men, women, and children. A cry of horror ran\\n', 'through the country. The German papers in America and a few American\\n', 'people argued that American citizens had been duly warned of the danger\\n', 'and had deliberately taken their lives into their own hands; but the\\n', 'terrible deed was almost universally condemned by public opinion.\\n', '\\n', '=The _Lusitania_ Notes.=--On May 14, the Department of State at\\n', 'Washington made public the first of three famous notes on the\\n', '_Lusitania_ case. It solemnly informed the German government that \"no\\n', 'warning that an unlawful and inhumane act will be committed can possibly\\n', 'be accepted as an excuse or palliation for that act or as an abatement\\n', 'of the responsibility for its commission.\" It called upon the German\\n', 'government to disavow the act, make reparation as far as possible, and\\n', 'take steps to prevent \"the recurrence of anything so obviously\\n', 'subversive of the principles of warfare.\" The note closed with a clear\\n', 'caution to Germany that the government of the United States would not\\n', '\"omit any word or any act necessary to the performance of its sacred\\n', 'duty of maintaining the rights of the United States and its citizens and\\n', 'of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.\" The die was cast;\\n', 'but Germany in reply merely temporized.\\n', '\\n', 'In a second note, made public on June 11, the position of the United\\n', 'States was again affirmed. William Jennings Bryan, the Secretary of\\n', \"State, had resigned because the drift of President Wilson's policy was\\n\", 'not toward mediation but the strict maintenance of American rights, if\\n', 'need be, by force of arms. The German reply was still evasive and German\\n', 'naval commanders continued their course of sinking merchant ships. In a\\n', 'third and final note of July 21, 1915, President Wilson made it clear to\\n', 'Germany that he meant what he said when he wrote that he would maintain\\n', 'the rights of American citizens. Finally after much discussion and\\n', 'shifting about, the German ambassador on September 1, 1915, sent a brief\\n', 'note to the Secretary of State: \"Liners will not be sunk by our\\n', 'submarines without warning and without safety of the lives of\\n', 'non-combatants, provided the liners do not try to escape or offer\\n', 'resistance.\" Editorially, the New York _Times_ declared: \"It is a\\n', 'triumph not only of diplomacy but of reason, of humanity, of justice,\\n', 'and of truth.\" The Secretary of State saw in it \"a recognition of the\\n', 'fundamental principles for which we have contended.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Presidential Election of 1916.=--In the midst of this crisis came\\n', 'the presidential campaign. On the Republican side everything seemed to\\n', 'depend upon the action of the Progressives. If the breach created in\\n', '1912 could be closed, victory was possible; if not, defeat was certain.\\n', 'A promise of unity lay in the fact that the conventions of the\\n', 'Republicans and Progressives were held simultaneously in Chicago. The\\n', 'friends of Roosevelt hoped that both parties would select him as their\\n', 'candidate; but this hope was not realized. The Republicans chose, and\\n', 'the Progressives accepted, Charles E. Hughes, an associate justice of\\n', 'the federal Supreme Court who, as governor of New York, had won a\\n', 'national reputation by waging war on \"machine politicians.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In the face of the clamor for expressions of sympathy with one or the\\n', 'other of the contending powers of Europe, the Republicans chose a middle\\n', 'course, declaring that they would uphold all American rights \"at home\\n', 'and abroad, by land and by sea.\" This sentiment Mr. Hughes echoed in his\\n', 'acceptance speech. By some it was interpreted to mean a firmer policy in\\n', 'dealing with Great Britain; by others, a more vigorous handling of the\\n', 'submarine menace. The Democrats, on their side, renominated President\\n', 'Wilson by acclamation, reviewed with pride the legislative achievements\\n', 'of the party, and commended \"the splendid diplomatic victories of our\\n', 'great President who has preserved the vital interests of our government\\n', 'and its citizens and kept us out of war.\"\\n', '\\n', \"In the election which ensued President Wilson's popular vote exceeded\\n\", 'that cast for Mr. Hughes by more than half a million, while his\\n', 'electoral vote stood 277 to 254. The result was regarded, and not\\n', 'without warrant, as a great personal triumph for the President. He had\\n', 'received the largest vote yet cast for a presidential candidate. The\\n', 'Progressive party practically disappeared, and the Socialists suffered a\\n', 'severe set-back, falling far behind the vote of 1912.\\n', '\\n', '=President Wilson Urges Peace upon the Warring Nations.=--Apparently\\n', 'convinced that his pacific policies had been profoundly approved by his\\n', 'countrymen, President Wilson, soon after the election, addressed \"peace\\n', 'notes\" to the European belligerents. On December 16, the German Emperor\\n', 'proposed to the Allied Powers that they enter into peace negotiations, a\\n', 'suggestion that was treated as a mere political maneuver by the opposing\\n', 'governments. Two days later President Wilson sent a note to the warring\\n', 'nations asking them to avow \"the terms upon which war might be\\n', 'concluded.\" To these notes the Central Powers replied that they were\\n', 'ready to meet their antagonists in a peace conference; and Allied Powers\\n', 'answered by presenting certain conditions precedent to a satisfactory\\n', 'settlement. On January 22, 1917, President Wilson in an address before\\n', 'the Senate, declared it to be a duty of the United States to take part\\n', 'in the establishment of a stable peace on the basis of certain\\n', 'principles. These were, in short: \"peace without victory\"; the right of\\n', 'nationalities to freedom and self-government; the independence of\\n', 'Poland; freedom of the seas; the reduction of armaments; and the\\n', 'abolition of entangling alliances. The whole world was discussing the\\n', \"President's remarkable message, when it was dumbfounded to hear, on\\n\", 'January 31, that the German ambassador at Washington had announced the\\n', 'official renewal of ruthless submarine warfare.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE UNITED STATES AT WAR\\n', '\\n', '=Steps toward War.=--Three days after the receipt of the news that the\\n', 'German government intended to return to its former submarine policy,\\n', 'President Wilson severed diplomatic relations with the German empire. At\\n', 'the same time he explained to Congress that he desired no conflict with\\n', 'Germany and would await an \"overt act\" before taking further steps to\\n', 'preserve American rights. \"God grant,\" he concluded, \"that we may not be\\n', 'challenged to defend them by acts of willful injustice on the part of\\n', 'the government of Germany.\" Yet the challenge came. Between February 26\\n', 'and April 2, six American merchant vessels were torpedoed, in most cases\\n', 'without any warning and without regard to the loss of American lives.\\n', 'President Wilson therefore called upon Congress to answer the German\\n', 'menace. The reply of Congress on April 6 was a resolution, passed with\\n', 'only a few dissenting votes, declaring the existence of a state of war\\n', 'with Germany. Austria-Hungary at once severed diplomatic relations with\\n', 'the United States; but it was not until December 7 that Congress, acting\\n', 'on the President\\'s advice, declared war also on that \"vassal of the\\n', 'German government.\"\\n', '\\n', '=American War Aims.=--In many addresses at the beginning and during the\\n', 'course of the war, President Wilson stated the purposes which actuated\\n', 'our government in taking up arms. He first made it clear that it was a\\n', 'war of self-defense. \"The military masters of Germany,\" he exclaimed,\\n', '\"denied us the right to be neutral.\" Proof of that lay on every hand.\\n', 'Agents of the German imperial government had destroyed American lives\\n', 'and American property on the high seas. They had filled our communities\\n', 'with spies. They had planted bombs in ships and munition works. They had\\n', 'fomented divisions among American citizens.\\n', '\\n', 'Though assailed in many ways and compelled to resort to war, the United\\n', 'States sought no material rewards. \"The world must be made safe for\\n', 'democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of\\n', 'political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no\\n', 'conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In a very remarkable message read to Congress on January 8, 1918,\\n', 'President Wilson laid down his famous \"fourteen points\" summarizing the\\n', 'ideals for which we were fighting. They included open treaties of peace,\\n', 'openly arrived at; absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas; the\\n', 'removal, as far as possible, of trade barriers among nations; reduction\\n', 'of armaments; adjustment of colonial claims in the interest of the\\n', 'populations concerned; fair and friendly treatment of Russia; the\\n', 'restoration of Belgium; righting the wrong done to France in 1871 in the\\n', 'matter of Alsace-Lorraine; adjustment of Italian frontiers along the\\n', 'lines of nationality; more liberty for the peoples of Austria-Hungary;\\n', 'the restoration of Serbia and Rumania; the readjustment of the Turkish\\n', 'Empire; an independent Poland; and an association of nations to afford\\n', 'mutual guarantees to all states great and small. On a later occasion\\n', 'President Wilson elaborated the last point, namely, the formation of a\\n', 'league of nations to guarantee peace and establish justice among the\\n', 'powers of the world. Democracy, the right of nations to determine their\\n', 'own fate, a covenant of enduring peace--these were the ideals for which\\n', 'the American people were to pour out their blood and treasure.\\n', '\\n', '=The Selective Draft.=--The World War became a war of nations. The\\n', 'powers against which we were arrayed had every able-bodied man in\\n', 'service and all their resources, human and material, thrown into the\\n', 'scale. For this reason, President Wilson summoned the whole people of\\n', 'the United States to make every sacrifice necessary for victory.\\n', 'Congress by law decreed that the national army should be chosen from all\\n', 'male citizens and males not enemy aliens who had declared their\\n', 'intention of becoming citizens. By the first act of May 18, 1917, it\\n', 'fixed the age limits at twenty-one to thirty-one inclusive. Later, in\\n', 'August, 1918, it extended them to eighteen and forty-five. From the men\\n', 'of the first group so enrolled were chosen by lot the soldiers for the\\n', 'World War who, with the regular army and the national guard, formed the\\n', 'American Expeditionary Force upholding the American cause on the\\n', 'battlefields of Europe. \"The whole nation,\" said the President, \"must be\\n', 'a team in which each man shall play the part for which he is best\\n', 'fitted.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Liberty Loans and Taxes.=--In order that the military and naval forces\\n', 'should be stinted in no respect, the nation was called upon to place its\\n', 'financial resources at the service of the government. Some urged the\\n', '\"conscription of wealth as well as men,\" meaning the support of the war\\n', 'out of taxes upon great fortunes; but more conservative counsels\\n', 'prevailed. Four great Liberty Loans were floated, all the agencies of\\n', 'modern publicity being employed to enlist popular interest. The first\\n', 'loan had four and a half million subscribers; the fourth more than\\n', 'twenty million. Combined with loans were heavy taxes. A progressive tax\\n', 'was laid upon incomes beginning with four per cent on incomes in the\\n', 'lower ranges and rising to sixty-three per cent of that part of any\\n', 'income above $2,000,000. A progressive tax was levied upon inheritances.\\n', 'An excess profits tax was laid upon all corporations and partnerships,\\n', 'rising in amount to sixty per cent of the net income in excess of\\n', 'thirty-three per cent on the invested capital. \"This,\" said a\\n', 'distinguished economist, \"is the high-water mark in the history of\\n', 'taxation. Never before in the annals of civilization has an attempt been\\n', 'made to take as much as two-thirds of a man\\'s income by taxation.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Mobilizing Material Resources.=--No stone was left unturned to provide\\n', 'the arms, munitions, supplies, and transportation required in the\\n', 'gigantic undertaking. Between the declaration of war and the armistice,\\n', 'Congress enacted law after law relative to food supplies, raw materials,\\n', 'railways, mines, ships, forests, and industrial enterprises. No power\\n', 'over the lives and property of citizens, deemed necessary to the\\n', 'prosecution of the armed conflict, was withheld from the government. The\\n', \"farmer's wheat, the housewife's sugar, coal at the mines, labor in the\\n\", 'factories, ships at the wharves, trade with friendly countries, the\\n', 'railways, banks, stores, private fortunes--all were mobilized and laid\\n', 'under whatever obligations the government deemed imperative. Never was a\\n', 'nation more completely devoted to a single cause.\\n', '\\n', 'A law of August 10, 1917, gave the President power to fix the prices of\\n', 'wheat and coal and to take almost any steps necessary to prevent\\n', 'monopoly and excessive prices. By a series of measures, enlarging the\\n', 'principles of the shipping act of 1916, ships and shipyards were brought\\n', 'under public control and the government was empowered to embark upon a\\n', 'great ship-building program. In December, 1917, the government assumed\\n', 'for the period of the war the operation of the railways under a\\n', 'presidential proclamation which was elaborated in March, 1918, by act of\\n', 'Congress. In the summer of 1918 the express, telephone, and telegraph\\n', 'business of the entire country passed under government control. By war\\n', 'risk insurance acts allowances were made for the families of enlisted\\n', 'men, compensation for injuries was provided, death benefits were\\n', 'instituted, and a system of national insurance was established in the\\n', 'interest of the men in service. Never before in the history of the\\n', 'country had the government taken such a wise and humane view of its\\n', 'obligations to those who served on the field of battle or on the seas.\\n', '\\n', '=The Espionage and Sedition Acts.=--By the Espionage law of June 15,\\n', '1917, and the amending law, known as the Sedition act, passed in May of\\n', 'the following year, the government was given a drastic power over the\\n', 'expression of opinion. The first measure penalized those who conveyed\\n', 'information to a foreign country to be used to the injury of the United\\n', 'States; those who made false statements designed to interfere with the\\n', 'military or naval forces of the United States; those who attempted to\\n', 'stir up insubordination or disloyalty in the army and navy; and those\\n', 'who willfully obstructed enlistment. The Sedition act was still more\\n', 'severe and sweeping in its terms. It imposed heavy penalties upon any\\n', 'person who used \"abusive language about the government or institutions\\n', 'of the country.\" It authorized the dismissal of any officer of the\\n', 'government who committed \"disloyal acts\" or uttered \"disloyal language,\"\\n', 'and empowered the Postmaster General to close the mails to persons\\n', 'violating the law. This measure, prepared by the Department of Justice,\\n', 'encountered vigorous opposition in the Senate, where twenty-four\\n', 'Republicans and two Democrats voted against it. Senator Johnson of\\n', 'California denounced it as a law \"to suppress the freedom of the press\\n', 'in the United States and to prevent any man, no matter who he is, from\\n', 'expressing legitimate criticism concerning the present government.\" The\\n', 'constitutionality of the acts was attacked; but they were sustained by\\n', 'the Supreme Court and stringently enforced.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'THE LAUNCHING OF A SHIP AT THE GREAT NAVAL YARDS, NEWARK, N.J.]\\n', '\\n', '=Labor and the War.=--In view of the restlessness of European labor\\n', 'during the war and especially the proletarian revolution in Russia in\\n', 'November, 1917, some anxiety was early expressed as to the stand which\\n', 'organized labor might take in the United States. It was, however, soon\\n', 'dispelled. Samuel Gompers, speaking for the American Federation of\\n', 'Labor, declared that \"this is labor\\'s war,\" and pledged the united\\n', 'support of all the unions. There was some dissent. The Socialist party\\n', 'denounced the war as a capitalist quarrel; but all the protests combined\\n', 'were too slight to have much effect. American labor leaders were sent to\\n', 'Europe to strengthen the wavering ranks of trade unionists in war-worn\\n', 'England, France, and Italy. Labor was given representation on the\\n', 'important boards and commissions dealing with industrial questions.\\n', 'Trade union standards were accepted by the government and generally\\n', 'applied in industry. The Department of Labor became one of the powerful\\n', 'war centers of the nation. In a memorable address to the American\\n', 'Federation of Labor, President Wilson assured the trade unionists that\\n', 'labor conditions should not be made unduly onerous by the war and\\n', 'received in return a pledge of loyalty from the Federation. Recognition\\n', \"of labor's contribution to winning the war was embodied in the treaty of\\n\", 'peace, which provided for a permanent international organization to\\n', 'promote the world-wide effort of labor to improve social conditions.\\n', '\"The league of nations has for its object the establishment of universal\\n', 'peace,\" runs the preamble to the labor section of the treaty, \"and such\\n', 'a peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice....\\n', 'The failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labor is an\\n', 'obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the\\n', 'conditions in their own countries.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The American Navy in the War.=--As soon as Congress declared war the\\n', 'fleet was mobilized, American ports were thrown open to the warships of\\n', 'the Allies, immediate provision was made for increasing the number of\\n', 'men and ships, and a contingent of war vessels was sent to cooperate\\n', 'with the British and French in their life-and-death contest with\\n', 'submarines. Special effort was made to stimulate the production of\\n', '\"submarine chasers\" and \"scout cruisers\" to be sent to the danger zone.\\n', 'Convoys were provided to accompany the transports conveying soldiers to\\n', 'France. Before the end of the war more than three hundred American\\n', 'vessels and 75,000 officers and men were operating in European waters.\\n', 'Though the German fleet failed to come out and challenge the sea power\\n', 'of the Allies, the battleships of the United States were always ready to\\n', 'do their full duty in such an event. As things turned out, the service\\n', 'of the American navy was limited mainly to helping in the campaign that\\n', 'wore down the submarine menace to Allied shipping.\\n', '\\n', '=The War in France.=--Owing to the peculiar character of the warfare in\\n', 'France, it required a longer time for American military forces to get\\n', 'into action; but there was no unnecessary delay. Soon after the\\n', 'declaration of war, steps were taken to give military assistance to the\\n', 'Allies. The regular army was enlarged and the troops of the national\\n', 'guard were brought into national service. On June 13, General John J.\\n', 'Pershing, chosen head of the American Expeditionary Forces, reached\\n', 'Paris and began preparations for the arrival of our troops. In June, the\\n', 'vanguard of the army reached France. A slow and steady stream followed.\\n', 'As soon as the men enrolled under the draft were ready, it became a\\n', 'flood. During the period of the war the army was enlarged from about\\n', '190,000 men to 3,665,000, of whom more than 2,000,000 were in France\\n', 'when the armistice was signed.\\n', '\\n', 'Although American troops did not take part on a large scale until the\\n', 'last phase of the war in 1918, several battalions of infantry were in\\n', 'the trenches by October, 1917, and had their first severe encounter with\\n', 'the Germans early in November. In January, 1918, they took over a part\\n', 'of the front line as an American sector. In March, General Pershing\\n', 'placed our forces at the disposal of General Foch, commander-in-chief of\\n', 'the Allied armies. The first division, which entered the Montdidier\\n', 'salient in April, soon was engaged with the enemy, \"taking with splendid\\n', 'dash the town of Cantigny and all other objectives, which were organized\\n', 'and held steadfastly against vicious counter attacks and galling\\n', 'artillery fire.\"\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n', '\\n', 'TROOPS RETURNING FROM FRANCE]\\n', '\\n', 'When the Germans launched their grand drives toward the Marne and Paris,\\n', \"in June and July, 1918, every available man was placed at General Foch's\\n\", 'command. At Belleau Wood, at Chateau-Thierry, and other points along the\\n', 'deep salient made by the Germans into the French lines, American\\n', 'soldiers distinguished themselves by heroic action. They also played an\\n', 'important role in the counter attack that \"smashed\" the salient and\\n', 'drove the Germans back.\\n', '\\n', 'In September, American troops, with French aid, \"wiped out\" the German\\n', 'salient at St. Mihiel. By this time General Pershing was ready for the\\n', 'great American drive to the northeast in the Argonne forest, while he\\n', 'also cooperated with the British in the assault on the Hindenburg line.\\n', 'In the Meuse-Argonne battle, our soldiers encountered some of the most\\n', 'severe fighting of the war and pressed forward steadily against the most\\n', 'stubborn resistance from the enemy. On the 6th of November, reported\\n', 'General Pershing, \"a division of the first corps reached a point on the\\n', 'Meuse opposite Sedan, twenty-five miles from our line of departure. The\\n', 'strategical goal which was our highest hope was gained. We had cut the\\n', \"enemy's main line of communications and nothing but a surrender or an\\n\", 'armistice could save his army from complete disaster.\" Five days later\\n', 'the end came. On the morning of November 11, the order to cease firing\\n', 'went into effect. The German army was in rapid retreat and\\n', 'demoralization had begun. The Kaiser had abdicated and fled into\\n', 'Holland. The Hohenzollern dreams of empire were shattered. In the\\n', 'fifty-second month, the World War, involving nearly every civilized\\n', 'nation on the globe, was brought to a close. More than 75,000 American\\n', 'soldiers and sailors had given their lives. More than 250,000 had been\\n', 'wounded or were missing or in German prison camps.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: WESTERN BATTLE LINES OF THE VARIOUS YEARS OF THE\\n', 'WORLD WAR]\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE SETTLEMENT AT PARIS\\n', '\\n', '=The Peace Conference.=--On January 18, 1919, a conference of the Allied\\n', 'and Associated Powers assembled to pronounce judgment upon the German\\n', 'empire and its defeated satellites: Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and\\n', 'Turkey. It was a moving spectacle. Seventy-two delegates spoke for\\n', 'thirty-two states. The United States, Great Britain, France, Italy, and\\n', 'Japan had five delegates each. Belgium, Brazil, and Serbia were each\\n', 'assigned three. Canada, Australia, South Africa, India, China, Greece,\\n', 'Hedjaz, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Siam, and Czechoslovakia were\\n', 'allotted two apiece. The remaining states of New Zealand, Bolivia, Cuba,\\n', 'Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru,\\n', 'and Uruguay each had one delegate. President Wilson spoke in person for\\n', 'the United States. England, France, and Italy were represented by their\\n', 'premiers: David Lloyd George, Georges Clemenceau, and Vittorio Orlando.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: PREMIERS LLOYD GEORGE, ORLANDO AND CLEMENCEAU AND\\n', 'PRESIDENT WILSON AT PARIS]\\n', '\\n', '=The Supreme Council.=--The real work of the settlement was first\\n', 'committed to a Supreme Council of ten representing the United States,\\n', 'Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan. This was later reduced to five\\n', 'members. Then Japan dropped out and finally Italy, leaving only\\n', 'President Wilson and the Premiers, Lloyd George and Clemenceau, the\\n', '\"Big Three,\" who assumed the burden of mighty decisions. On May 6, their\\n', 'work was completed and in a secret session of the full conference the\\n', 'whole treaty of peace was approved, though a few of the powers made\\n', 'reservations or objections. The next day the treaty was presented to the\\n', 'Germans who, after prolonged protests, signed on the last day of grace,\\n', 'June 28. This German treaty was followed by agreements with Austria,\\n', 'Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey. Collectively these great documents formed\\n', 'the legal basis of the general European settlement.\\n', '\\n', '=The Terms of the Settlement.=--The combined treaties make a huge\\n', 'volume. The German treaty alone embraces about 80,000 words.\\n', 'Collectively they cover an immense range of subjects which may be\\n', 'summarized under five heads: (1) The territorial settlement in Europe;\\n', '(2) the destruction of German military power; (3) reparations for\\n', 'damages done by Germany and her allies; (4) the disposition of German\\n', 'colonies and protectorates; and (5) the League of Nations.\\n', '\\n', 'Germany was reduced by the cession of Alsace-Lorraine to France and the\\n', 'loss of several other provinces. Austria-Hungary was dissolved and\\n', 'dismembered. Russia was reduced by the creation of new states on the\\n', 'west. Bulgaria was stripped of her gains in the recent Balkan wars.\\n', 'Turkey was dismembered. Nine new independent states were created:\\n', 'Poland, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia,\\n', 'Armenia, and Hedjaz. Italy, Greece, Rumania, and Serbia were enlarged by\\n', 'cessions of territory and Serbia was transformed into the great state of\\n', 'Jugoslavia.\\n', '\\n', 'The destruction of German military power was thorough. The entire navy,\\n', 'with minor exceptions, was turned over to the Allied and Associated\\n', \"Powers; Germany's total equipment for the future was limited to six\\n\", 'battleships and six light cruisers, with certain small vessels but no\\n', 'submarines. The number of enlisted men and officers for the army was\\n', 'fixed at not more than 100,000; the General Staff was dissolved; and the\\n', 'manufacture of munitions restricted.\\n', '\\n', 'Germany was compelled to accept full responsibility for all damages; to\\n', 'pay five billion dollars in cash and goods, and to make certain other\\n', 'payments which might be ordered from time to time by an inter-allied\\n', 'reparations commission. She was also required to deliver to Belgium,\\n', 'France, and Italy, millions of tons of coal every year for ten years;\\n', 'while by way of additional compensation to France the rich coal basin of\\n', 'the Saar was placed under inter-allied control to be exploited under\\n', 'French administration for a period of at least fifteen years. Austria\\n', 'and the other associates of Germany were also laid under heavy\\n', 'obligations to the victors. Damages done to shipping by submarines and\\n', 'other vessels were to be paid for on the basis of ton for ton.\\n', '\\n', 'The disposition of the German colonies and the old Ottoman empire\\n', 'presented knotty problems. It was finally agreed that the German\\n', 'colonies and Turkish provinces which were in a backward stage of\\n', 'development should be placed under the tutelage of certain powers acting\\n', 'as \"mandatories\" holding them in \"a sacred trust of civilization.\" An\\n', 'exception to the mandatory principle arose in the case of German rights\\n', 'in Shantung, all of which were transferred directly to Japan. It was\\n', 'this arrangement that led the Chinese delegation to withhold their\\n', 'signatures from the treaty.\\n', '\\n', '=The League of Nations.=--High among the purposes which he had in mind\\n', 'in summoning the nation to arms, President Wilson placed the desire to\\n', 'put an end to war. All through the United States the people spoke of the\\n', '\"war to end war.\" No slogan called forth a deeper response from the\\n', 'public. The President himself repeatedly declared that a general\\n', 'association of nations must be formed to guard the peace and protect all\\n', 'against the ambitions of the few. \"As I see it,\" he said in his address\\n', 'on opening the Fourth Liberty Loan campaign, \"the constitution of the\\n', 'League of Nations and the clear definition of its objects must be a\\n', 'part, in a sense the most essential part, of the peace settlement\\n', 'itself.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Nothing was more natural, therefore, than Wilson's insistence at Paris\\n\", 'upon the formation of an international association. Indeed he had gone\\n', 'to Europe in person largely to accomplish that end. Part One of the\\n', 'treaty with Germany, the Covenant of the League of Nations, was due to\\n', 'his labors more than to any other influence. Within the League thus\\n', 'created were to be embraced all the Allied and Associated Powers and\\n', 'nearly all the neutrals. By a two-thirds vote of the League Assembly the\\n', 'excluded nations might be admitted.\\n', '\\n', 'The agencies of the League of Nations were to be three in number: (1) a\\n', 'permanent secretariat located at Geneva; (2) an Assembly consisting of\\n', 'one delegate from each country, dominion, or self-governing colony\\n', '(including Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and India); (3)\\n', 'and a Council consisting of representatives of the United States, Great\\n', 'Britain, France, Italy, and Japan, and four other representatives\\n', 'selected by the Assembly from time to time.\\n', '\\n', 'The duties imposed on the League and the obligations accepted by its\\n', 'members were numerous and important. The Council was to take steps to\\n', 'formulate a scheme for the reduction of armaments and to submit a plan\\n', 'for the establishment of a permanent Court of International Justice. The\\n', 'members of the League (Article X) were to respect and preserve as\\n', 'against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing\\n', 'political independence of all the associated nations. They were to\\n', 'submit to arbitration or inquiry by the Council all disputes which could\\n', 'not be adjusted by diplomacy and in no case to resort to war until three\\n', 'months after the award. Should any member disregard its covenants, its\\n', 'action would be considered an act of war against the League, which would\\n', 'accordingly cut off the trade and business of the hostile member and\\n', 'recommend through the Council to the several associated governments the\\n', 'military measures to be taken. In case the decision in any arbitration\\n', 'of a dispute was unanimous, the members of the League affected by it\\n', 'were to abide by it.\\n', '\\n', 'Such was the settlement at Paris and such was the association of nations\\n', 'formed to promote the peace of the world. They were quickly approved by\\n', 'most of the powers, and the first Assembly of the League of Nations met\\n', 'at Geneva late in 1920.\\n', '\\n', '=The Treaty in the United States.=--When the treaty was presented to the\\n', 'United States Senate for approval, a violent opposition appeared. In\\n', 'that chamber the Republicans had a slight majority and a two-thirds vote\\n', 'was necessary for ratification. The sentiment for and against the treaty\\n', 'ran mainly along party lines; but the Republicans were themselves\\n', 'divided. The major portion, known as \"reservationists,\" favored\\n', 'ratification with certain conditions respecting American rights; while a\\n', 'small though active minority rejected the League of Nations in its\\n', 'entirety, announcing themselves to be \"irreconcilables.\" The grounds of\\n', 'this Republican opposition lay partly in the terms of peace imposed on\\n', 'Germany and partly in the Covenant of the League of Nations. Exception\\n', 'was taken to the clauses which affected the rights of American citizens\\n', 'in property involved in the adjustment with Germany, but the burden of\\n', 'criticism was directed against the League. Article X guaranteeing\\n', 'against external aggression the political independence and territorial\\n', 'integrity of the members of the League was subjected to a specially\\n', 'heavy fire; while the treatment accorded to China and the sections\\n', 'affecting American internal affairs were likewise attacked as \"unjust\\n', 'and dangerous.\" As an outcome of their deliberations, the Republicans\\n', 'proposed a long list of reservations which touched upon many of the\\n', 'vital parts of the treaty. These were rejected by President Wilson as\\n', 'amounting in effect to a \"nullification of the treaty.\" As a deadlock\\n', 'ensued the treaty was definitely rejected, owing to the failure of its\\n', 'sponsors to secure the requisite two-thirds vote.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: EUROPE]\\n', '\\n', '=The League of Nations in the Campaign of 1920.=--At this juncture the\\n', 'presidential campaign of 1920 opened. The Republicans, while condemning\\n', 'the terms of the proposed League, endorsed the general idea of an\\n', 'international agreement to prevent war. Their candidate, Senator\\n', 'Warren G. Harding of Ohio, maintained a similar position without saying\\n', 'definitely whether the League devised at Paris could be recast in such a\\n', 'manner as to meet his requirements. The Democrats, on the other hand,\\n', 'while not opposing limitations clarifying the obligations of the United\\n', 'States, demanded \"the immediate ratification of the treaty without\\n', 'reservations which would impair its essential integrity.\" The Democratic\\n', 'candidate, Governor James M. Cox, of Ohio, announced his firm conviction\\n', 'that the United States should \"go into the League,\" without closing the\\n', 'door to mild reservations; he appealed to the country largely on that\\n', 'issue. The election of Senator Harding, in an extraordinary \"landslide,\"\\n', 'coupled with the return of a majority of Republicans to the Senate, made\\n', 'uncertain American participation in the League of Nations.\\n', '\\n', '=The United States and International Entanglements.=--Whether America\\n', 'entered the League or not, it could not close its doors to the world and\\n', 'escape perplexing international complications. It had ever-increasing\\n', 'financial and commercial connections with all other countries. Our\\n', 'associates in the recent war were heavily indebted to our government.\\n', 'The prosperity of American industries depended to a considerable extent\\n', 'upon the recovery of the impoverished and battle-torn countries of\\n', 'Europe.\\n', '\\n', 'There were other complications no less specific. The United States was\\n', 'compelled by force of circumstances to adopt a Russian policy. The\\n', 'government of the Czar had been overthrown by a liberal revolution,\\n', 'which in turn had been succeeded by an extreme, communist\\n', '\"dictatorship.\" The Bolsheviki, or majority faction of the socialists,\\n', 'had obtained control of the national council of peasants, workingmen,\\n', 'and soldiers, called the soviet, and inaugurated a radical regime. They\\n', 'had made peace with Germany in March, 1918. Thereupon the United States\\n', 'joined England, France, and Japan in an unofficial war upon them. After\\n', 'the general settlement at Paris in 1919, our government, while\\n', 'withdrawing troops from Siberia and Archangel, continued in its refusal\\n', 'to recognize the Bolshevists or to permit unhampered trade with them.\\n', 'President Wilson repeatedly denounced them as the enemies of\\n', 'civilization and undertook to lay down for all countries the principles\\n', 'which should govern intercourse with Russia.\\n', '\\n', 'Further international complications were created in connection with the\\n', 'World War, wholly apart from the terms of peace or the League of\\n', 'Nations. The United States had participated in a general European\\n', 'conflict which changed the boundaries of countries, called into being\\n', 'new nations, and reduced the power and territories of the vanquished.\\n', 'Accordingly, it was bound to face the problem of how far it was prepared\\n', \"to cooperate with the victors in any settlement of Europe's\\n\", 'difficulties. By no conceivable process, therefore, could America be\\n', 'disentangled from the web of world affairs. Isolation, if desirable, had\\n', 'become impossible. Within three hundred years from the founding of the\\n', 'tiny settlements at Jamestown and Plymouth, America, by virtue of its\\n', 'institutions, its population, its wealth, and its commerce, had become\\n', 'first among the nations of the earth. By moral obligations and by\\n', 'practical interests its fate was thus linked with the destiny of all\\n', 'mankind.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SUMMARY OF DEMOCRACY AND THE WORLD WAR\\n', '\\n', 'The astounding industrial progress that characterized the period\\n', 'following the Civil War bequeathed to the new generation many perplexing\\n', 'problems connected with the growth of trusts and railways, the\\n', 'accumulation of great fortunes, the increase of poverty in the\\n', 'industrial cities, the exhaustion of the free land, and the acquisition\\n', 'of dominions in distant seas. As long as there was an abundance of land\\n', 'in the West any able-bodied man with initiative and industry could\\n', 'become an independent farmer. People from the cities and immigrants from\\n', 'Europe had always before them that gateway to property and prosperity.\\n', 'When the land was all gone, American economic conditions inevitably\\n', 'became more like those of Europe.\\n', '\\n', 'Though the new economic questions had been vigorously debated in many\\n', 'circles before his day, it was President Roosevelt who first discussed\\n', 'them continuously from the White House. The natural resources of the\\n', 'country were being exhausted; he advocated their conservation. Huge\\n', 'fortunes were being made in business creating inequalities in\\n', 'opportunity; he favored reducing them by income and inheritance taxes.\\n', 'Industries were disturbed by strikes; he pressed arbitration upon\\n', 'capital and labor. The free land was gone; he declared that labor was in\\n', 'a less favorable position to bargain with capital and therefore should\\n', 'organize in unions for collective bargaining. There had been wrong-doing\\n', 'on the part of certain great trusts; those responsible should be\\n', 'punished.\\n', '\\n', 'The spirit of reform was abroad in the land. The spoils system was\\n', 'attacked. It was alleged that the political parties were dominated by\\n', '\"rings and bosses.\" The United States Senate was called \"a millionaires\\'\\n', 'club.\" Poverty and misery were observed in the cities. State\\n', 'legislatures and city governments were accused of corruption.\\n', '\\n', 'In answer to the charges, remedies were proposed and adopted. Civil\\n', 'service reform was approved. The Australian ballot, popular election of\\n', 'Senators, the initiative, referendum, and recall, commission and city\\n', 'manager plans for cities, public regulation of railways, compensation\\n', 'for those injured in industries, minimum wages for women and children,\\n', 'pensions for widows, the control of housing in the cities--these and a\\n', 'hundred other reforms were adopted and tried out. The national watchword\\n', 'became: \"America, Improve Thyself.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The spirit of reform broke into both political parties. It appeared in\\n', \"many statutes enacted by Congress under President Taft's leadership. It\\n\", 'disrupted the Republicans temporarily in 1912 when the Progressive party\\n', 'entered the field. It led the Democratic candidate in that year,\\n', 'Governor Wilson, to make a \"progressive appeal\" to the voters. It\\n', 'inspired a considerable program of national legislation under President\\n', \"Wilson's two administrations.\\n\", '\\n', 'In the age of change, four important amendments to the federal\\n', 'constitution, the first in more than forty years, were adopted. The\\n', 'sixteenth empowered Congress to lay an income tax. The seventeenth\\n', 'assured popular election of Senators. The eighteenth made prohibition\\n', 'national. The nineteenth, following upon the adoption of woman suffrage\\n', 'in many states, enfranchised the women of the nation.\\n', '\\n', 'In the sphere of industry, equally great changes took place. The major\\n', \"portion of the nation's business passed into the hands of corporations.\\n\", 'In all the leading industries of the country labor was organized into\\n', 'trade unions and federated in a national organization. The power of\\n', 'organized capital and organized labor loomed upon the horizon. Their\\n', 'struggles, their rights, and their place in the economy of the nation\\n', 'raised problems of the first magnitude.\\n', '\\n', 'While the country was engaged in a heated debate upon its domestic\\n', 'issues, the World War broke out in Europe in 1914. As a hundred years\\n', 'before, American rights upon the high seas became involved at once. They\\n', 'were invaded on both sides; but Germany, in addition to assailing\\n', 'American ships and property, ruthlessly destroyed American lives. She\\n', 'set at naught the rules of civilized warfare upon the sea. Warnings from\\n', 'President Wilson were without avail. Nothing could stay the hand of the\\n', 'German war party.\\n', '\\n', 'After long and patient negotiations, President Wilson in 1917 called\\n', 'upon the nation to take up arms against an assailant that had in effect\\n', 'declared war upon America. The answer was swift and firm. The national\\n', 'resources, human and material, were mobilized. The navy was enlarged, a\\n', 'draft army created, huge loans floated, heavy taxes laid, and the spirit\\n', 'of sacrifice called forth in a titanic struggle against an autocratic\\n', 'power that threatened to dominate Europe and the World.\\n', '\\n', 'In the end, American financial, naval, and military assistance counted\\n', 'heavily in the scale. American sailors scoured the seas searching for\\n', 'the terrible submarines. American soldiers took part in the last great\\n', \"drives that broke the might of Germany's army. Such was the nation's\\n\", 'response to the President\\'s summons to arms in a war \"for democracy\" and\\n', '\"to end war.\"\\n', '\\n', 'When victory crowned the arms of the powers united against Germany,\\n', 'President Wilson in person took part in the peace council. He sought to\\n', 'redeem his pledge to end wars by forming a League of Nations to keep the\\n', 'peace. In the treaty drawn at the close of the war the first part was a\\n', 'covenant binding the nations in a permanent association for the\\n', 'settlement of international disputes. This treaty, the President offered\\n', 'to the United States Senate for ratification and to his country for\\n', 'approval.\\n', '\\n', 'Once again, as in the days of the Napoleonic wars, the people seriously\\n', 'discussed the place of America among the powers of the earth. The Senate\\n', 'refused to ratify the treaty. World politics then became an issue in the\\n', 'campaign of 1920. Though some Americans talked as if the United States\\n', 'could close its doors and windows against all mankind, the victor in the\\n', 'election, Senator Harding, of Ohio, knew better. The election returns\\n', 'were hardly announced before he began to ask the advice of his\\n', 'countrymen on the pressing theme that would not be downed: \"What part\\n', 'shall America--first among the nations of the earth in wealth and\\n', 'power--assume at the council table of the world?\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=General References=\\n', '\\n', 'Woodrow Wilson, _The New Freedom_.\\n', '\\n', 'C.L.

First, there is the primary book, which\\n', 'is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and\\n', 'anecdotes. Second, there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth\\n', 'grade, generally speaking, an expansion of the elementary book by the\\n', 'addition of forty or fifty thousand words. Finally, there is the high\\n', 'school manual. This, too, ordinarily follows the beaten path, giving\\n', 'fuller accounts of the same events and characters. To put it bluntly, we\\n', 'do not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their\\n', 'study of history in the lower grades. If mathematicians followed the\\n', 'same method, high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the\\n', 'multiplication table and fractions.\\n', '\\n', 'There is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism advanced above. It\\n', 'is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history\\n', 'their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route. No teacher of\\n', 'history will deny this. Still it is a standing challenge to existing\\n', 'methods of historical instruction. If the study of history cannot be\\n', 'made truly progressive like the study of mathematics, science, and\\n', 'languages, then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding\\n', 'their subject to the already overloaded curriculum. If the successive\\n', 'historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text--more\\n', 'facts, more dates, more words--then history deserves most of the sharp\\n', 'criticism which it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and\\n', 'economics.\\n', '\\n', 'In this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a\\n', 'new high school text in American history. Our first contribution is one\\n', 'of omission. The time-honored stories of exploration and the\\n', 'biographies of heroes are left out. We frankly hold that, if pupils know\\n', 'little or nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John\\n', 'Smith by the time they reach the high school, it is useless to tell the\\n', 'same stories for perhaps the fourth time. It is worse than useless. It\\n', 'is an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are\\n', 'demonstrated to be progressive in character.\\n', '\\n', 'In the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles. Our\\n', 'reasons for this are simple. The strategy of a campaign or of a single\\n', 'battle is a highly technical, and usually a highly controversial, matter\\n', 'about which experts differ widely. In the field of military and naval\\n', 'operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices. To\\n', 'dispose of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is\\n', 'equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs. Any one who\\n', 'compares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign\\n', 'with the account given by Ropes, for instance, will ask for no further\\n', 'comment. No youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think\\n', 'of turning to a high school manual for information about the art of\\n', 'warfare. The dramatic scene or episode, so useful in arousing the\\n', 'interest of the immature pupil, seems out of place in a book that\\n', \"deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's\\n\", 'serious responsibilities.\\n', '\\n', 'It is not upon negative features, however, that we rest our case.

The ancient Greeks flung out their colonies in every direction,\\n', 'westward as far as Gaul, across the Mediterranean, and eastward into\\n', 'Asia Minor, perhaps to the very confines of India. The Romans, supported\\n', 'by their armies and their government, spread their dominion beyond the\\n', 'narrow lands of Italy until it stretched from the heather of Scotland to\\n', 'the sands of Arabia. The Teutonic tribes, from their home beyond the\\n', 'Danube and the Rhine, poured into the empire of the Caesars and made the\\n', 'beginnings of modern Europe. Of this great sweep of races and empires\\n', 'the settlement of America was merely a part. And it was, moreover, only\\n', 'one aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples, the\\n', 'institutions, and the trade of Europe to the very ends of the earth.\\n', '\\n', 'In one vital point, it must be noted, American colonization differed\\n', 'from that of the ancients. The Greeks usually carried with them\\n', 'affection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the\\n', 'altar of the parent city; but thousands of the immigrants who came to\\n', 'America disliked the state and disowned the church of the mother\\n', 'country. They established compacts of government for themselves and set\\n', 'up altars of their own. They sought not only new soil to till but also\\n', 'political and religious liberty for themselves and their children.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'It was no light matter for the English to cross three thousand miles of\\n', 'water and found homes in the American wilderness at the opening of the\\n', 'seventeenth century. Ships, tools, and supplies called for huge outlays\\n', 'of money. Stores had to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain\\n', 'the life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of their own.\\n', 'Artisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk\\n', 'the hazards of the new world. Soldiers were required for defense and\\n', 'mariners for the exploration of inland waters. Leaders of good judgment,\\n', 'adept in managing men, had to be discovered. Altogether such an\\n', 'enterprise demanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or\\n', 'gentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to\\n', 'assume. Though in later days, after initial tests had been made, wealthy\\n', 'proprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account, it was\\n', 'the corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the\\n', 'beginning.\\n', '\\n', '=The Trading Company.=--English pioneers in exploration found an\\n', 'instrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers, which\\n', 'had long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries.\\n', 'Such a corporation was composed of many persons of different ranks of\\n', 'society--noblemen, merchants, and gentlemen--who banded together for a\\n', 'particular undertaking, each contributing a sum of money and sharing in\\n', 'the profits of the venture. It was organized under royal authority; it\\n', 'received its charter, its grant of land, and its trading privileges from\\n', 'the king and carried on its operations under his supervision and\\n', 'control. The charter named all the persons originally included in the\\n', 'corporation and gave them certain powers in the management of its\\n', 'affairs, including the right to admit new members. The company was in\\n', 'fact a little government set up by the king. When the members of the\\n', 'corporation remained in England, as in the case of the Virginia Company,\\n', 'they operated through agents sent to the colony. When they came over the\\n', 'seas themselves and settled in America, as in the case of Massachusetts,\\n', 'they became the direct government of the country they possessed. The\\n', 'stockholders in that instance became the voters and the governor, the\\n', 'chief magistrate.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Four of the thirteen colonies in America owed their origins to the\\n', 'in 1606, that laid during the following year the foundations of Virginia\\n', 'at Jamestown. It was under the auspices of their West India Company,\\n', 'chartered in 1621, that the Dutch planted the settlements of the New\\n', 'Netherland in the valley of the Hudson. The founders of Massachusetts\\n', 'in 1629 under the title: \"The governor and company of the Massachusetts\\n', 'Bay in New England.\" In this case the law did but incorporate a group\\n', 'drawn together by religious ties. \"We must be knit together as one man,\"\\n', 'wrote John Winthrop, the first Puritan governor in America. Far to the\\n', 'south, on the banks of the Delaware River, a Swedish commercial company\\n', 'in 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement, christened New Sweden; it\\n', 'was destined to pass under the rule of the Dutch, and finally under the\\n', 'rule of William Penn as the proprietary colony of Delaware.\\n', '\\n', 'In a certain sense, Georgia may be included among the \"company\\n', 'colonies.\" It was, however, originally conceived by the moving spirit,\\n', 'James Oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor men, especially those imprisoned\\n', 'for debt. To realize this humane purpose, he secured from King George\\n', 'himself, into \"one body politic and corporate,\" known as the \"Trustees\\n', 'for establishing the colony of Georgia in America.\" In the structure of\\n', 'their organization and their methods of government, the trustees did not\\n', 'differ materially from the regular companies created for trade and\\n', 'colonization. Though their purposes were benevolent, their transactions\\n', 'had to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business.\\n', '\\n', 'the settlement of America was the religious brotherhood, or\\n', 'congregation, of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common\\n', 'religious faith. By one of the strange fortunes of history, this\\n', 'institution, founded in the early days of Christianity, proved to be a\\n', 'potent force in the origin and growth of self-government in a land far\\n', 'away from Galilee. \"And the multitude of them that believed were of one\\n', 'heart and of one soul,\" we are told in the Acts describing the Church at\\n', 'Jerusalem. \"We are knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of\\n', 'the Lord ... by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all\\n', 'care of each other\\'s good and of the whole,\" wrote John Robinson, a\\n', 'leader among the Pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of Plymouth in\\n', '1620. The Mayflower Compact, so famous in American history, was but a\\n', 'written and signed agreement, incorporating the spirit of obedience to\\n', 'the common good, which served as a guide to self-government until\\n', 'Plymouth was annexed to Massachusetts in 1691.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Three other colonies, all of which retained their identity until the eve\\n', 'of the American Revolution, likewise sprang directly from the\\n', 'congregations of the faithful: Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New\\n', 'Hampshire, mainly offshoots from Massachusetts. They were founded by\\n', 'small bodies of men and women, \"united in solemn covenants with the\\n', 'Lord,\" who planted their settlements in the wilderness. Not until many a\\n', 'year after Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson conducted their followers\\n', 'to the Narragansett country was Rhode Island granted a charter of\\n', 'incorporation (1663) by the crown. Not until long after the congregation\\n', 'of Thomas Hooker from Newtown blazed the way into the Connecticut River\\n', 'Valley did the king of England give Connecticut a charter of its own\\n', '(1662) and a place among the colonies. Half a century elapsed before the\\n', 'towns laid out beyond the Merrimac River by emigrants from Massachusetts\\n', 'were formed into the royal province of New Hampshire in 1679.\\n', '\\n', 'Even when Connecticut was chartered, the parchment and sealing wax of\\n', 'the royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of self-government\\n', 'and obedience to law previously established by the congregations. The\\n', 'towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield had long lived happily\\n', 'under their \"Fundamental Orders\" drawn up by themselves in 1639; so had\\n', 'the settlers dwelt peacefully at New Haven under their \"Fundamental\\n', 'Articles\" drafted in the same year. The pioneers on the Connecticut\\n', 'shore had no difficulty in agreeing that \"the Scriptures do hold forth a\\n', 'perfect rule for the direction and government of all men.\"\\n', '\\n', 'proprietor, or proprietary. As the name, associated with the word\\n', '\"property,\" implies, the proprietor was a person to whom the king\\n', 'granted property in lands in North America to have, hold, use, and enjoy\\n', 'for his own benefit and profit, with the right to hand the estate down\\n', 'to his heirs in perpetual succession. The proprietor was a rich and\\n', 'powerful person, prepared to furnish or secure the capital, collect the\\n', 'ships, supply the stores, and assemble the settlers necessary to found\\n', 'and sustain a plantation beyond the seas. Sometimes the proprietor\\n', 'worked alone. Sometimes two or more were associated like partners in the\\n', 'common undertaking.\\n', '\\n', 'Five colonies, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Carolinas,\\n', 'owe their formal origins, though not always their first settlements, nor\\n', 'in most cases their prosperity, to the proprietary system. Maryland,\\n', 'established in 1634 under a Catholic nobleman, Lord Baltimore, and\\n', 'blessed with religious toleration by the act of 1649, flourished under\\n', 'the mild rule of proprietors until it became a state in the American\\n', 'union. New Jersey, beginning its career under two proprietors, Berkeley\\n', 'and Carteret, in 1664, passed under the direct government of the crown\\n', 'in 1702. Pennsylvania was, in a very large measure, the product of the\\n', 'generous spirit and tireless labors of its first proprietor, the leader\\n', 'of the Friends, William Penn, to whom it was granted in 1681 and in\\n', 'whose family it remained until 1776. The two Carolinas were first\\n', 'organized as one colony in 1663 under the government and patronage of\\n', 'eight proprietors, including Lord Clarendon; but after more than half a\\n', 'century both became royal provinces governed by the king.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The English.=--In leadership and origin the thirteen colonies, except\\n', 'New York and Delaware, were English. During the early days of all, save\\n', 'these two, the main, if not the sole, current of immigration was from\\n', 'England. The colonists came from every walk of life. They were men,\\n', 'women, and children of \"all sorts and conditions.\" The major portion\\n', 'were yeomen, or small land owners, farm laborers, and artisans. With\\n', 'them were merchants and gentlemen who brought their stocks of goods or\\n', 'their fortunes to the New World. Scholars came from Oxford and\\n', 'Cambridge to preach the gospel or to teach. Now and then the son of an\\n', 'English nobleman left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with\\n', 'America. The people represented every religious faith--members of the\\n', 'Established Church of England; Puritans who had labored to reform that\\n', 'church; Separatists, Baptists, and Friends, who had left it altogether;\\n', 'and Catholics, who clung to the religion of their fathers.\\n', '\\n', 'New England was almost purely English. During the years between 1629 and\\n', '1640, the period of arbitrary Stuart government, about twenty thousand\\n', 'Puritans emigrated to America, settling in the colonies of the far\\n', 'North. Although minor additions were made from time to time, the greater\\n', 'portion of the New England people sprang from this original stock.\\n', 'Virginia, too, for a long time drew nearly all her immigrants from\\n', 'England alone. Not until the eve of the Revolution did other\\n', 'nationalities, mainly the Scotch-Irish and Germans, rival the English in\\n', 'numbers.\\n', '\\n', 'The populations of later English colonies--the Carolinas, New York,\\n', 'Pennsylvania, and Georgia--while receiving a steady stream of\\n', 'immigration from England, were constantly augmented by wanderers from\\n', 'the older settlements. New York was invaded by Puritans from New England\\n', 'in such numbers as to cause the Anglican clergymen there to lament that\\n', '\"free thinking spreads almost as fast as the Church.\" North Carolina was\\n', 'first settled toward the northern border by immigrants from Virginia.\\n', 'Some of the North Carolinians, particularly the Quakers, came all the\\n', 'way from New England, tarrying in Virginia only long enough to learn how\\n', 'little they were wanted in that Anglican colony.\\n', '\\n', '=The Scotch-Irish.=--Next to the English in numbers and influence were\\n', 'the Scotch-Irish, Presbyterians in belief, English in tongue. Both\\n', 'religious and economic reasons sent them across the sea. Their Scotch\\n', 'ancestors, in the days of Cromwell, had settled in the north of Ireland\\n', \"whence the native Irish had been driven by the conqueror's sword. There\\n\", 'the Scotch nourished for many years enjoying in peace their own form of\\n', 'religion and growing prosperous in the manufacture of fine linen and\\n', 'woolen cloth. Then the blow fell. Toward the end of the seventeenth\\n', 'century their religious worship was put under the ban and the export of\\n', 'their cloth was forbidden by the English Parliament. Within two decades\\n', 'twenty thousand Scotch-Irish left Ulster alone, for America; and all\\n', 'during the eighteenth century the migration continued to be heavy.\\n', 'Although no exact record was kept, it is reckoned that the Scotch-Irish\\n', 'and the Scotch who came directly from Scotland, composed one-sixth of\\n', 'the entire American population on the eve of the Revolution.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'These newcomers in America made their homes chiefly in New Jersey,\\n', 'Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Coming late upon\\n', 'the scene, they found much of the land immediately upon the seaboard\\n', 'already taken up. For this reason most of them became frontier people\\n', 'settling the interior and upland regions. There they cleared the land,\\n', 'laid out their small farms, and worked as \"sturdy yeomen on the soil,\"\\n', 'hardy, industrious, and independent in spirit, sharing neither the\\n', 'luxuries of the rich planters nor the easy life of the leisurely\\n', 'merchants. To their agriculture they added woolen and linen\\n', 'manufactures, which, flourishing in the supple fingers of their tireless\\n', 'women, made heavy inroads upon the trade of the English merchants in\\n', 'the colonies. Of their labors a poet has sung:\\n', '\\n', '    Strong natures tuned to the harvest-song and bound to the kindly soil;\\n', '    Bold pioneers for the wilderness, defenders in the field.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Germans.=--Third among the colonists in order of numerical\\n', 'importance were the Germans. From the very beginning, they appeared in\\n', 'Jamestown colony were of German descent. Peter Minuit, the famous\\n', 'governor of New Motherland, was a German from Wesel on the Rhine, and\\n', 'Jacob Leisler, leader of a popular uprising against the provincial\\n', 'administration of New York, was a German from Frankfort-on-Main. The\\n', 'wholesale migration of Germans began with the founding of Pennsylvania.\\n', 'Penn was diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to cultivate his\\n', 'lands and he made a special effort to attract peasants from the Rhine\\n', 'more than twenty thousand acres from him and in 1684 established a\\n', 'center at Germantown for the distribution of German immigrants. In old\\n', 'New York, Rhinebeck-on-the-Hudson became a similar center for\\n', 'distribution. All the way from Maine to Georgia inducements were offered\\n', 'to the German farmers and in nearly every colony were to be found, in\\n', 'time, German settlements. In fact the migration became so large that\\n', 'German princes were frightened at the loss of so many subjects and\\n', 'England was alarmed by the influx of foreigners into her overseas\\n', 'dominions. Yet nothing could stop the movement. By the end of the\\n', 'colonial period, the number of Germans had risen to more than two\\n', 'hundred thousand.\\n', '\\n', 'The majority of them were Protestants from the Rhine region, and South\\n', 'Germany. Wars, religious controversies, oppression, and poverty drove\\n', 'them forth to America. Though most of them were farmers, there were also\\n', 'among them skilled artisans who contributed to the rapid growth of\\n', 'industries in Pennsylvania. Their iron, glass, paper, and woolen mills,\\n', 'dotted here and there among the thickly settled regions, added to the\\n', 'wealth and independence of the province.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans did not speak the language of the\\n', 'original colonists or mingle freely with them. They kept to themselves,\\n', 'built their own schools, founded their own newspapers, and published\\n', 'their own books. Their clannish habits often irritated their neighbors\\n', 'and led to occasional agitations against \"foreigners.\" However, no\\n', 'serious collisions seem to have occurred; and in the days of the\\n', 'Revolution, German soldiers from Pennsylvania fought in the patriot\\n', 'armies side by side with soldiers from the English and Scotch-Irish\\n', 'sections.\\n', '\\n', '=Other Nationalities.=--Though the English, the Scotch-Irish, and the\\n', 'Germans made up the bulk of the colonial population, there were other\\n', 'racial strains as well, varying in numerical importance but contributing\\n', 'their share to colonial life.\\n', '\\n', 'From France came the Huguenots fleeing from the decree of the king which\\n', 'inflicted terrible penalties upon Protestants.\\n', '\\n', 'From \"Old Ireland\" came thousands of native Irish, Celtic in race and\\n', 'Catholic in religion. Like their Scotch-Irish neighbors to the north,\\n', 'they revered neither the government nor the church of England imposed\\n', 'upon them by the sword. How many came we do not know, but shipping\\n', 'records of the colonial period show that boatload after boatload left\\n', 'the southern and eastern shores of Ireland for the New World.\\n', 'Undoubtedly thousands of their passengers were Irish of the native\\n', 'stock. This surmise is well sustained by the constant appearance of\\n', 'Celtic names in the records of various colonies.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration:_From an old print_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The Jews, then as ever engaged in their age-long battle for religious\\n', 'and economic toleration, found in the American colonies, not complete\\n', 'liberty, but certainly more freedom than they enjoyed in England,\\n', 'France, Spain, or Portugal. The English law did not actually recognize\\n', 'their right to live in any of the dominions, but owing to the easy-going\\n', 'habits of the Americans they were allowed to filter into the seaboard\\n', 'towns. The treatment they received there varied. On one occasion the\\n', 'mayor and council of New York forbade them to sell by retail and on\\n', 'another prohibited the exercise of their religious worship. Newport,\\n', 'Philadelphia, and Charleston were more hospitable, and there large\\n', 'Jewish colonies, consisting principally of merchants and their families,\\n', 'flourished in spite of nominal prohibitions of the law.\\n', '\\n', 'Though the small Swedish colony in Delaware was quickly submerged\\n', 'beneath the tide of English migration, the Dutch in New York continued\\n', 'to hold their own for more than a hundred years after the English\\n', 'conquest in 1664. At the end of the colonial period over one-half of the\\n', '170,000 inhabitants of the province were descendants of the original\\n', 'Dutch--still distinct enough to give a decided cast to the life and\\n', 'manners of New York. Many of them clung as tenaciously to their mother\\n', 'tongue as they did to their capacious farmhouses or their Dutch ovens;\\n', 'but they were slowly losing their identity as the English pressed in\\n', 'beside them to farm and trade.\\n', '\\n', 'The melting pot had begun its historic mission.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Considered from one side, colonization, whatever the motives of the\\n', 'emigrants, was an economic matter. It involved the use of capital to pay\\n', 'for their passage, to sustain them on the voyage, and to start them on\\n', 'the way of production. Under this stern economic necessity, Puritans,\\n', 'Scotch-Irish, Germans, and all were alike laid.\\n', '\\n', '=Immigrants Who Paid Their Own Way.=--Many of the immigrants to America\\n', 'in colonial days were capitalists themselves, in a small or a large way,\\n', 'and paid their own passage. What proportion of the colonists were able\\n', 'to finance their voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conjecture.\\n', 'Undoubtedly a very considerable number could do so, for we can trace the\\n', 'family fortunes of many early settlers. Henry Cabot Lodge is authority\\n', 'for the statement that \"the settlers of New England were drawn from the\\n', 'country gentlemen, small farmers, and yeomanry of the mother\\n', 'country.... Many of the emigrants were men of wealth, as the old lists\\n', 'show, and all of them, with few exceptions, were men of property and\\n', 'good standing. They did not belong to the classes from which emigration\\n', 'is usually supplied, for they all had a stake in the country they left\\n', 'behind.\" Though it would be interesting to know how accurate this\\n', 'statement is or how applicable to the other colonies, no study has as\\n', 'yet been made to gratify that interest. For the present it is an\\n', 'unsolved problem just how many of the colonists were able to bear the\\n', 'cost of their own transfer to the New World.\\n', '\\n', '=Indentured Servants.=--That at least tens of thousands of immigrants\\n', 'were unable to pay for their passage is established beyond the shadow of\\n', 'a doubt by the shipping records that have come down to us. The great\\n', 'barrier in the way of the poor who wanted to go to America was the cost\\n', 'of the sea voyage. To overcome this difficulty a plan was worked out\\n', 'whereby shipowners and other persons of means furnished the passage\\n', 'money to immigrants in return for their promise, or bond, to work for a\\n', 'term of years to repay the sum advanced. This system was called\\n', 'indentured servitude.\\n', '\\n', 'It is probable that the number of bond servants exceeded the original\\n', 'twenty thousand Puritans, the yeomen, the Virginia gentlemen, and the\\n', 'Huguenots combined. All the way down the coast from Massachusetts to\\n', 'Georgia were to be found in the fields, kitchens, and workshops, men,\\n', 'women, and children serving out terms of bondage generally ranging from\\n', 'five to seven years. In the proprietary colonies the proportion of bond\\n', 'servants was very high. The Baltimores, Penns, Carterets, and other\\n', 'promoters anxiously sought for workers of every nationality to till\\n', 'their fields, for land without labor was worth no more than land in the\\n', 'moon. Hence the gates of the proprietary colonies were flung wide open.\\n', 'Every inducement was offered to immigrants in the form of cheap land,\\n', 'and special efforts were made to increase the population by importing\\n', 'servants. In Pennsylvania, it was not uncommon to find a master with\\n', 'fifty bond servants on his estate. It has been estimated that two-thirds\\n', 'of all the immigrants into Pennsylvania between the opening of the\\n', 'eighteenth century and the outbreak of the Revolution were in bondage.\\n', 'In the other Middle colonies the number was doubtless not so large; but\\n', 'it formed a considerable part of the population.\\n', '\\n', 'The story of this traffic in white servants is one of the most striking\\n', 'things in the history of labor. Bondmen differed from the serfs of the\\n', 'feudal age in that they were not bound to the soil but to the master.\\n', 'They likewise differed from the negro slaves in that their servitude had\\n', 'a time limit. Still they were subject to many special disabilities. It\\n', 'was, for instance, a common practice to impose on them penalties far\\n', 'citizen of Pennsylvania who indulged in horse racing and gambling was\\n', 'let off with a fine; a white servant guilty of the same unlawful conduct\\n', 'was whipped at the post and fined as well.\\n', '\\n', \"bondman could not marry without his master's consent; nor engage in\\n\", 'trade; nor refuse work assigned to him. For an attempt to escape or\\n', 'indeed for any infraction of the law, the term of service was extended.\\n', 'The condition of white bondmen in Virginia, according to Lodge, \"was\\n', 'little better than that of slaves. Loose indentures and harsh laws put\\n', 'them at the mercy of their masters.\" It would not be unfair to add that\\n', 'such was their lot in all other colonies. Their fate depended upon the\\n', 'temper of their masters.\\n', '\\n', 'Cruel as was the system in many ways, it gave thousands of people in the\\n', 'Old World a chance to reach the New--an opportunity to wrestle with fate\\n', 'for freedom and a home of their own. When their weary years of servitude\\n', 'were over, if they survived, they might obtain land of their own or\\n', 'settle as free mechanics in the towns. For many a bondman the gamble\\n', 'proved to be a losing venture because he found himself unable to rise\\n', 'out of the state of poverty and dependence into which his servitude\\n', 'carried him. For thousands, on the contrary, bondage proved to be a real\\n', 'avenue to freedom and prosperity. Some of the best citizens of America\\n', 'have the blood of indentured servants in their veins.\\n', '\\n', '=The Transported--Involuntary Servitude.=--In their anxiety to secure\\n', 'settlers, the companies and proprietors having colonies in America\\n', 'either resorted to or connived at the practice of kidnapping men, women,\\n', 'and children from the streets of English cities. In 1680 it was\\n', 'officially estimated that \"ten thousand persons were spirited away\" to\\n', 'America. Many of the victims of the practice were young children, for\\n', 'the traffic in them was highly profitable. Orphans and dependents were\\n', 'sometimes disposed of in America by relatives unwilling to support them.\\n', 'In a single year, 1627, about fifteen hundred children were shipped to\\n', 'Virginia.\\n', '\\n', 'In this gruesome business there lurked many tragedies, and very few\\n', 'romances. Parents were separated from their children and husbands from\\n', 'their wives. Hundreds of skilled artisans--carpenters, smiths, and\\n', 'dragged off to the New World to be sold into servitude for a term of\\n', 'five or seven years later became prosperous and returned home with\\n', 'fortunes. In one case a young man who was forcibly carried over the sea\\n', 'lived to make his way back to England and establish his claim to a\\n', 'peerage.\\n', '\\n', 'Akin to the kidnapped, at least in economic position, were convicts\\n', 'deported to the colonies for life in lieu of fines and imprisonment. The\\n', 'Americans protested vigorously but ineffectually against this practice.\\n', 'Indeed, they exaggerated its evils, for many of the \"criminals\" were\\n', \"caught shooting a rabbit on a lord's estate or a luckless servant girl\\n\", 'who purloined a pocket handkerchief was branded as a criminal along with\\n', 'sturdy thieves and incorrigible rascals. Other transported offenders\\n', 'were \"political criminals\"; that is, persons who criticized or opposed\\n', 'the government. This class included now Irish who revolted against\\n', 'British rule in Ireland; now Cavaliers who championed the king against\\n', 'the Puritan revolutionists; Puritans, in turn, dispatched after the\\n', 'monarchy was restored; and Scotch and English subjects in general who\\n', 'joined in political uprisings against the king.\\n', '\\n', '=The African Slaves.=--Rivaling in numbers, in the course of time, the\\n', 'indentured servants and whites carried to America against their will\\n', 'were the African negroes brought to America and sold into slavery. When\\n', 'this form of bondage was first introduced into Virginia in 1619, it was\\n', 'looked upon as a temporary necessity to be discarded with the increase\\n', 'of the white population. Moreover it does not appear that those planters\\n', 'who first bought negroes at the auction block intended to establish a\\n', 'system of permanent bondage. Only by a slow process did chattel slavery\\n', 'take firm root and become recognized as the leading source of the labor\\n', 'supply. In 1650, thirty years after the introduction of slavery, there\\n', 'were only three hundred Africans in Virginia.\\n', '\\n', 'The great increase in later years was due in no small measure to the\\n', 'inordinate zeal for profits that seized slave traders both in Old and in\\n', 'New England. Finding it relatively easy to secure negroes in Africa,\\n', 'they crowded the Southern ports with their vessels. The English Royal\\n', 'African Company sent to America annually between 1713 and 1743 from five\\n', 'to ten thousand slaves. The ship owners of New England were not far\\n', 'behind their English brethren in pushing this extraordinary traffic.\\n', '\\n', 'As the proportion of the negroes to the free white population steadily\\n', 'rose, and as whole sections were overrun with slaves and slave traders,\\n', 'the Southern colonies grew alarmed. In 1710, Virginia sought to curtail\\n', 'the importation by placing a duty of $5 on each slave. This effort was\\n', 'futile, for the royal governor promptly vetoed it. From time to time\\n', 'similar bills were passed, only to meet with royal disapproval. South\\n', 'Carolina, in 1760, absolutely prohibited importation; but the measure\\n', 'was killed by the British crown. As late as 1772, Virginia, not daunted\\n', '\"The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of Africa\\n', 'hath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity and under its\\n', 'present encouragement, we have too much reason to fear, will endanger\\n', \"the very existence of Your Majesty's American dominions.... Deeply\\n\", 'impressed with these sentiments, we most humbly beseech Your Majesty to\\n', \"remove all those restraints on Your Majesty's governors of this colony\\n\", 'which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very\\n', 'pernicious a commerce.\"\\n', '\\n', 'All such protests were without avail. The negro population grew by leaps\\n', 'and bounds, until on the eve of the Revolution it amounted to more than\\n', 'half a million. In five states--Maryland, Virginia, the two Carolinas,\\n', 'and Georgia--the slaves nearly equalled or actually exceeded the whites\\n', 'in number. In South Carolina they formed almost two-thirds of the\\n', 'population. Even in the Middle colonies of Delaware and Pennsylvania\\n', 'about one-fifth of the inhabitants were from Africa. To the North, the\\n', 'proportion of slaves steadily diminished although chattel servitude was\\n', 'on the same legal footing as in the South. In New York approximately one\\n', 'in six and in New England one in fifty were negroes, including a few\\n', 'freedmen.\\n', '\\n', 'The climate, the soil, the commerce, and the industry of the North were\\n', 'all unfavorable to the growth of a servile population. Still, slavery,\\n', 'though sectional, was a part of the national system of economy. Northern\\n', 'ships carried slaves to the Southern colonies and the produce of the\\n', 'plantations to Europe. \"If the Northern states will consult their\\n', 'interest, they will not oppose the increase in slaves which will\\n', 'increase the commodities of which they will become the carriers,\" said\\n', 'John Rutledge, of South Carolina, in the convention which framed the\\n', 'Constitution of the United States. \"What enriches a part enriches the\\n', 'whole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest,\"\\n', 'responded Oliver Ellsworth, the distinguished spokesman of Connecticut.\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Questions=\\n', '\\n', '1.

The feudal and\\n', 'aristocratic societies of Europe were founded on a system of landlordism\\n', 'which was characterized by two distinct features. In the first place,\\n', 'the land was nearly all held in great estates, each owned by a single\\n', 'proprietor. In the second place, every estate was kept intact under the\\n', 'law of primogeniture, which at the death of a lord transferred all his\\n', 'landed property to his eldest son. This prevented the subdivision of\\n', 'estates and the growth of a large body of small farmers or freeholders\\n', 'owning their own land. It made a form of tenantry or servitude\\n', 'inevitable for the mass of those who labored on the land. It also\\n', 'enabled the landlords to maintain themselves in power as a governing\\n', 'class and kept the tenants and laborers subject to their economic and\\n', 'political control. If land tenure was so significant in Europe, it was\\n', 'equally important in the development of America, where practically all\\n', 'the first immigrants were forced by circumstances to derive their\\n', 'livelihood from the soil.\\n', '\\n', '=Experiments in Common Tillage.=--In the New World, with its broad\\n', \"extent of land awaiting the white man's plow, it was impossible to\\n\", 'introduce in its entirety and over the whole area the system of lords\\n', 'and tenants that existed across the sea. So it happened that almost\\n', 'every kind of experiment in land tenure, from communism to feudalism,\\n', 'was tried. In the early days of the Jamestown colony, the land, though\\n', 'owned by the London Company, was tilled in common by the settlers. No\\n', 'man had a separate plot of his own. The motto of the community was:\\n', '\"Labor and share alike.\" All were supposed to work in the fields and\\n', 'receive an equal share of the produce. At Plymouth, the Pilgrims\\n', 'attempted a similar experiment, laying out the fields in common and\\n', 'distributing the joint produce of their labor with rough equality among\\n', 'the workers.\\n', '\\n', 'In both colonies the communistic experiments were failures. Angry at the\\n', 'lazy men in Jamestown who idled their time away and yet expected regular\\n', 'meals, Captain John Smith issued a manifesto: \"Everyone that gathereth\\n', 'river and forever banished from the fort and live there or starve.\" Even\\n', 'this terrible threat did not bring a change in production. Not until\\n', 'each man was given a plot of his own to till, not until each gathered\\n', 'the fruits of his own labor, did the colony prosper. In Plymouth, where\\n', 'the communal experiment lasted for five years, the results were similar\\n', 'to those in Virginia, and the system was given up for one of separate\\n', 'fields in which every person could \"set corn for his own particular.\"\\n', 'Some other New England towns, refusing to profit by the experience of\\n', 'their Plymouth neighbor, also made excursions into common ownership and\\n', 'labor, only to abandon the idea and go in for individual ownership of\\n', 'the land. \"By degrees it was seen that even the Lord\\'s people could not\\n', 'carry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome\\n', 'practice.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Feudal Elements in the Colonies--Quit Rents, Manors, and\\n', 'Plantations.=--At the other end of the scale were the feudal elements of\\n', 'land tenure found in the proprietary colonies, in the seaboard regions\\n', 'of the South, and to some extent in New York. The proprietor was in fact\\n', 'a powerful feudal lord, owning land granted to him by royal charter. He\\n', 'could retain any part of it for his personal use or dispose of it all in\\n', 'large or small lots. While he generally kept for himself an estate of\\n', 'baronial proportions, it was impossible for him to manage directly any\\n', 'considerable part of the land in his dominion. Consequently he either\\n', 'sold it in parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals on\\n', 'condition that they make to him an annual payment in money, known as\\n', '\"quit rent.\" In Maryland, the proprietor sometimes collected as high as\\n', '$9000 (equal to about $500,000 to-day) in a single year from this\\n', 'source. In Pennsylvania, the quit rents brought a handsome annual\\n', 'tribute into the exchequer of the Penn family. In the royal provinces,\\n', 'the king of England claimed all revenues collected in this form from the\\n', 'land, a sum amounting to $19,000 at the time of the Revolution. The quit\\n', 'rent,--\"really a feudal payment from freeholders,\"--was thus a material\\n', 'source of income for the crown as well as for the proprietors. Wherever\\n', 'it was laid, however, it proved to be a burden, a source of constant\\n', 'irritation; and it became a formidable item in the long list of\\n', 'grievances which led to the American Revolution.\\n', '\\n', 'Something still more like the feudal system of the Old World appeared in\\n', 'the numerous manors or the huge landed estates granted by the crown, the\\n', 'companies, or the proprietors. In the colony of Maryland alone there\\n', 'were sixty manors of three thousand acres each, owned by wealthy men and\\n', 'tilled by tenants holding small plots under certain restrictions of\\n', 'tenure. In New York also there were many manors of wide extent, most of\\n', 'which originated in the days of the Dutch West India Company, when\\n', 'extensive concessions were made to patroons to induce them to bring over\\n', 'settlers. The Van Rensselaer, the Van Cortlandt, and the Livingston\\n', 'manors were so large and populous that each was entitled to send a\\n', 'representative to the provincial legislature. The tenants on the New\\n', 'York manors were in somewhat the same position as serfs on old European\\n', 'estates. They were bound to pay the owner a rent in money and kind; they\\n', 'ground their grain at his mill; and they were subject to his judicial\\n', 'power because he held court and meted out justice, in some instances\\n', 'extending to capital punishment.\\n', '\\n', 'The manors of New York or Maryland were, however, of slight consequence\\n', 'as compared with the vast plantations of the Southern seaboard--huge\\n', 'estates, far wider in expanse than many a European barony and tilled by\\n', 'slaves more servile than any feudal tenants. It must not be forgotten\\n', 'that this system of land tenure became the dominant feature of a large\\n', 'section and gave a decided bent to the economic and political life of\\n', 'America.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Small Freehold.=--In the upland regions of the South, however, and\\n', 'throughout most of the North, the drift was against all forms of\\n', 'servitude and tenantry and in the direction of the freehold; that is,\\n', 'the small farm owned outright and tilled by the possessor and his\\n', 'family. This was favored by natural circumstances and the spirit of the\\n', 'immigrants. For one thing, the abundance of land and the scarcity of\\n', 'labor made it impossible for the companies, the proprietors, or the\\n', 'crown to develop over the whole continent a network of vast estates. In\\n', 'many sections, particularly in New England, the climate, the stony soil,\\n', 'the hills, and the narrow valleys conspired to keep the farms within a\\n', 'moderate compass. For another thing, the English, Scotch-Irish, and\\n', 'German peasants, even if they had been tenants in the Old World, did not\\n', 'propose to accept permanent dependency of any kind in the New. If they\\n', 'could not get freeholds, they would not settle at all; thus they forced\\n', 'proprietors and companies to bid for their enterprise by selling land in\\n', 'small lots. So it happened that the freehold of modest proportions\\n', 'became the cherished unit of American farmers. The people who tilled the\\n', 'farms were drawn from every quarter of western Europe; but the freehold\\n', 'system gave a uniform cast to their economic and social life in America.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Social Effects of Land Tenure.=--Land tenure and the process of western\\n', 'settlement thus developed two distinct types of people engaged in the\\n', 'same pursuit--agriculture. They had a common tie in that they both\\n', 'cultivated the soil and possessed the local interest and independence\\n', 'which arise from that occupation. Their methods and their culture,\\n', 'however, differed widely.\\n', '\\n', 'The Southern planter, on his broad acres tilled by slaves, resembled the\\n', 'English landlord on his estates more than he did the colonial farmer who\\n', 'labored with his own hands in the fields and forests. He sold his rice\\n', 'and tobacco in large amounts directly to English factors, who took his\\n', 'entire crop in exchange for goods and cash. His fine clothes,\\n', 'silverware, china, and cutlery he bought in English markets. Loving the\\n', 'ripe old culture of the mother country, he often sent his sons to Oxford\\n', 'or Cambridge for their education. In short, he depended very largely for\\n', 'his prosperity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations with the\\n', 'Old World. He did not even need market towns in which to buy native\\n', 'goods, for they were made on his own plantation by his own artisans who\\n', 'were usually gifted slaves.\\n', '\\n', 'The economic condition of the small farmer was totally different. His\\n', 'crops were not big enough to warrant direct connection with English\\n', 'factors or the personal maintenance of a corps of artisans. He needed\\n', 'local markets, and they sprang up to meet the need. Smiths, hatters,\\n', 'weavers, wagon-makers, and potters at neighboring towns supplied him\\n', 'with the rough products of their native skill. The finer goods, bought\\n', 'by the rich planter in England, the small farmer ordinarily could not\\n', 'buy. His wants were restricted to staples like tea and sugar, and\\n', 'between him and the European market stood the merchant. His community\\n', 'was therefore more self-sufficient than the seaboard line of great\\n', 'plantations. It was more isolated, more provincial, more independent,\\n', 'more American. The planter faced the Old East. The farmer faced the New\\n', 'West.\\n', '\\n', '=The Westward Movement.=--Yeoman and planter nevertheless were alike in\\n', 'one respect. Their land hunger was never appeased. Each had the eye of\\n', 'an expert for new and fertile soil; and so, north and south, as soon as\\n', 'a foothold was secured on the Atlantic coast, the current of migration\\n', 'set in westward, creeping through forests, across rivers, and over\\n', 'mountains. Many of the later immigrants, in their search for cheap\\n', 'lands, were compelled to go to the border; but in a large part the path\\n', 'breakers to the West were native Americans of the second and third\\n', 'generations. Explorers, fired by curiosity and the lure of the\\n', 'mysterious unknown, and hunters, fur traders, and squatters, following\\n', 'their own sweet wills, blazed the trail, opening paths and sending back\\n', 'stories of the new regions they traversed. Then came the regular\\n', 'settlers with lawful titles to the lands they had purchased, sometimes\\n', 'singly and sometimes in companies.\\n', '\\n', 'In Massachusetts, the westward movement is recorded in the founding of\\n', 'Springfield in 1636 and Great Barrington in 1725. By the opening of the\\n', 'eighteenth century the pioneers of Connecticut had pushed north and west\\n', 'until their outpost towns adjoined the Hudson Valley settlements. In New\\n', 'York, the inland movement was directed by the Hudson River to Albany,\\n', 'and from that old Dutch center it radiated in every direction,\\n', 'particularly westward through the Mohawk Valley. New Jersey was early\\n', 'filled to its borders, the beginnings of the present city of New\\n', 'Brunswick being made in 1681 and those of Trenton in 1685. In\\n', 'Pennsylvania, as in New York, the waterways determined the main lines of\\n', 'advance. Pioneers, pushing up through the valley of the Schuylkill,\\n', 'spread over the fertile lands of Berks and Lancaster counties, laying\\n', 'out Reading in 1748. Another current of migration was directed by the\\n', 'Susquehanna, and, in 1726, the first farmhouse was built on the bank\\n', 'where Harrisburg was later founded. Along the southern tier of counties\\n', 'a thin line of settlements stretched westward to Pittsburgh, reaching\\n', 'the upper waters of the Ohio while the colony was still under the Penn\\n', 'family.\\n', '\\n', 'In the South the westward march was equally swift. The seaboard was\\n', 'quickly occupied by large planters and their slaves engaged in the\\n', 'cultivation of tobacco and rice. The Piedmont Plateau, lying back from\\n', 'the coast all the way from Maryland to Georgia, was fed by two streams\\n', 'of migration, one westward from the sea and the other southward from the\\n', 'other colonies--Germans from Pennsylvania and Scotch-Irish furnishing\\n', 'the main supply. \"By 1770, tide-water Virginia was full to overflowing\\n', \"and the 'back country' of the Blue Ridge and the Shenandoah was fully\\n\", 'occupied. Even the mountain valleys ... were claimed by sturdy pioneers.\\n', 'Before the Declaration of Independence, the oncoming tide of\\n', 'home-seekers had reached the crest of the Alleghanies.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Beyond the mountains pioneers had already ventured, harbingers of an\\n', 'invasion that was about to break in upon Kentucky and Tennessee. As\\n', 'early as 1769 that mighty Nimrod, Daniel Boone, curious to hunt\\n', 'buffaloes, of which he had heard weird reports, passed through the\\n', 'Cumberland Gap and brought back news of a wonderful country awaiting the\\n', 'Transylvania Company, emulating the merchant adventurers of earlier\\n', 'times, secured a huge grant of territory and sought profits in quit\\n', 'rents from lands sold to farmers. By the outbreak of the Revolution\\n', 'there were several hundred people in the Kentucky region. Like the older\\n', 'colonists, they did not relish quit rents, and their opposition wrecked\\n', 'the Transylvania Company. They even carried their protests into the\\n', 'Continental Congress in 1776, for by that time they were our \"embryo\\n', 'fourteenth colony.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Though the labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming, there was\\n', 'a steady growth in industrial and commercial pursuits. Most of the\\n', 'staple industries of to-day, not omitting iron and textiles, have their\\n', 'beginnings in colonial times. Manufacturing and trade soon gave rise to\\n', 'towns which enjoyed an importance all out of proportion to their\\n', 'numbers. The great centers of commerce and finance on the seaboard\\n', 'originated in the days when the king of England was \"lord of these\\n', 'dominions.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Textile Manufacture as a Domestic Industry.=--Colonial women, in\\n', 'addition to sharing every hardship of pioneering, often the heavy labor\\n', 'of the open field, developed in the course of time a national industry\\n', 'which was almost exclusively their own. Wool and flax were raised in\\n', 'abundance in the North and South. \"Every farm house,\" says Coman, the\\n', 'economic historian, \"was a workshop where the women spun and wove the\\n', 'serges, kerseys, and linsey-woolseys which served for the common wear.\"\\n', 'By the close of the seventeenth century, New England manufactured cloth\\n', 'in sufficient quantities to export it to the Southern colonies and to\\n', 'the West Indies. As the industry developed, mills were erected for the\\n', 'more difficult process of dyeing, weaving, and fulling, but carding and\\n', 'spinning continued to be done in the home. The Dutch of New Netherland,\\n', 'the Swedes of Delaware, and the Scotch-Irish of the interior \"were not\\n', 'one whit behind their Yankee neighbors.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The importance of this enterprise to British economic life can hardly be\\n', 'overestimated. For many a century the English had employed their fine\\n', 'woolen cloth as the chief staple in a lucrative foreign trade, and the\\n', 'government had come to look upon it as an object of special interest and\\n', 'protection. When the colonies were established, both merchants and\\n', 'statesmen naturally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasing value;\\n', 'but before long the Americans, instead of buying cloth, especially of\\n', 'the coarser varieties, were making it to sell. In the place of\\n', 'customers, here were rivals. In the place of helpless reliance upon\\n', 'English markets, here was the germ of economic independence.\\n', '\\n', 'If British merchants had not discovered it in the ordinary course of\\n', 'trade, observant officers in the provinces would have conveyed the news\\n', 'to them. Even in the early years of the eighteenth century the royal\\n', 'governor of New York wrote of the industrious Americans to his home\\n', 'government: \"The consequence will be that if they can clothe themselves\\n', 'once, not only comfortably, but handsomely too, without the help of\\n', 'England, they who already are not very fond of submitting to government\\n', 'will soon think of putting in execution designs they have long harboured\\n', 'in their breasts. This will not seem strange when you consider what sort\\n', 'of people this country is inhabited by.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Iron Industry.=--Almost equally widespread was the art of iron\\n', 'working--one of the earliest and most picturesque of colonial\\n', 'industries. Lynn, Massachusetts, had a forge and skilled artisans within\\n', 'fifteen years after the founding of Boston. The smelting of iron began\\n', 'at New London and New Haven about 1658; in Litchfield county,\\n', 'Connecticut, a few years later; at Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in\\n', '1731; and near by at Lenox some thirty years after that. New Jersey had\\n', 'iron works at Shrewsbury within ten years after the founding of the\\n', 'colony in 1665. Iron forges appeared in the valleys of the Delaware and\\n', 'the Susquehanna early in the following century, and iron masters then\\n', 'laid the foundations of fortunes in a region destined to become one of\\n', 'the great iron centers of the world. Virginia began iron working in the\\n', 'year that saw the introduction of slavery. Although the industry soon\\n', 'lapsed, it was renewed and flourished in the eighteenth century.\\n', 'Governor Spotswood was called the \"Tubal Cain\" of the Old Dominion\\n', 'because he placed the industry on a firm foundation. Indeed it seems\\n', 'that every colony, except Georgia, had its iron foundry. Nails, wire,\\n', 'metallic ware, chains, anchors, bar and pig iron were made in large\\n', 'quantities; and Great Britain, by an act in 1750, encouraged the\\n', 'colonists to export rough iron to the British Islands.\\n', '\\n', '=Shipbuilding.=--Of all the specialized industries in the colonies,\\n', 'shipbuilding was the most important. The abundance of fir for masts, oak\\n', 'for timbers and boards, pitch for tar and turpentine, and hemp for rope\\n', 'made the way of the shipbuilder easy. Early in the seventeenth century a\\n', 'ship was built at New Amsterdam, and by the middle of that century\\n', 'shipyards were scattered along the New England coast at Newburyport,\\n', 'Salem, New Bedford, Newport, Providence, New London, and New Haven.\\n', 'Yards at Albany and Poughkeepsie in New York built ships for the trade\\n', 'of that colony with England and the Indies. Wilmington and Philadelphia\\n', 'soon entered the race and outdistanced New York, though unable to equal\\n', 'the pace set by New England. While Maryland, Virginia, and South\\n', 'Carolina also built ships, Southern interest was mainly confined to the\\n', 'lucrative business of producing ship materials: fir, cedar, hemp, and\\n', 'tar.\\n', '\\n', '=Fishing.=--The greatest single economic resource of New England outside\\n', 'of agriculture was the fisheries. This industry, started by hardy\\n', 'sailors from Europe, long before the landing of the Pilgrims, flourished\\n', 'under the indomitable seamanship of the Puritans, who labored with the\\n', 'net and the harpoon in almost every quarter of the Atlantic. \"Look,\"\\n', 'exclaimed Edmund Burke, in the House of Commons, \"at the manner in\\n', 'which the people of New England have of late carried on the whale\\n', 'fishery. Whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and\\n', \"behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of Hudson's Bay\\n\", \"and Davis's Straits, while we are looking for them beneath the arctic\\n\", 'circle, we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar\\n', 'cold, that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen\\n', 'serpent of the south.... Nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging\\n', 'to them than the accumulated winter of both poles. We know that, whilst\\n', 'some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of\\n', 'Africa, others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along\\n', 'the coast of Brazil. No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries. No\\n', 'climate that is not witness to their toils. Neither the perseverance of\\n', 'Holland nor the activity of France nor the dexterous and firm sagacity\\n', 'of English enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hard\\n', 'industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent\\n', 'people.\"\\n', '\\n', 'European trade was built upon it. The better quality of the fish caught\\n', 'for food was sold in the markets of Spain, Portugal, and Italy, or\\n', 'exchanged for salt, lemons, and raisins for the American market. The\\n', 'lower grades of fish were carried to the West Indies for slave\\n', 'consumption, and in part traded for sugar and molasses, which furnished\\n', 'the raw materials for the thriving rum industry of New England. These\\n', 'activities, in turn, stimulated shipbuilding, steadily enlarging the\\n', 'demand for fishing and merchant craft of every kind and thus keeping the\\n', 'shipwrights, calkers, rope makers, and other artisans of the seaport\\n', 'towns rushed with work. They also increased trade with the mother\\n', 'country for, out of the cash collected in the fish markets of Europe and\\n', 'the West Indies, the colonists paid for English manufactures. So an\\n', 'ever-widening circle of American enterprise centered around this single\\n', 'industry, the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit.\\n', '\\n', '=Oceanic Commerce and American Merchants.=--All through the eighteenth\\n', 'century, the commerce of the American colonies spread in every direction\\n', 'until it rivaled in the number of people employed, the capital engaged,\\n', 'historian has said: \"The enterprising merchants of New England developed\\n', 'a network of trade routes that covered well-nigh half the world.\" This\\n', 'commerce, destined to be of such significance in the conflict with the\\n', 'mother country, presented, broadly speaking, two aspects.\\n', '\\n', 'On the one side, it involved the export of raw materials and\\n', 'agricultural produce. The Southern colonies produced for shipping,\\n', 'tobacco, rice, tar, pitch, and pine; the Middle colonies, grain, flour,\\n', 'furs, lumber, and salt pork; New England, fish, flour, rum, furs, shoes,\\n', 'and small articles of manufacture. The variety of products was in fact\\n', 'American union, once remarked of colonial trade: \"What sort of dish will\\n', 'you make? New England will throw in fish and onions. The middle states,\\n', 'flax-seed and flour. Maryland and Virginia will add tobacco. North\\n', 'Carolina, pitch, tar, and turpentine. South Carolina, rice and indigo,\\n', 'and Georgia will sprinkle the whole composition with sawdust. Such an\\n', 'absurd jumble will you make if you attempt to form a union among such\\n', 'discordant materials as the thirteen British provinces.\"\\n', '\\n', 'On the other side, American commerce involved the import trade,\\n', 'consisting principally of English and continental manufactures, tea, and\\n', '\"India goods.\" Sugar and molasses, brought from the West Indies,\\n', 'supplied the flourishing distilleries of Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\\n', 'and Connecticut. The carriage of slaves from Africa to the Southern\\n', \"colonies engaged hundreds of New England's sailors and thousands of\\n\", 'pounds of her capital.\\n', '\\n', 'The disposition of imported goods in the colonies, though in part\\n', 'controlled by English factors located in America, employed also a large\\n', 'and important body of American merchants like the Willings and Morrises\\n', 'of Philadelphia; the Amorys, Hancocks, and Faneuils of Boston; and the\\n', 'Livingstons and Lows of New York. In their zeal and enterprise, they\\n', 'were worthy rivals of their English competitors, so celebrated for\\n', 'world-wide commercial operations. Though fully aware of the advantages\\n', 'they enjoyed in British markets and under the protection of the British\\n', 'navy, the American merchants were high-spirited and mettlesome, ready to\\n', 'contend with royal officers in order to shield American interests\\n', 'against outside interference.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Measured against the immense business of modern times, colonial commerce\\n', 'seems perhaps trivial. That, however, is not the test of its\\n', 'significance. It must be considered in relation to the growth of English\\n', 'colonial trade in its entirety--a relation which can be shown by a few\\n', 'startling figures. The whole export trade of England, including that to\\n', 'the colonies, was, in 1704, $6,509,000. On the eve of the American\\n', 'Revolution, namely, in 1772, English exports to the American colonies\\n', 'alone amounted to $6,024,000; in other words, almost as much as the\\n', 'whole foreign business of England two generations before. At the first\\n', 'date, colonial trade was but one-twelfth of the English export business;\\n', 'at the second date, it was considerably more than one-third. In 1704,\\n', 'Pennsylvania bought in English markets goods to the value of $11,459; in\\n', '1772 the purchases of the same colony amounted to $507,909. In short,\\n', 'Pennsylvania imports increased fifty times within sixty-eight years,\\n', 'amounting in 1772 to almost the entire export trade of England to the\\n', 'colonies at the opening of the century. The American colonies were\\n', 'indeed a great source of wealth to English merchants.\\n', '\\n', '=Intercolonial Commerce.=--Although the bad roads of colonial times made\\n', 'overland transportation difficult and costly, the many rivers and\\n', 'harbors along the coast favored a lively water-borne trade among the\\n', 'colonies. The Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna rivers in\\n', 'the North and the many smaller rivers in the South made it possible for\\n', 'goods to be brought from, and carried to, the interior regions in little\\n', 'sailing vessels with comparative ease. Sloops laden with manufactures,\\n', 'domestic and foreign, collected at some city like Providence, New York,\\n', 'or Philadelphia, skirted the coasts, visited small ports, and sailed up\\n', 'the navigable rivers to trade with local merchants who had for exchange\\n', 'the raw materials which they had gathered in from neighboring farms.\\n', 'Larger ships carried the grain, live stock, cloth, and hardware of New\\n', 'England to the Southern colonies, where they were traded for tobacco,\\n', 'leather, tar, and ship timber. From the harbors along the Connecticut\\n', 'shores there were frequent sailings down through Long Island Sound to\\n', 'Maryland, Virginia, and the distant Carolinas.\\n', '\\n', '=Growth of Towns.=--In connection with this thriving trade and industry\\n', 'there grew up along the coast a number of prosperous commercial centers\\n', 'which were soon reckoned among the first commercial towns of the whole\\n', 'British empire, comparing favorably in numbers and wealth with such\\n', 'ports as Liverpool and Bristol. The statistical records of that time are\\n', 'mainly guesses; but we know that Philadelphia stood first in size among\\n', 'these towns. Serving as the port of entry for Pennsylvania, Delaware,\\n', 'and western Jersey, it had drawn within its borders, just before the\\n', 'Revolution, about 25,000 inhabitants. Boston was second in rank, with\\n', 'somewhat more than 20,000 people. New York, the \"commercial capital of\\n', 'Connecticut and old East Jersey,\" was slightly smaller than Boston, but\\n', 'growing at a steady rate. The fourth town in size was Charleston, South\\n', 'Carolina, with about 10,000 inhabitants. Newport in Rhode Island, a\\n', 'center of rum manufacture and shipping, stood fifth, with a population\\n', 'of about 7000. Baltimore and Norfolk were counted as \"considerable\\n', 'towns.\" In the interior, Hartford in Connecticut, Lancaster and York in\\n', 'Pennsylvania, and Albany in New York, with growing populations and\\n', 'increasing trade, gave prophecy of an urban America away from the\\n', 'seaboard. The other towns were straggling villages. Williamsburg,\\n', 'Virginia, for example, had about two hundred houses, in which dwelt a\\n', 'dozen families of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen. Inland county\\n', 'seats often consisted of nothing more than a log courthouse, a prison,\\n', 'and one wretched inn to house judges, lawyers, and litigants during the\\n', 'sessions of the court.\\n', '\\n', 'The leading towns exercised an influence on colonial opinion all out of\\n', 'proportion to their population. They were the centers of wealth, for one\\n', 'thing; of the press and political activity, for another. Merchants and\\n', 'artisans could readily take concerted action on public questions arising\\n', 'from their commercial operations. The towns were also centers for news,\\n', 'gossip, religious controversy, and political discussion. In the market\\n', 'places the farmers from the countryside learned of British policies and\\n', 'laws, and so, mingling with the townsmen, were drawn into the main\\n', 'currents of opinion which set in toward colonial nationalism and\\n', 'independence.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Questions=\\n', '\\n', '1.

There was\\n', 'little money in private purses or public treasuries to be dedicated to\\n', 'schools, libraries, and museums. Few there were with time to read long\\n', 'and widely, and fewer still who could devote their lives to things that\\n', 'delight the eye and the mind. And yet, poor and meager as the\\n', 'intellectual life of the colonists may seem by way of comparison, heroic\\n', 'efforts were made in every community to lift the people above the plane\\n', 'of mere existence. After the first clearings were opened in the forests\\n', 'those efforts were redoubled, and with lengthening years told upon the\\n', 'thought and spirit of the land. The appearance, during the struggle with\\n', 'England, of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with history,\\n', 'political philosophy, and the arts of war, government, and diplomacy\\n', 'itself bore eloquent testimony to the high quality of the American\\n', 'intellect. No one, not even the most critical, can run through the\\n', 'writings of distinguished Americans scattered from Massachusetts to\\n', 'Georgia--the Adamses, Ellsworth, the Morrises, the Livingstons,\\n', 'Hamilton, Franklin, Washington, Madison, Marshall, Henry, the Randolphs,\\n', 'and the Pinckneys--without coming to the conclusion that there was\\n', 'something in American colonial life which fostered minds of depth and\\n', 'power. Women surmounted even greater difficulties than the men in the\\n', 'process of self-education, and their keen interest in public issues is\\n', 'evident in many a record like the _Letters_ of Mrs. John Adams to her\\n', 'husband during the Revolution; the writings of Mrs. Mercy Otis Warren,\\n', 'the sister of James Otis, who measured her pen with the British\\n', 'propagandists; and the patriot newspapers founded and managed by women.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'In the intellectual life of America, the churches assumed a role of high\\n', 'importance. There were abundant reasons for this. In many of the\\n', 'colonies--Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New England--the religious impulse\\n', 'had been one of the impelling motives in stimulating immigration. In all\\n', 'the colonies, the clergy, at least in the beginning, formed the only\\n', 'class with any leisure to devote to matters of the spirit. They preached\\n', 'on Sundays and taught school on week days. They led in the discussion of\\n', 'local problems and in the formation of political opinion, so much of\\n', 'which was concerned with the relation between church and state. They\\n', 'wrote books and pamphlets. They filled most of the chairs in the\\n', 'colleges; under clerical guidance, intellectual and spiritual, the\\n', 'Americans received their formal education. In several of the provinces\\n', 'the Anglican Church was established by law. In New England the Puritans\\n', 'were supreme, notwithstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear their\\n', 'authority. In the Middle colonies, particularly, the multiplication of\\n', 'sects made the dominance of any single denomination impossible; and in\\n', 'all of them there was a growing diversity of faith, which promised in\\n', 'time a separation of church and state and freedom of opinion.\\n', '\\n', '=The Church of England.=--Virginia was the stronghold of the English\\n', 'system of church and state. The Anglican faith and worship were\\n', 'prescribed by law, sustained by taxes imposed on all, and favored by the\\n', 'governor, the provincial councilors, and the richest planters. \"The\\n', 'Established Church,\" says Lodge, \"was one of the appendages of the\\n', 'Virginia aristocracy. They controlled the vestries and the ministers,\\n', 'and the parish church stood not infrequently on the estate of the\\n', 'planter who built and managed it.\" As in England, Catholics and\\n', 'Protestant Dissenters were at first laid under heavy disabilities. Only\\n', 'slowly and on sufferance were they admitted to the province; but when\\n', 'once they were even covertly tolerated, they pressed steadily in, until,\\n', 'by the Revolution, they outnumbered the adherents of the established\\n', 'order.\\n', '\\n', 'The Church was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxes in the\\n', 'Carolinas after 1704, and in Georgia after that colony passed directly\\n', 'under the crown in 1754--this in spite of the fact that the majority of\\n', 'the inhabitants were Dissenters. Against the protests of the Catholics\\n', 'it was likewise established in Maryland. In New York, too,\\n', 'notwithstanding the resistance of the Dutch, the Established Church was\\n', 'fostered by the provincial officials, and the Anglicans, embracing about\\n', 'one-fifteenth of the population, exerted an influence all out of\\n', 'proportion to their numbers.\\n', '\\n', 'Many factors helped to enhance the power of the English Church in the\\n', 'colonies. It was supported by the British government and the official\\n', 'class sent out to the provinces. Its bishops and archbishops in England\\n', 'were appointed by the king, and its faith and service were set forth by\\n', 'acts of Parliament. Having its seat of power in the English monarchy, it\\n', 'could hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown and so\\n', 'counteract to some extent the independent spirit that was growing up in\\n', 'America. The Church, always a strong bulwark of the state, therefore had\\n', 'a political role to play here as in England. Able bishops and far-seeing\\n', 'leaders firmly grasped this fact about the middle of the eighteenth\\n', 'century and redoubled their efforts to augment the influence of the\\n', 'Church in provincial affairs. Unhappily for their plans they failed to\\n', 'calculate in advance the effect of their methods upon dissenting\\n', 'Protestants, who still cherished memories of bitter religious conflicts\\n', 'in the mother country.\\n', '\\n', '=Puritanism in New England.=--If the established faith made for imperial\\n', 'unity, the same could not be said of Puritanism. The Plymouth Pilgrims\\n', 'had cast off all allegiance to the Anglican Church and established a\\n', 'separate and independent congregation before they came to America. The\\n', 'Puritans, essaying at first the task of reformers within the Church,\\n', 'soon after their arrival in Massachusetts, likewise flung off their yoke\\n', 'of union with the Anglicans. In each town a separate congregation was\\n', 'organized, the male members choosing the pastor, the teachers, and the\\n', 'other officers. They also composed the voters in the town meeting, where\\n', 'secular matters were determined. The union of church and government was\\n', 'thus complete, and uniformity of faith and life prescribed by law and\\n', 'enforced by civil authorities; but this worked for local autonomy\\n', 'instead of imperial unity.\\n', '\\n', 'The clergy became a powerful class, dominant through their learning and\\n', 'their fearful denunciations of the faithless. They wrote the books for\\n', 'the people to read--the famous Cotton Mather having three hundred and\\n', 'eighty-three books and pamphlets to his credit. In cooperation with the\\n', 'civil officers they enforced a strict observance of the Puritan\\n', \"Sabbath--a day of rest that began at six o'clock on Saturday evening and\\n\", 'lasted until sunset on Sunday. All work, all trading, all amusement, and\\n', 'all worldly conversation were absolutely prohibited during those hours.\\n', 'was in danger of being banished as a vagabond. Robert Pike, a devout\\n', 'Puritan, thinking the sun had gone to rest, ventured forth on horseback\\n', 'one Sunday evening and was luckless enough to have a ray of light strike\\n', 'him through a rift in the clouds. The next day he was brought into court\\n', 'and fined for \"his ungodly conduct.\" With persons accused of witchcraft\\n', 'the Puritans were still more ruthless. When a mania of persecution swept\\n', 'over Massachusetts in 1692, eighteen people were hanged, one was pressed\\n', 'to death, many suffered imprisonment, and two died in jail.\\n', '\\n', 'Just about this time, however, there came a break in the uniformity of\\n', 'Puritan rule. The crown and church in England had long looked upon it\\n', 'wrested from the Puritans of the colony the right to elect their own\\n', 'governor and reserved the power of appointment to the king. It also\\n', 'abolished the rule limiting the suffrage to church members, substituting\\n', 'for it a simple property qualification. Thus a royal governor and an\\n', 'official family, certain to be Episcopalian in faith and monarchist in\\n', 'sympathies, were forced upon Massachusetts; and members of all religious\\n', 'denominations, if they had the required amount of property, were\\n', 'permitted to take part in elections. By this act in the name of the\\n', 'crown, the Puritan monopoly was broken down in Massachusetts, and that\\n', 'province was brought into line with Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New\\n', 'Hampshire, where property, not religious faith, was the test for the\\n', 'suffrage.\\n', '\\n', '=Growth of Religious Toleration.=--Though neither the Anglicans of\\n', 'Virginia nor the Puritans of Massachusetts believed in toleration for\\n', 'other denominations, that principle was strictly applied in Rhode\\n', 'Island. There, under the leadership of Roger Williams, liberty in\\n', 'matters of conscience was established in the beginning. Maryland, by\\n', 'granting in 1649 freedom to those who professed to believe in Jesus\\n', 'Christ, opened its gates to all Christians; and Pennsylvania, true to\\n', 'the tenets of the Friends, gave freedom of conscience to those \"who\\n', 'confess and acknowledge the one Almighty and Eternal God to be the\\n', 'creator, upholder, and ruler of the World.\" By one circumstance or\\n', 'another, the Middle colonies were thus early characterized by diversity\\n', 'rather than uniformity of opinion. Dutch Protestants, Huguenots,\\n', 'Quakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, New Lights, Moravians, Lutherans,\\n', 'Catholics, and other denominations became too strongly intrenched and\\n', 'too widely scattered to permit any one of them to rule, if it had\\n', 'desired to do so. There were communities and indeed whole sections where\\n', 'one or another church prevailed, but in no colony was a legislature\\n', 'steadily controlled by a single group. Toleration encouraged diversity,\\n', 'and diversity, in turn, worked for greater toleration.\\n', '\\n', 'The government and faith of the dissenting denominations conspired with\\n', 'economic and political tendencies to draw America away from the English\\n', 'state. Presbyterians, Quakers, Baptists, and Puritans had no hierarchy\\n', 'of bishops and archbishops to bind them to the seat of power in London.\\n', 'Neither did they look to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting\\n', 'articles of faith. Local self-government in matters ecclesiastical\\n', 'helped to train them for local self-government in matters political. The\\n', 'spirit of independence which led Dissenters to revolt in the Old World,\\n', 'nourished as it was amid favorable circumstances in the New World, made\\n', 'them all the more zealous in the defense of every right against\\n', 'authority imposed from without.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Religion and Local Schools.=--One of the first cares of each Protestant\\n', 'denomination was the education of the children in the faith. In this\\n', 'work the Bible became the center of interest. The English version was\\n', 'indeed the one book of the people. Farmers, shopkeepers, and artisans,\\n', 'whose life had once been bounded by the daily routine of labor, found in\\n', 'the Scriptures not only an inspiration to religious conduct, but also a\\n', 'book of romance, travel, and history. \"Legend and annal,\" says John\\n', 'Richard Green, \"war-song and psalm, state-roll and biography, the mighty\\n', 'voices of prophets, the parables of Evangelists, stories of mission\\n', 'journeys, of perils by sea and among the heathen, philosophic arguments,\\n', 'apocalyptic visions, all were flung broadcast over minds unoccupied for\\n', 'the most part by any rival learning.... As a mere literary monument, the\\n', 'English version of the Bible remains the noblest example of the English\\n', 'tongue.\" It was the King James version just from the press that the\\n', 'Pilgrims brought across the sea with them.\\n', '\\n', 'For the authority of the Established Church was substituted the\\n', 'authority of the Scriptures. The Puritans devised a catechism based upon\\n', 'their interpretation of the Bible, and, very soon after their arrival in\\n', 'America, they ordered all parents and masters of servants to be diligent\\n', 'in seeing that their children and wards were taught to read religious\\n', 'works and give answers to the religious questions. Massachusetts was\\n', 'scarcely twenty years old before education of this character was\\n', 'declared to be compulsory, and provision was made for public schools\\n', 'where those not taught at home could receive instruction in reading and\\n', 'writing.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '       We sinned all.\\n', '\\n', '       The Bible Mind.\\n', '\\n', \"       For sinners dy'd.\\n\", '\\n', '       The Earth around.\\n', '\\n', '       by Ravens fed.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Outside of New England the idea of compulsory education was not regarded\\n', 'with the same favor; but the whole land was nevertheless dotted with\\n', 'little schools kept by \"dames, itinerant teachers, or local parsons.\"\\n', 'Whether we turn to the life of Franklin in the North or Washington in\\n', 'the South, we read of tiny schoolhouses, where boys, and sometimes\\n', 'girls, were taught to read and write. Where there were no schools,\\n', 'fathers and mothers of the better kind gave their children the rudiments\\n', 'of learning. Though illiteracy was widespread, there is evidence to show\\n', 'that the diffusion of knowledge among the masses was making steady\\n', 'progress all through the eighteenth century.\\n', '\\n', '=Religion and Higher Learning.=--Religious motives entered into the\\n', 'establishment of colleges as well as local schools. Harvard, founded in\\n', '1636, and Yale, opened in 1718, were intended primarily to train\\n', '\"learned and godly ministers\" for the Puritan churches of New England.\\n', 'To the far North, Dartmouth, chartered in 1769, was designed first as a\\n', 'mission to the Indians and then as a college for the sons of New England\\n', 'farmers preparing to preach, teach, or practice law. The College of New\\n', 'Jersey, organized in 1746 and removed to Princeton eleven years later,\\n', 'was sustained by the Presbyterians. Two colleges looked to the\\n', 'Established Church as their source of inspiration and support: William\\n', \"and Mary, founded in Virginia in 1693, and King's College, now Columbia\\n\", 'New York Anglicans, alarmed at the growth of religious dissent and the\\n', '\"republican tendencies\" of the age. Two colleges revealed a drift away\\n', 'from sectarianism. Brown, established in Rhode Island in 1764, and the\\n', 'Philadelphia Academy, forerunner of the University of Pennsylvania,\\n', 'organized by Benjamin Franklin, reflected the spirit of toleration by\\n', 'giving representation on the board of trustees to several religious\\n', \"sects. It was Franklin's idea that his college should prepare young men\\n\", 'to serve in public office as leaders of the people and ornaments to\\n', 'their country.\\n', '\\n', '=Self-education in America.=--Important as were these institutions of\\n', 'learning, higher education was by no means confined within their walls.\\n', 'Many well-to-do families sent their sons to Oxford or Cambridge in\\n', 'England. Private tutoring in the home was common. In still more families\\n', 'there were intelligent children who grew up in the great colonial school\\n', 'of adversity and who trained themselves until, in every contest of mind\\n', 'and wit, they could vie with the sons of Harvard or William and Mary or\\n', 'any other college. Such, for example, was Benjamin Franklin, whose\\n', 'charming autobiography, in addition to being an American classic, is a\\n', 'fine record of self-education. His formal training in the classroom was\\n', 'limited to a few years at a local school in Boston; but his\\n', 'self-education continued throughout his life. He early manifested a zeal\\n', \"for reading, and devoured, he tells us, his father's dry library on\\n\", \"theology, Bunyan's works, Defoe's writings, Plutarch's _Lives_, Locke's\\n\", '_On the Human Understanding_, and innumerable volumes dealing with\\n', 'secular subjects. His literary style, perhaps the best of his time,\\n', 'Franklin acquired by the diligent and repeated analysis of the\\n', '_Spectator_. In a life crowded with labors, he found time to read widely\\n', 'in natural science and to win single-handed recognition at the hands of\\n', 'European savants for his discoveries in electricity. By his own efforts\\n', 'he \"attained an acquaintance\" with Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish,\\n', 'thus unconsciously preparing himself for the day when he was to speak\\n', 'for all America at the court of the king of France.\\n', '\\n', 'Lesser lights than Franklin, educated by the same process, were found\\n', 'all over colonial America. From this fruitful source of native ability,\\n', 'self-educated, the American cause drew great strength in the trials of\\n', 'the Revolution.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Rise of the Newspaper.=--The evolution of American democracy into a\\n', 'government by public opinion, enlightened by the open discussion of\\n', 'political questions, was in no small measure aided by a free press. That\\n', 'brought to Massachusetts in 1639, but it was put in charge of an\\n', 'official censor and limited to the publication of religious works. Forty\\n', 'years elapsed before the first newspaper appeared, bearing the curious\\n', 'title, _Public Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestic_, and it had not\\n', 'been running very long before the government of Massachusetts suppressed\\n', 'it for discussing a political question.\\n', '\\n', 'Publishing, indeed, seemed to be a precarious business; but in 1704\\n', 'there came a second venture in journalism, _The Boston News-Letter_,\\n', 'which proved to be a more lasting enterprise because it refrained from\\n', 'criticizing the authorities. Still the public interest languished. When\\n', \"Franklin's brother, James, began to issue his _New England Courant_\\n\", 'about 1720, his friends sought to dissuade him, saying that one\\n', 'newspaper was enough for America. Nevertheless he continued it; and his\\n', 'confidence in the future was rewarded. In nearly every colony a gazette\\n', 'or chronicle appeared within the next thirty years or more. Benjamin\\n', 'Franklin was able to record in 1771 that America had twenty-five\\n', 'newspapers. Boston led with five. Philadelphia had three: two in English\\n', 'and one in German.\\n', '\\n', '=Censorship and Restraints on the Press.=--The idea of printing,\\n', 'unlicensed by the government and uncontrolled by the church, was,\\n', 'however, slow in taking form. The founders of the American colonies had\\n', 'never known what it was to have the free and open publication of books,\\n', 'pamphlets, broadsides, and newspapers. When the art of printing was\\n', 'first discovered, the control of publishing was vested in clerical\\n', 'authorities. After the establishment of the State Church in England in\\n', 'the reign of Elizabeth, censorship of the press became a part of royal\\n', 'prerogative. Printing was restricted to Oxford, Cambridge, and London;\\n', 'and no one could publish anything without previous approval of the\\n', 'official censor. When the Puritans were in power, the popular party,\\n', 'with a zeal which rivaled that of the crown, sought, in turn, to silence\\n', 'royalist and clerical writers by a vigorous censorship. After the\\n', 'restoration of the monarchy, control of the press was once more placed\\n', 'in royal hands, where it remained until 1695, when Parliament, by\\n', 'failing to renew the licensing act, did away entirely with the official\\n', '\\n', 'censorship. By that time political parties were so powerful and so\\n', 'active and printing presses were so numerous that official review of all\\n', 'published matter became a sheer impossibility.\\n', '\\n', 'In America, likewise, some troublesome questions arose in connection\\n', 'with freedom of the press. The Puritans of Massachusetts were no less\\n', 'anxious than King Charles or the Archbishop of London to shut out from\\n', 'the prying eyes of the people all literature \"not mete for them to\\n', 'read\"; and so they established a system of official licensing for\\n', 'presses, which lasted until 1755. In the other colonies where there was\\n', 'more diversity of opinion and publishers could set up in business with\\n', 'impunity, they were nevertheless constantly liable to arrest for\\n', 'printing anything displeasing to the colonial governments. In 1721 the\\n', 'editor of the _Mercury_ in Philadelphia was called before the\\n', 'proprietary council and ordered to apologize for a political article,\\n', 'and for a later offense of a similar character he was thrown into jail.\\n', 'who was arrested in 1735 for criticising the administration. Lawyers who\\n', 'ventured to defend the unlucky editor were deprived of their licenses to\\n', 'practice, and it became necessary to bring an attorney all the way from\\n', 'Philadelphia. By this time the tension of feeling was high, and the\\n', 'approbation of the public was forthcoming when the lawyer for the\\n', 'defense exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of liberty itself, not\\n', 'that of the poor printer, was on trial! The verdict for Zenger, when it\\n', 'finally came, was the signal for an outburst of popular rejoicing.\\n', \"Already the people of King George's province knew how precious a thing\\n\", 'is the freedom of the press.\\n', '\\n', 'Thanks to the schools, few and scattered as they were, and to the\\n', 'vigilance of parents, a very large portion, perhaps nearly one-half, of\\n', 'the colonists could read. Through the newspapers, pamphlets, and\\n', 'almanacs that streamed from the types, the people could follow the\\n', 'course of public events and grasp the significance of political\\n', 'arguments. An American opinion was in the process of making--an\\n', 'independent opinion nourished by the press and enriched by discussions\\n', 'around the fireside and at the taverns. When the day of resistance to\\n', 'British rule came, government by opinion was at hand. For every person\\n', 'who could hear the voice of Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, there were a\\n', 'thousand who could see their appeals on the printed page. Men who had\\n', \"spelled out their letters while poring over Franklin's _Poor Richard's\\n\", \"Almanac_ lived to read Thomas Paine's thrilling call to arms.\\n\", '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Two very distinct lines of development appeared in colonial politics.\\n', 'The one, exalting royal rights and aristocratic privileges, was the\\n', 'drift toward provincial government through royal officers appointed in\\n', 'England. The other, leading toward democracy and self-government, was\\n', 'the growth in the power of the popular legislative assembly. Each\\n', 'movement gave impetus to the other, with increasing force during the\\n', 'passing years, until at last the final collision between the two ideals\\n', 'of government came in the war of independence.\\n', '\\n', '=The Royal Provinces.=--Of the thirteen English colonies eight were\\n', 'royal provinces in 1776, with governors appointed by the king. Virginia\\n', 'passed under the direct rule of the crown in 1624, when the charter of\\n', 'the London Company was annulled. The Massachusetts Bay corporation lost\\n', 'its charter in 1684, and the new instrument granted seven years later\\n', 'stripped the colonists of the right to choose their chief executive. In\\n', 'the early decades of the eighteenth century both the Carolinas were\\n', 'given the provincial instead of the proprietary form. New Hampshire,\\n', 'severed from Massachusetts in 1679, and Georgia, surrendered by the\\n', 'trustees in 1752, went into the hands of the crown. New York,\\n', 'transferred to the Duke of York on its capture from the Dutch in 1664,\\n', 'Jersey, after remaining for nearly forty years under proprietors, was\\n', 'brought directly under the king in 1702. Maryland, Pennsylvania, and\\n', 'Delaware, although they retained their proprietary character until the\\n', 'Revolution, were in some respects like the royal colonies, for their\\n', 'governors were as independent of popular choice as were the appointees\\n', 'of King George. Only two colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut,\\n', 'retained full self-government on the eve of the Revolution. They alone\\n', 'had governors and legislatures entirely of their own choosing.\\n', '\\n', 'The chief officer of the royal province was the governor, who enjoyed\\n', 'high and important powers which he naturally sought to augment at every\\n', 'turn. He enforced the laws and, usually with the consent of a council,\\n', 'appointed the civil and military officers. He granted pardons and\\n', 'reprieves; he was head of the highest court; he was commander-in-chief\\n', 'of the militia; he levied troops for defense and enforced martial law in\\n', 'time of invasion, war, and rebellion. In all the provinces, except\\n', 'Massachusetts, he named the councilors who composed the upper house of\\n', 'the legislature and was likely to choose those who favored his claims.\\n', 'He summoned, adjourned, and dissolved the popular assembly, or the lower\\n', 'house; he laid before it the projects of law desired by the crown; and\\n', 'he vetoed measures which he thought objectionable. Here were in America\\n', 'all the elements of royal prerogative against which Hampden had\\n', 'protested and Cromwell had battled in England.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The colonial governors were generally surrounded by a body of\\n', 'office-seekers and hunters for land grants. Some of them were noblemen\\n', 'of broken estates who had come to America to improve their fortunes. The\\n', 'pretensions of this circle grated on colonial nerves, and privileges\\n', 'granted to them, often at the expense of colonists, did much to deepen\\n', 'popular antipathy to the British government. Favors extended to\\n', 'adherents of the Established Church displeased Dissenters. The\\n', 'reappearance of this formidable union of church and state, from which\\n', 'they had fled, stirred anew the ancient wrath against that combination.\\n', '\\n', '=The Colonial Assembly.=--Coincident with the drift toward\\n', 'administration through royal governors was the second and opposite\\n', 'tendency, namely, a steady growth in the practice of self-government.\\n', 'The voters of England had long been accustomed to share in taxation and\\n', 'law-making through representatives in Parliament, and the idea was early\\n', 'introduced in America. Virginia was only twelve years old (1619) when\\n', 'its first representative assembly appeared. As the towns of\\n', 'Massachusetts multiplied and it became impossible for all the members of\\n', 'the corporation to meet at one place, the representative idea was\\n', 'adopted, in 1633. The river towns of Connecticut formed a representative\\n', 'system under their \"Fundamental Orders\" of 1639, and the entire colony\\n', 'was given a royal charter in 1662. Generosity, as well as practical\\n', 'considerations, induced such proprietors as Lord Baltimore and William\\n', 'Penn to invite their colonists to share in the government as soon as any\\n', 'considerable settlements were made. Thus by one process or another every\\n', 'one of the colonies secured a popular assembly.\\n', '\\n', 'It is true that in the provision for popular elections, the suffrage was\\n', 'finally restricted to property owners or taxpayers, with a leaning\\n', 'toward the freehold qualification. In Virginia, the rural voter had to\\n', 'be a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land, if there was no\\n', 'house on it, or twenty-five acres with a house twenty-five feet square.\\n', 'In Massachusetts, the voter for member of the assembly under the charter\\n', 'of 1691 had to be a freeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year\\n', 'at least or of other property to the value of forty pounds sterling. In\\n', 'Pennsylvania, the suffrage was granted to freeholders owning fifty acres\\n', 'or more of land well seated, twelve acres cleared, and to other persons\\n', 'worth at least fifty pounds in lawful money.\\n', '\\n', 'Restrictions like these undoubtedly excluded from the suffrage a very\\n', 'considerable number of men, particularly the mechanics and artisans of\\n', 'the towns, who were by no means content with their position.\\n', 'Nevertheless, it was relatively easy for any man to acquire a small\\n', 'freehold, so cheap and abundant was land; and in fact a large proportion\\n', 'of the colonists were land owners. Thus the assemblies, in spite of the\\n', 'limited suffrage, acquired a democratic tone.\\n', '\\n', 'The popular character of the assemblies increased as they became engaged\\n', 'in battles with the royal and proprietary governors. When called upon by\\n', 'the executive to make provision for the support of the administration,\\n', 'the legislature took advantage of the opportunity to make terms in the\\n', 'interest of the taxpayers. It made annual, not permanent, grants of\\n', 'money to pay official salaries and then insisted upon electing a\\n', 'treasurer to dole it out. Thus the colonists learned some of the\\n', 'mysteries of public finance, as well as the management of rapacious\\n', 'officials. The legislature also used its power over money grants to\\n', 'force the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise have vetoed.\\n', '\\n', '=Contests between Legislatures and Governors.=--As may be imagined, many\\n', 'and bitter were the contests between the royal and proprietary governors\\n', 'and the colonial assemblies. Franklin relates an amusing story of how\\n', 'the Pennsylvania assembly held in one hand a bill for the executive to\\n', 'sign and, in the other hand, the money to pay his salary. Then, with sly\\n', 'humor, Franklin adds: \"Do not, my courteous reader, take pet at our\\n', 'proprietary constitution for these our bargain and sale proceedings in\\n', 'legislation. It is a happy country where justice and what was your own\\n', 'before can be had for ready money. It is another addition to the value\\n', 'of money and of course another spur to industry. Every land is not so\\n', 'blessed.\"\\n', '\\n', 'It must not be thought, however, that every governor got off as easily\\n', \"as Franklin's tale implies. On the contrary, the legislatures, like\\n\", 'Caesar, fed upon meat that made them great and steadily encroached upon\\n', 'executive prerogatives as they tried out and found their strength. If\\n', 'we may believe contemporary laments, the power of the crown in America\\n', 'was diminishing when it was struck down altogether. In New York, the\\n', 'friends of the governor complained in 1747 that \"the inhabitants of\\n', 'plantations are generally educated in republican principles; upon\\n', 'republican principles all is conducted. Little more than a shadow of\\n', 'royal authority remains in the Northern colonies.\" \"Here,\" echoed the\\n', 'governor of South Carolina, the following year, \"levelling principles\\n', 'prevail; the frame of the civil government is unhinged; a governor, if\\n', 'he would be idolized, must betray his trust; the people have got their\\n', 'whole administration in their hands; the election of the members of the\\n', 'assembly is by ballot; not civil posts only, but all ecclesiastical\\n', 'preferments, are in the disposal or election of the people.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Though baffled by the \"levelling principles\" of the colonial assemblies,\\n', 'the governors did not give up the case as hopeless. Instead they evolved\\n', 'a system of policy and action which they thought could bring the\\n', 'obstinate provincials to terms. That system, traceable in their letters\\n', 'to the government in London, consisted of three parts: (1) the royal\\n', 'officers in the colonies were to be made independent of the legislatures\\n', 'by taxes imposed by acts of Parliament; (2) a British standing army was\\n', 'be revoked and government by direct royal authority was to be enlarged.\\n', '\\n', 'ministers of the crown in London. With governors, courts, and an army\\n', 'independent of the colonists, they imagined it would be easy to carry\\n', 'out both royal orders and acts of Parliament. This reasoning seemed both\\n', 'practical and logical. Nor was it founded on theory, for it came fresh\\n', 'from the governors themselves. It was wanting in one respect only. It\\n', 'failed to take account of the fact that the American people were growing\\n', 'strong in the practice of self-government and could dispense with the\\n', 'tutelage of the British ministry, no matter how excellent it might be or\\n', 'how benevolent its intentions.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Studies).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Benjamin Franklin, _Autobiography_.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '(Pennsylvania University Studies).\\n', '\\n', '(2 vols.).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Questions=\\n', '\\n', '1.

As the difficulties\\n', 'arose mainly on the frontiers, where the restless and pushing pioneers\\n', 'were making their way with gun and ax, nearly everything that happened\\n', 'between traders and an Indian, a jug of whisky, a keg of gunpowder, the\\n', 'exchange of guns for furs, personal treachery, or a flash of bad temper\\n', 'often set in motion destructive forces of the most terrible character.\\n', '\\n', 'On one side of the ledger may be set innumerable generous records--of\\n', 'Squanto and Samoset teaching the Pilgrims the ways of the wilds; of\\n', 'Roger Williams buying his lands from the friendly natives; or of William\\n', 'Penn treating with them on his arrival in America. On the other side of\\n', 'the ledger must be recorded many a cruel and bloody conflict as the\\n', 'frontier rolled westward with deadly precision. The Pequots on the\\n', 'Connecticut border, sensing their doom, fell upon the tiny settlements\\n', 'generation later, King Philip, son of Massasoit, the friend of the\\n', 'Pilgrims, called his tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought\\n', 'the strength of all New England to the field and ended in his own\\n', 'destruction. In New York, the relations with the Indians, especially\\n', 'with the Algonquins and the Mohawks, were marked by periodic and\\n', 'desperate wars. Virginia and her Southern neighbors suffered as did New\\n', 'England. In 1622 Opecacano, a brother of Powhatan, the friend of the\\n', 'Jamestown settlers, launched a general massacre; and in 1644 he\\n', 'attempted a war of extermination. In 1675 the whole frontier was ablaze.\\n', 'Nathaniel Bacon vainly attempted to stir the colonial governor to put up\\n', 'an adequate defense and, failing in that plea, himself headed a revolt\\n', 'and a successful expedition against the Indians. As the Virginia\\n', 'outposts advanced into the Kentucky country, the strife with the natives\\n', 'was transferred to that \"dark and bloody ground\"; while to the\\n', 'southeast, a desperate struggle with the Tuscaroras called forth the\\n', 'combined forces of the two Carolinas and Virginia.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'From such horrors New Jersey and Delaware were saved on account of their\\n', 'geographical location. Pennsylvania, consistently following a policy of\\n', 'conciliation, was likewise spared until her western vanguard came into\\n', 'full conflict with the allied French and Indians. Georgia, by clever\\n', 'negotiations and treaties of alliance, managed to keep on fair terms\\n', 'with her belligerent Cherokees and Creeks. But neither diplomacy nor\\n', 'generosity could stay the inevitable conflict as the frontier advanced,\\n', 'especially after the French soldiers enlisted the Indians in their\\n', 'imperial enterprises. It was then that desultory fighting became general\\n', 'warfare.\\n', '\\n', '1750]\\n', '\\n', '=Early Relations with the French.=--During the first decades of French\\n', 'exploration and settlement in the St. Lawrence country, the English\\n', 'colonies, engrossed with their own problems, gave little or no thought\\n', 'to their distant neighbors. Quebec, founded in 1608, and Montreal, in\\n', '1642, were too far away, too small in population, and too slight in\\n', 'strength to be much of a menace to Boston, Hartford, or New York. It was\\n', 'the statesmen in France and England, rather than the colonists in\\n', 'America, who first grasped the significance of the slowly converging\\n', 'rather than the labors of Jesuit missionaries and French rangers, that\\n', 'sounded the first note of colonial alarm.\\n', '\\n', 'Evidence of this lies in the fact that three conflicts between the\\n', 'English and the French occurred before their advancing frontiers met on\\n', \"the Pennsylvania border. King William's War (1689-1697), Queen Anne's\\n\", \"War (1701-1713), and King George's War (1744-1748) owed their origins\\n\", 'and their endings mainly to the intrigues and rivalries of European\\n', 'powers, although they all involved the American colonies in struggles\\n', 'with the French and their savage allies.\\n', '\\n', '=The Clash in the Ohio Valley.=--The second of these wars had hardly\\n', 'closed, however, before the English colonists themselves began to be\\n', 'seriously alarmed about the rapidly expanding French dominion in the\\n', 'West. Marquette and Joliet, who opened the Lake region, and La Salle,\\n', 'who in 1682 had gone down the Mississippi to the Gulf, had been followed\\n', 'by the builders of forts. In 1718, the French founded New Orleans, thus\\n', 'taking possession of the gateway to the Mississippi as well as the St.\\n', 'occupied Crown Point; in 1749 they formally announced their dominion\\n', 'over all the territory drained by the Ohio River. Having asserted this\\n', 'lofty claim, they set out to make it good by constructing in the years\\n', '1752-1754 Fort Le Boeuf near Lake Erie, Fort Venango on the upper\\n', 'waters of the Allegheny, and Fort Duquesne at the junction of the\\n', 'streams forming the Ohio. Though they were warned by George Washington,\\n', 'in the name of the governor of Virginia, to keep out of territory \"so\\n', 'notoriously known to be property of the crown of Great Britain,\" the\\n', 'French showed no signs of relinquishing their pretensions.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Final Phase--the French and Indian War.=--Thus it happened that the\\n', \"shot which opened the Seven Years' War, known in America as the French\\n\", 'and Indian War, was fired in the wilds of Pennsylvania. There began the\\n', 'conflict that spread to Europe and even Asia and finally involved\\n', 'England and Prussia, on the one side, and France, Austria, Spain, and\\n', 'minor powers on the other. On American soil, the defeat of Braddock in\\n', \"1755 and Wolfe's exploit in capturing Quebec four years later were the\\n\", 'dramatic features. On the continent of Europe, England subsidized\\n', 'Prussian arms to hold France at bay. In India, on the banks of the\\n', 'Ganges, as on the banks of the St. Lawrence, British arms were\\n', 'triumphant. Well could the historian write: \"Conquests equaling in\\n', 'rapidity and far surpassing in magnitude those of Cortes and Pizarro had\\n', 'been achieved in the East.\" Well could the merchants of London declare\\n', 'that under the administration of William Pitt, the imperial genius of\\n', 'this world-wide conflict, commerce had been \"united with and made to\\n', 'flourish by war.\"\\n', '\\n', 'From the point of view of the British empire, the results of the war\\n', 'were momentous. By the peace of 1763, Canada and the territory east of\\n', 'the Mississippi, except New Orleans, passed under the British flag. The\\n', 'remainder of the Louisiana territory was transferred to Spain and French\\n', 'imperial ambitions on the American continent were laid to rest. In\\n', 'exchange for Havana, which the British had seized during the war, Spain\\n', 'ceded to King George the colony of Florida. Not without warrant did\\n', 'Macaulay write in after years that Pitt \"was the first Englishman of his\\n', 'time; and he had made England the first country in the world.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The various wars with the French and the Indians, trivial in detail as\\n', 'they seem to-day, had a profound influence on colonial life and on the\\n', 'destiny of America. Circumstances beyond the control of popular\\n', 'assemblies, jealous of their individual powers, compelled cooperation\\n', 'among them, grudging and stingy no doubt, but still cooperation. The\\n', 'American people, more eager to be busy in their fields or at their\\n', 'trades, were simply forced to raise and support armies, to learn the\\n', 'arts of warfare, and to practice, if in a small theater, the science of\\n', 'statecraft. These forces, all cumulative, drove the colonists, so\\n', 'tenaciously provincial in their habits, in the direction of nationalism.\\n', '\\n', '=The New England Confederation.=--It was in their efforts to deal with\\n', 'the problems presented by the Indian and French menace that the\\n', 'Americans took the first steps toward union. Though there were many\\n', 'common ties among the settlers of New England, it required a deadly\\n', 'fear of the Indians to produce in 1643 the New England Confederation,\\n', 'composed of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven. The\\n', 'colonies so united were bound together in \"a firm and perpetual league\\n', 'of friendship and amity for offense and defense, mutual service and\\n', 'succor, upon all just occasions.\" They made provision for distributing\\n', 'the burdens of wars among the members and provided for a congress of\\n', 'commissioners from each colony to determine upon common policies. For\\n', 'some twenty years the Confederation was active and it continued to hold\\n', 'meetings until after the extinction of the Indian peril on the immediate\\n', 'border.\\n', '\\n', 'Virginia, no less than Massachusetts, was aware of the importance of\\n', 'intercolonial cooperation. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the\\n', 'Old Dominion began treaties of commerce and amity with New York and the\\n', 'colonies of New England. In 1684 delegates from Virginia met at Albany\\n', 'with the agents of New York and Massachusetts to discuss problems of\\n', 'with the Carolinas in defending their borders against Indian forays.\\n', '\\n', '=The Albany Plan of Union.=--An attempt at a general colonial union was\\n', 'made in 1754. On the suggestion of the Lords of Trade in England, a\\n', 'conference was held at Albany to consider Indian relations, to devise\\n', 'measures of defense against the French, and to enter into \"articles of\\n', \"union and confederation for the general defense of his Majesty's\\n\", 'subjects and interests in North America as well in time of peace as of\\n', 'war.\" New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York,\\n', 'Pennsylvania, and Maryland were represented. After a long discussion, a\\n', 'plan of union, drafted mainly, it seems, by Benjamin Franklin, was\\n', 'adopted and sent to the colonies and the crown for approval. The\\n', 'colonies, jealous of their individual rights, refused to accept the\\n', 'scheme and the king disapproved it for the reason, Franklin said, that\\n', 'it had \"too much weight in the democratic part of the constitution.\"\\n', 'Though the Albany union failed, the document is still worthy of study\\n', 'because it forecast many of the perplexing problems that were not solved\\n', 'until thirty-three years afterward, when another convention of which\\n', 'also Franklin was a member drafted the Constitution of the United\\n', 'States.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Military Education of the Colonists.=--The same wars that showed\\n', 'the provincials the meaning of union likewise instructed them in the art\\n', 'of defending their institutions. Particularly was this true of the last\\n', 'French and Indian conflict, which stretched all the way from Maine to\\n', 'the Carolinas and made heavy calls upon them all for troops. The answer,\\n', 'it is admitted, was far from satisfactory to the British government and\\n', 'the conduct of the militiamen was far from professional; but thousands\\n', 'of Americans got a taste, a strong taste, of actual fighting in the\\n', 'field. Men like George Washington and Daniel Morgan learned lessons that\\n', 'were not forgotten in after years. They saw what American militiamen\\n', 'could do under favorable circumstances and they watched British regulars\\n', 'operating on American soil. \"This whole transaction,\" shrewdly remarked\\n', 'Franklin of Braddock\\'s campaign, \"gave us Americans the first suspicion\\n', 'that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regular troops had not\\n', 'been well founded.\" It was no mere accident that the Virginia colonel\\n', 'who drew his sword under the elm at Cambridge and took command of the\\n', 'army of the Revolution was the brave officer who had \"spurned the\\n', 'whistle of bullets\" at the memorable battle in western Pennsylvania.\\n', '\\n', '=Financial Burdens and Commercial Disorder.=--While the provincials were\\n', 'learning lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills. All the\\n', \"conflicts were costly in treasure as in blood. King Philip's war left\\n\", 'New England weak and almost bankrupt. The French and Indian struggle was\\n', 'especially expensive. The twenty-five thousand men put in the field by\\n', 'the colonies were sustained only by huge outlays of money. Paper\\n', 'currency streamed from the press and debts were accumulated. Commerce\\n', 'was driven from its usual channels and prices were enhanced. When the\\n', 'end came, both England and America were staggering under heavy\\n', 'liabilities, and to make matters worse there was a fall of prices\\n', 'accompanied by a commercial depression which extended over a period of\\n', 'ten years. It was in the midst of this crisis that measures of taxation\\n', 'had to be devised to pay the cost of the war, precipitating the quarrel\\n', 'which led to American independence.\\n', '\\n', '=The Expulsion of French Power from North America.=--The effects of the\\n', 'defeat administered to France, as time proved, were difficult to\\n', 'estimate. Some British statesmen regarded it as a happy circumstance\\n', 'that the colonists, already restive under their administration, had no\\n', 'foreign power at hand to aid them in case they struck for independence.\\n', 'American leaders, on the other hand, now that the soldiers of King Louis\\n', 'were driven from the continent, thought that they had no other country\\n', 'to fear if they cast off British sovereignty. At all events, France,\\n', 'though defeated, was not out of the sphere of American influence; for,\\n', 'as events proved, it was the fortunate French alliance negotiated by\\n', 'Franklin that assured the triumph of American arms in the War of the\\n', 'Revolution.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'It was neither the Indian wars nor the French wars that finally brought\\n', 'forth American nationality. That was the product of the long strife\\n', 'with the mother country which culminated in union for the war of\\n', 'independence. The forces that created this nation did not operate in the\\n', 'colonies alone. The character of the English sovereigns, the course of\\n', 'events in English domestic politics, and English measures of control\\n', 'over the colonies--executive, legislative, and judicial--must all be\\n', 'taken into account.\\n', '\\n', 'and the parliamentary party and the turmoil of the Puritan regime\\n', '(1649-60) so engrossed the attention of Englishmen at home that they had\\n', 'little time to think of colonial policies or to interfere with colonial\\n', 'affairs. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660, accompanied by\\n', 'internal peace and the increasing power of the mercantile classes in the\\n', '(1660-85), himself an easy-going person, the policy of regulating trade\\n', 'by act of Parliament was developed into a closely knit system and\\n', 'powerful agencies to supervise the colonies were created. At the same\\n', 'time a system of stricter control over the dominions was ushered in by\\n', 'the annulment of the old charter of Massachusetts which conferred so\\n', 'much self-government on the Puritans.\\n', '\\n', 'authority in the colonies as well as at home, continued the policy thus\\n', 'inaugurated and enlarged upon it. If he could have kept his throne, he\\n', 'would have bent the Americans under a harsh rule or brought on in his\\n', 'dominions a revolution like that which he precipitated at home in 1688.\\n', 'He determined to unite the Northern colonies and introduce a more\\n', 'efficient administration based on the pattern of the royal provinces. He\\n', 'made a martinet, Sir Edmund Andros, governor of all New England, New\\n', 'York, and New Jersey. The charter of Massachusetts, annulled in the last\\n', \"days of his brother's reign, he continued to ignore, and that of\\n\", 'Connecticut would have been seized if it had not been spirited away and\\n', 'hidden, according to tradition, in a hollow oak.\\n', '\\n', 'For several months, Andros gave the Northern colonies a taste of\\n', 'ill-tempered despotism. He wrung quit rents from land owners not\\n', 'accustomed to feudal dues; he abrogated titles to land where, in his\\n', 'opinion, they were unlawful; he forced the Episcopal service upon the\\n', 'Old South Church in Boston; and he denied the writ of _habeas corpus_ to\\n', 'a preacher who denounced taxation without representation. In the middle\\n', 'of his arbitrary course, however, his hand was stayed. The news came\\n', 'that King James had been dethroned by his angry subjects, and the people\\n', 'of Boston, kindling a fire on Beacon Hill, summoned the countryside to\\n', 'dispose of Andros. The response was prompt and hearty. The hated\\n', 'governor was arrested, imprisoned, and sent back across the sea under\\n', 'guard.\\n', '\\n', 'The overthrow of James, followed by the accession of William and Mary\\n', 'and by assured parliamentary supremacy, had an immediate effect in the\\n', 'colonies. The new order was greeted with thanksgiving. Massachusetts was\\n', 'given another charter which, though not so liberal as the first,\\n', 'restored the spirit if not the entire letter of self-government. In the\\n', 'other colonies where Andros had been operating, the old course of\\n', 'affairs was resumed.\\n', '\\n', '=The Indifference of the First Two Georges.=--On the death in 1714 of\\n', 'Queen Anne, the successor of King William, the throne passed to a\\n', 'Hanoverian prince who, though grateful for English honors and revenues,\\n', 'whose combined reigns extended from 1714 to 1760, never even learned to\\n', 'speak the English language, at least without an accent. The necessity of\\n', 'taking thought about colonial affairs bored both of them so that the\\n', 'stoutest defender of popular privileges in Boston or Charleston had no\\n', 'ground to complain of the exercise of personal prerogatives by the king.\\n', 'Moreover, during a large part of this period, the direction of affairs\\n', 'was in the hands of an astute leader, Sir Robert Walpole, who betrayed\\n', 'his somewhat cynical view of politics by adopting as his motto: \"Let\\n', 'sleeping dogs lie.\" He revealed his appreciation of popular sentiment\\n', 'expense of blood.\" Such kings and such ministers were not likely to\\n', 'arouse the slumbering resistance of the thirteen colonies across the\\n', 'sea.\\n', '\\n', '=Control of the Crown over the Colonies.=--While no English ruler from\\n', 'personally, constant control over the colonies was exercised by royal\\n', 'officers acting under the authority of the crown. Systematic supervision\\n', 'began in 1660, when there was created by royal order a committee of the\\n', \"king's council to meet on Mondays and Thursdays of each week to consider\\n\", 'petitions, memorials, and addresses respecting the plantations. In 1696\\n', 'a regular board was established, known as the \"Lords of Trade and\\n', 'Plantations,\" which continued, until the American Revolution, to\\n', 'scrutinize closely colonial business. The chief duties of the board were\\n', 'to examine acts of colonial legislatures, to recommend measures to those\\n', 'assemblies for adoption, and to hear memorials and petitions from the\\n', 'colonies relative to their affairs.\\n', '\\n', 'The methods employed by this board were varied. All laws passed by\\n', 'American legislatures came before it for review as a matter of routine.\\n', 'If it found an act unsatisfactory, it recommended to the king the\\n', 'exercise of his veto power, known as the royal disallowance. Any person\\n', 'who believed his personal or property rights injured by a colonial law\\n', 'could be heard by the board in person or by attorney; in such cases it\\n', 'was the practice to hear at the same time the agent of the colony so\\n', 'involved. The royal veto power over colonial legislation was not,\\n', 'therefore, a formal affair, but was constantly employed on the\\n', 'suggestion of a highly efficient agency of the crown. All this was in\\n', 'addition to the powers exercised by the governors in the royal\\n', 'provinces.\\n', '\\n', '=Judicial Control.=--Supplementing this administrative control over the\\n', 'colonies was a constant supervision by the English courts of law. The\\n', 'king, by virtue of his inherent authority, claimed and exercised high\\n', 'appellate powers over all judicial tribunals in the empire. The right\\n', 'of appeal from local courts, expressly set forth in some charters, was,\\n', 'on the eve of the Revolution, maintained in every colony. Any subject in\\n', 'England or America, who, in the regular legal course, was aggrieved by\\n', 'any act of a colonial legislature or any decision of a colonial court,\\n', 'had the right, subject to certain regulations, to carry his case to the\\n', 'king in council, forcing his opponent to follow him across the sea. In\\n', 'the exercise of appellate power, the king in council acting as a court\\n', 'could, and frequently did, declare acts of colonial legislatures duly\\n', 'enacted and approved, null and void, on the ground that they were\\n', 'contrary to English law.\\n', '\\n', '=Imperial Control in Operation.=--Day after day, week after week, year\\n', 'after year, the machinery for political and judicial control over\\n', 'colonial affairs was in operation. At one time the British governors in\\n', 'the colonies were ordered not to approve any colonial law imposing a\\n', 'duty on European goods imported in English vessels. Again, when North\\n', 'Carolina laid a tax on peddlers, the council objected to it as\\n', '\"restrictive upon the trade and dispersion of English manufactures\\n', 'throughout the continent.\" At other times, Indian trade was regulated in\\n', 'the interests of the whole empire or grants of lands by a colonial\\n', 'legislature were set aside. Virginia was forbidden to close her ports to\\n', 'North Carolina lest there should be retaliation.\\n', '\\n', 'In short, foreign and intercolonial trade were subjected to a control\\n', 'higher than that of the colony, foreshadowing a day when the\\n', 'Constitution of the United States was to commit to Congress the power to\\n', 'regulate interstate and foreign commerce and commerce with the Indians.\\n', 'Supreme Court at Washington now towers above the states, kept the\\n', 'colonial legislatures within the metes and bounds of established law. In\\n', 'the thousands of appeals, memorials, petitions, and complaints, and the\\n', 'rulings and decisions upon them, were written the real history of\\n', 'British imperial control over the American colonies.\\n', '\\n', 'So great was the business before the Lords of Trade that the colonies\\n', 'had to keep skilled agents in London to protect their interests. As\\n', 'common grievances against the operation of this machinery of control\\n', 'arose, there appeared in each colony a considerable body of men, with\\n', 'the merchants in the lead, who chafed at the restraints imposed on their\\n', 'enterprise. Only a powerful blow was needed to weld these bodies into a\\n', 'common mass nourishing the spirit of colonial nationalism. When to the\\n', 'repeated minor irritations were added general and sweeping measures of\\n', 'Parliament applying to every colony, the rebound came in the Revolution.\\n', '\\n', '=Parliamentary Control over Colonial Affairs.=--As soon as Parliament\\n', 'gained in power at the expense of the king, it reached out to bring the\\n', 'American colonies under its sway as well. Between the execution of\\n', 'body of legislation regulating the shipping, trade, and manufactures of\\n', 'America. All of it, based on the \"mercantile\" theory then prevalent in\\n', 'all countries of Europe, was designed to control the overseas\\n', 'plantations in such a way as to foster the commercial and business\\n', 'interests of the mother country, where merchants and men of finance had\\n', 'got the upper hand. According to this theory, the colonies of the\\n', 'British empire should be confined to agriculture and the production of\\n', 'raw materials, and forced to buy their manufactured goods of England.\\n', '\\n', 'British colonial policy must be placed the navigation laws framed for\\n', 'the purpose of building up the British merchant marine and navy--arms so\\n', 'essential in defending the colonies against the Spanish, Dutch, and\\n', 'French. The beginning of this type of legislation was made in 1651 and\\n', '(1660-85).\\n', '\\n', 'The Navigation Acts, in effect, gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to\\n', 'British ships. No trade could be carried on between Great Britain and\\n', 'her dominions save in vessels built and manned by British subjects. No\\n', 'European goods could be brought to America save in the ships of the\\n', 'country that produced them or in English ships. These laws, which were\\n', 'almost fatal to Dutch shipping in America, fell with severity upon the\\n', 'colonists, compelling them to pay higher freight rates. The adverse\\n', 'effect, however, was short-lived, for the measures stimulated\\n', 'shipbuilding in the colonies, where the abundance of raw materials gave\\n', 'the master builders of America an advantage over those of the mother\\n', 'country. Thus the colonists in the end profited from the restrictive\\n', 'policy written into the Navigation Acts.\\n', '\\n', 'deliberately aimed to prevent colonial industries from competing too\\n', 'sharply with those of England. Among the earliest of these measures may\\n', 'be counted the Woolen Act of 1699, forbidding the exportation of woolen\\n', 'goods from the colonies and even the woolen trade between towns and\\n', 'colonies. When Parliament learned, as the result of an inquiry, that New\\n', 'England and New York were making thousands of hats a year and sending\\n', 'large numbers annually to the Southern colonies and to Ireland, Spain,\\n', 'and Portugal, it enacted in 1732 a law declaring that \"no hats or felts,\\n', 'dyed or undyed, finished or unfinished\" should be \"put upon any vessel\\n', 'or laden upon any horse or cart with intent to export to any place\\n', 'whatever.\" The effect of this measure upon the hat industry was almost\\n', 'industry. By an act of 1750, pig and bar iron from the colonies were\\n', 'given free entry to England to encourage the production of the raw\\n', 'material; but at the same time the law provided that \"no mill or other\\n', 'engine for slitting or rolling of iron, no plating forge to work with a\\n', 'tilt hammer, and no furnace for making steel\" should be built in the\\n', 'colonies. As for those already built, they were declared public\\n', 'nuisances and ordered closed. Thus three important economic interests of\\n', 'the colonists, the woolen, hat, and iron industries, were laid under the\\n', 'ban.\\n', '\\n', 'British Parliament related to the sale of colonial produce. An act of\\n', '1663 required the colonies to export certain articles to Great Britain\\n', 'or to her dominions alone; while sugar, tobacco, and ginger consigned to\\n', 'the continent of Europe had to pass through a British port paying custom\\n', \"duties and through a British merchant's hands paying the usual\\n\", 'commission. At first tobacco was the only one of the \"enumerated\\n', 'articles\" which seriously concerned the American colonies, the rest\\n', 'coming mainly from the British West Indies. In the course of time,\\n', 'however, other commodities were added to the list of enumerated\\n', 'articles, until by 1764 it embraced rice, naval stores, copper, furs,\\n', 'hides, iron, lumber, and pearl ashes. This was not all. The colonies\\n', 'were compelled to bring their European purchases back through English\\n', 'ports, paying duties to the government and commissions to merchants\\n', 'again.\\n', '\\n', 'English merchants and manufacturers, Parliament sought to protect the\\n', 'British West Indies against competition from their French and Dutch\\n', 'neighbors. New England merchants had long carried on a lucrative trade\\n', 'with the French islands in the West Indies and Dutch Guiana, where sugar\\n', 'and molasses could be obtained in large quantities at low prices. Acting\\n', 'on the protests of English planters in the Barbadoes and Jamaica,\\n', 'Parliament, in 1733, passed the famous Molasses Act imposing duties on\\n', 'sugar and molasses imported into the colonies from foreign\\n', 'countries--rates which would have destroyed the American trade with the\\n', 'French and Dutch if the law had been enforced. The duties, however, were\\n', 'not collected. The molasses and sugar trade with the foreigners went on\\n', 'merrily, smuggling taking the place of lawful traffic.\\n', '\\n', '=Effect of the Laws in America.=--As compared with the strict monopoly\\n', 'of her colonial trade which Spain consistently sought to maintain, the\\n', 'policy of England was both moderate and liberal. Furthermore, the\\n', 'restrictive laws were supplemented by many measures intended to be\\n', 'favorable to colonial prosperity. The Navigation Acts, for example,\\n', 'redounded to the advantage of American shipbuilders and the producers\\n', 'of hemp, tar, lumber, and ship stores in general. Favors in British\\n', 'ports were granted to colonial producers as against foreign competitors\\n', 'and in some instances bounties were paid by England to encourage\\n', 'colonial enterprise. Taken all in all, there is much justification in\\n', 'the argument advanced by some modern scholars to the effect that the\\n', 'colonists gained more than they lost by British trade and industrial\\n', 'legislation. Certainly after the establishment of independence, when\\n', 'free from these old restrictions, the Americans found themselves\\n', 'handicapped by being treated as foreigners rather than favored traders\\n', 'and the recipients of bounties in English markets.\\n', '\\n', 'Be that as it may, it appears that the colonists felt little irritation\\n', 'against the mother country on account of the trade and navigation laws\\n', 'enacted previous to the close of the French and Indian war. Relatively\\n', 'few were engaged in the hat and iron industries as compared with those\\n', \"in farming and planting, so that England's policy of restricting America\\n\", 'to agriculture did not conflict with the interests of the majority of\\n', 'the inhabitants. The woolen industry was largely in the hands of women\\n', 'and carried on in connection with their domestic duties, so that it was\\n', 'not the sole support of any considerable number of people.\\n', '\\n', 'As a matter of fact, moreover, the restrictive laws, especially those\\n', 'relating to trade, were not rigidly enforced. Cargoes of tobacco were\\n', 'boldly sent to continental ports without even so much as a bow to the\\n', 'English government, to which duties should have been paid. Sugar and\\n', 'molasses from the French and Dutch colonies were shipped into New\\n', 'England in spite of the law. Royal officers sometimes protested against\\n', 'smuggling and sometimes connived at it; but at no time did they succeed\\n', 'in stopping it. Taken all in all, very little was heard of \"the galling\\n', 'restraints of trade\" until after the French war, when the British\\n', 'government suddenly entered upon a new course.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'In the period between the landing of the English at Jamestown, Virginia,\\n', 'in 1607, and the close of the French and Indian war in 1763--a period of\\n', 'a century and a half--a new nation was being prepared on this continent\\n', 'to take its place among the powers of the earth. It was an epoch of\\n', 'migration. Western Europe contributed emigrants of many races and\\n', 'nationalities. The English led the way. Next to them in numerical\\n', 'importance were the Scotch-Irish and the Germans. Into the melting pot\\n', 'were also cast Dutch, Swedes, French, Jews, Welsh, and Irish. Thousands\\n', 'of negroes were brought from Africa to till Southern fields or labor as\\n', 'domestic servants in the North.\\n', '\\n', 'Why did they come? The reasons are various. Some of them, the Pilgrims\\n', 'and Puritans of New England, the French Huguenots, Scotch-Irish and\\n', 'Irish, and the Catholics of Maryland, fled from intolerant governments\\n', 'that denied them the right to worship God according to the dictates of\\n', 'their consciences. Thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in\\n', 'the Old World and to find free homes in America. Thousands, like the\\n', 'negroes from Africa, were dragged here against their will. The lure of\\n', 'adventure appealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the\\n', 'enterprising merchants.\\n', '\\n', 'How did they come? In some cases religious brotherhoods banded together\\n', 'and borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way. In other\\n', 'cases great trading companies were organized to found colonies. Again it\\n', 'was the wealthy proprietor, like Lord Baltimore or William Penn, who\\n', 'undertook to plant settlements. Many immigrants were able to pay their\\n', 'own way across the sea. Others bound themselves out for a term of years\\n', 'in exchange for the cost of the passage. Negroes were brought on account\\n', 'of the profits derived from their sale as slaves.\\n', '\\n', 'Whatever the motive for their coming, however, they managed to get\\n', 'across the sea. The immigrants set to work with a will. They cut down\\n', 'forests, built houses, and laid out fields. They founded churches,\\n', 'schools, and colleges. They set up forges and workshops. They spun and\\n', 'wove. They fashioned ships and sailed the seas. They bartered and\\n', 'traded. Here and there on favorable harbors they established centers of\\n', 'commerce--Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and\\n', 'Charleston. As soon as a firm foothold was secured on the shore line\\n', 'they pressed westward until, by the close of the colonial period, they\\n', 'were already on the crest of the Alleghanies.\\n', '\\n', 'Though they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast,\\n', 'the colonists were united in spirit by many common ties. The major\\n', 'portion of them were Protestants. The language, the law, and the\\n', 'literature of England furnished the basis of national unity. Most of the\\n', 'colonists were engaged in the same hard task; that of conquering a\\n', 'wilderness. To ties of kinship and language were added ties created by\\n', 'necessity. They had to unite in defense; first, against the Indians and\\n', 'later against the French. They were all subjects of the same\\n', 'sovereign--the king of England. The English Parliament made laws for\\n', 'them and the English government supervised their local affairs, their\\n', 'trade, and their manufactures. Common forces assailed them. Common\\n', 'grievances vexed them. Common hopes inspired them.\\n', '\\n', 'Many of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw\\n', 'them into opposition to the British Crown and Parliament. Most of them\\n', 'were freeholders; that is, farmers who owned their own land and tilled\\n', 'The majority of them were Dissenters, critics, not friends, of the\\n', 'Church of England, that stanch defender of the British monarchy. Each\\n', 'colony in time developed its own legislature elected by the voters; it\\n', 'grew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself. Here was a\\n', 'people learning self-reliance and self-government. The attempts to\\n', 'strengthen the Church of England in America and the transformation of\\n', 'colonies into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence\\n', 'which they were designed to quench.\\n', '\\n', 'Nevertheless, the Americans owed much of their prosperity to the\\n', 'assistance of the government that irritated them. It was the protection\\n', 'of the British navy that prevented Holland, Spain, and France from\\n', 'wiping out their settlements. Though their manufacture and trade were\\n', 'controlled in the interests of the mother country, they also enjoyed\\n', 'great advantages in her markets. Free trade existed nowhere upon the\\n', 'earth; but the broad empire of Britain was open to American ships and\\n', 'merchandise. It could be said, with good reason, that the disadvantages\\n', 'which the colonists suffered through British regulation of their\\n', 'industry and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed.\\n', 'Still that is somewhat beside the point, for mere economic advantage is\\n', 'thousand circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation,\\n', 'to inspire it with a passion for independence, and to prepare it for a\\n', 'destiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the British\\n', 'empire. The economists, who tried to prove by logic unassailable that\\n', 'America would be richer under the British flag, could not change the\\n', 'spirit of Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, or George\\n', 'Washington.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', 'System_.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Questions=\\n', '\\n', '1.

All his tastes and habits, good and bad, were English. No\\n', 'portion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with.... His age,\\n', 'his appearance, and all that was known of his character conciliated\\n', 'public favor. He was in the bloom of youth; his person and address were\\n', 'pleasing; scandal imputed to him no vice; and flattery might without\\n', 'glaring absurdity ascribe to him many princely virtues.\"\\n', '\\n', 'his courtiers. Under their influence he developed high and mighty\\n', 'notions about the sacredness of royal authority and his duty to check\\n', 'the pretensions of Parliament and the ministers dependent upon it. His\\n', 'mother had dinned into his ears the slogan: \"George, be king!\" Lord\\n', 'Bute, his teacher and adviser, had told him that his honor required him\\n', 'to take an active part in the shaping of public policy and the making of\\n', 'laws. Thus educated, he surrounded himself with courtiers who encouraged\\n', 'him in the determination to rule as well as reign, to subdue all\\n', 'parties, and to place himself at the head of the nation and empire.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'favored the plans of the king to restore some of the ancient luster of\\n', 'the crown. The Whigs, who were composed mainly of the smaller\\n', 'freeholders, merchants, inhabitants of towns, and Protestant\\n', 'non-conformists, had grown haughty and overbearing through long\\n', 'continuance in power and had as a consequence raised up many enemies in\\n', 'their own ranks. Their opponents, the Tories, had by this time given up\\n', 'all hope of restoring to the throne the direct Stuart line; but they\\n', 'still cherished their old notions about divine right.

In the first\\n', 'place, the House of Lords was composed mainly of hereditary nobles whose\\n', 'number the king could increase by the appointment of his favorites, as\\n', 'of old. Though the members of the House of Commons were elected by\\n', 'popular vote, they did not speak for the mass of English people. Great\\n', 'towns like Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, for example, had no\\n', 'representatives at all. While there were about eight million inhabitants\\n', 'in Great Britain, there were in 1768 only about 160,000 voters; that is\\n', 'to say, only about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the\\n', 'government. Many boroughs returned one or more members to the Commons\\n', 'although they had merely a handful of voters or in some instances no\\n', 'voters at all. Furthermore, these tiny boroughs were often controlled by\\n', 'lords who openly sold the right of representation to the highest bidder.\\n', 'The \"rotten-boroughs,\" as they were called by reformers, were a public\\n', 'the House of Commons.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Grenville and the War Debt.=--Within a year after the accession of\\n', 'with \"gross incivility\" and the crowds shouting \"Pitt forever!\" The\\n', \"direction of affairs was entrusted to men enjoying the king's\\n\", 'confidence. Leadership in the House of Commons fell to George Grenville,\\n', 'a grave and laborious man who for years had groaned over the increasing\\n', 'cost of government.\\n', '\\n', 'The first task after the conclusion of peace in 1763 was the adjustment\\n', 'of the disordered finances of the kingdom. The debt stood at the highest\\n', 'point in the history of the country. More revenue was absolutely\\n', 'necessary and Grenville began to search for it, turning his attention\\n', 'finally to the American colonies. In this quest he had the aid of a\\n', 'zealous colleague, Charles Townshend, who had long been in public\\n', 'service and was familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal\\n', 'governors in America. These two men, with the support of the entire\\n', 'ministry, inaugurated in February, 1763, \"a new system of colonial\\n', 'government. It was announced by authority that there were to be no more\\n', 'requisitions from the king to the colonial assemblies for supplies, but\\n', 'that the colonies were to be taxed instead by act of Parliament.\\n', 'Colonial governors and judges were to be paid by the Crown; they were to\\n', 'be supported by a standing army of twenty regiments; and all the\\n', 'expenses of this force were to be met by parliamentary taxation.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Restriction of Paper Money (1763).=--Among the many complaints filed\\n', 'before the board of trade were vigorous protests against the issuance of\\n', 'paper money by the colonial legislatures. The new ministry provided a\\n', 'remedy in the act of 1763, which declared void all colonial laws\\n', 'authorizing paper money or extending the life of outstanding bills. This\\n', 'law was aimed at the \"cheap money\" which the Americans were fond of\\n', 'making when specie was scarce--money which they tried to force on their\\n', 'English creditors in return for goods and in payment of the interest and\\n', 'principal of debts. Thus the first chapter was written in the long\\n', 'battle over sound money on this continent.\\n', '\\n', '=Limitation on Western Land Sales.=--Later in the same year (1763)\\n', 'for the government of the territory recently acquired by the treaty of\\n', 'Paris from the French. One of the provisions in this royal decree\\n', \"touched frontiersmen to the quick. The contests between the king's\\n\", 'officers and the colonists over the disposition of western lands had\\n', 'been long and sharp. The Americans chafed at restrictions on\\n', 'settlement. The more adventurous were continually moving west and\\n', '\"squatting\" on land purchased from the Indians or simply seized without\\n', 'authority. To put an end to this, the king forbade all further purchases\\n', 'from the Indians, reserving to the crown the right to acquire such lands\\n', 'proclamation vested the power of licensing trade with the Indians,\\n', 'including the lucrative fur business, in the hands of royal officers in\\n', 'the colonies. These two limitations on American freedom and enterprise\\n', 'were declared to be in the interest of the crown and for the\\n', 'preservation of the rights of the Indians against fraud and abuses.\\n', '\\n', \"=The Sugar Act of 1764.=--King George's ministers next turned their\\n\", 'attention to measures of taxation and trade. Since the heavy debt under\\n', 'which England was laboring had been largely incurred in the defense of\\n', 'America, nothing seemed more reasonable to them than the proposition\\n', 'that the colonies should help to bear the burden which fell so heavily\\n', 'upon the English taxpayer. The Sugar Act of 1764 was the result of this\\n', 'reasoning. There was no doubt about the purpose of this law, for it was\\n', 'set forth clearly in the title: \"An act for granting certain duties in\\n', 'the British colonies and plantations in America ... for applying the\\n', 'produce of such duties ... towards defraying the expenses of defending,\\n', 'protecting and securing the said colonies and plantations ... and for\\n', 'more effectually preventing the clandestine conveyance of goods to and\\n', 'from the said colonies and plantations and improving and securing the\\n', 'trade between the same and Great Britain.\" The old Molasses Act had been\\n', 'prohibitive; the Sugar Act of 1764 was clearly intended as a revenue\\n', 'measure. Specified duties were laid upon sugar, indigo, calico, silks,\\n', 'and many other commodities imported into the colonies. The enforcement\\n', 'of the Molasses Act had been utterly neglected; but this Sugar Act had\\n', '\"teeth in it.\" Special precautions as to bonds, security, and\\n', 'registration of ship masters, accompanied by heavy penalties, promised\\n', 'a vigorous execution of the new revenue law.\\n', '\\n', 'The strict terms of the Sugar Act were strengthened by administrative\\n', 'measures. Under a law of the previous year the commanders of armed\\n', 'vessels stationed along the American coast were authorized to stop,\\n', 'search, and, on suspicion, seize merchant ships approaching colonial\\n', 'ports. By supplementary orders, the entire British official force in\\n', 'America was instructed to be diligent in the execution of all trade and\\n', 'navigation laws. Revenue collectors, officers of the army and navy, and\\n', 'royal governors were curtly ordered to the front to do their full duty\\n', 'in the matter of law enforcement. The ordinary motives for the discharge\\n', 'of official obligations were sharpened by an appeal to avarice, for\\n', 'naval officers who seized offenders against the law were rewarded by\\n', 'large prizes out of the forfeitures and penalties.\\n', '\\n', '=The Stamp Act (1765).=--The Grenville-Townshend combination moved\\n', 'steadily towards its goal. While the Sugar Act was under consideration\\n', 'in Parliament, Grenville announced a plan for a stamp bill. The next\\n', 'year it went through both Houses with a speed that must have astounded\\n', 'its authors. The vote in the Commons stood 205 in favor to 49 against;\\n', 'while in the Lords it was not even necessary to go through the formality\\n', 'royal assent by a commission acting as a board of regency. Protests of\\n', 'colonial agents in London were futile. \"We might as well have hindered\\n', 'the sun\\'s progress!\" exclaimed Franklin. Protests of a few opponents in\\n', 'the Commons were equally vain. The ministry was firm in its course and\\n', 'from all appearances the Stamp Act hardly roused as much as a languid\\n', 'interest in the city of London. In fact, it is recorded that the fateful\\n', 'measure attracted less notice than a bill providing for a commission to\\n', 'act for the king when he was incapacitated.\\n', '\\n', 'The Stamp Act, like the Sugar Act, declared the purpose of the British\\n', 'government to raise revenue in America \"towards defraying the expenses\\n', 'of defending, protecting, and securing the British colonies and\\n', 'plantations in America.\" It was a long measure of more than fifty\\n', 'sections, carefully planned and skillfully drawn. By its provisions\\n', 'duties were imposed on practically all papers used in legal\\n', 'transactions,--deeds, mortgages, inventories, writs, bail bonds,--on\\n', 'licenses to practice law and sell liquor, on college diplomas, playing\\n', 'cards, dice, pamphlets, newspapers, almanacs, calendars, and\\n', 'advertisements. The drag net was closely knit, for scarcely anything\\n', 'escaped.\\n', '\\n', '=The Quartering Act (1765).=--The ministers were aware that the Stamp\\n', 'Act would rouse opposition in America--how great they could not\\n', 'conjecture. While the measure was being debated, a friend of General\\n', 'Wolfe, Colonel Barre, who knew America well, gave them an ominous\\n', 'he exclaimed, \"the same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at\\n', 'first will accompany them still ... a people jealous of their liberties\\n', 'and who will vindicate them, if ever they should be violated.\" The\\n', 'answer of the ministry to a prophecy of force was a threat of force.\\n', 'Preparations were accordingly made to dispatch a larger number of\\n', 'soldiers than usual to the colonies, and the ink was hardly dry on the\\n', 'Stamp Act when Parliament passed the Quartering Act ordering the\\n', 'colonists to provide accommodations for the soldiers who were to enforce\\n', 'the new laws. \"We have the power to tax them,\" said one of the ministry,\\n', '\"and we will tax them.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Popular Opposition.=--The Stamp Act was greeted in America by an\\n', 'outburst of denunciation. The merchants of the seaboard cities took the\\n', 'lead in making a dignified but unmistakable protest, agreeing not to\\n', 'import British goods while the hated law stood upon the books. Lawyers,\\n', 'some of them incensed at the heavy taxes on their operations and others\\n', 'intimidated by patriots who refused to permit them to use stamped\\n', 'papers, joined with the merchants. Aristocratic colonial Whigs, who had\\n', 'long grumbled at the administration of royal governors, protested\\n', 'against taxation without their consent, as the Whigs had done in old\\n', 'England. There were Tories, however, in the colonies as in England--many\\n', 'of them of the official class--who denounced the merchants, lawyers, and\\n', 'Whig aristocrats as \"seditious, factious and republican.\" Yet the\\n', 'opposition to the Stamp Act and its accompanying measure, the Quartering\\n', 'Act, grew steadily all through the summer of 1765.\\n', '\\n', 'In a little while it was taken up in the streets and along the\\n', 'countryside. All through the North and in some of the Southern colonies,\\n', 'there sprang up, as if by magic, committees and societies pledged to\\n', 'resist the Stamp Act to the bitter end. These popular societies were\\n', 'known as Sons of Liberty and Daughters of Liberty: the former including\\n', 'artisans, mechanics, and laborers; and the latter, patriotic women. Both\\n', 'groups were alike in that they had as yet taken little part in public\\n', 'affairs. Many artisans, as well as all the women, were excluded from the\\n', 'right to vote for colonial assemblymen.\\n', '\\n', 'While the merchants and Whig gentlemen confined their efforts chiefly to\\n', 'drafting well-phrased protests against British measures, the Sons of\\n', 'Liberty operated in the streets and chose rougher measures. They stirred\\n', 'up riots in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston when attempts\\n', 'were made to sell the stamps. They sacked and burned the residences of\\n', 'high royal officers. They organized committees of inquisition who by\\n', 'threats and intimidation curtailed the sale of British goods and the use\\n', 'of stamped papers. In fact, the Sons of Liberty carried their operations\\n', 'to such excesses that many mild opponents of the stamp tax were\\n', 'frightened and drew back in astonishment at the forces they had\\n', 'unloosed. The Daughters of Liberty in a quieter way were making a very\\n', 'effective resistance to the sale of the hated goods by spurring on\\n', 'domestic industries, their own particular province being the manufacture\\n', 'of clothing, and devising substitutes for taxed foods. They helped to\\n', 'feed and clothe their families without buying British goods.\\n', '\\n', '=Legislative Action against the Stamp Act.=--Leaders in the colonial\\n', 'assemblies, accustomed to battle against British policies, supported the\\n', 'popular protest. The Stamp Act was signed on March 22, 1765. On May 30,\\n', 'the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a set of resolutions declaring\\n', 'that the General Assembly of the colony alone had the right to lay taxes\\n', 'upon the inhabitants and that attempts to impose them otherwise were\\n', '\"illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust.\" It was in support of these\\n', 'resolutions that Patrick Henry uttered the immortal challenge: \"Caesar\\n', 'profit by their example. If that be treason, make the most of it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Stamp Act Congress.=--The Massachusetts Assembly answered the call\\n', 'of Virginia by inviting the colonies to elect delegates to a Congress to\\n', 'be held in New York to discuss the situation. Nine colonies responded\\n', 'and sent representatives. The delegates, while professing the warmest\\n', \"affection for the king's person and government, firmly spread on record\\n\", 'a series of resolutions that admitted of no double meaning. They\\n', 'declared that taxes could not be imposed without their consent, given\\n', 'through their respective colonial assemblies; that the Stamp Act showed\\n', 'a tendency to subvert their rights and liberties; that the recent trade\\n', 'acts were burdensome and grievous; and that the right to petition the\\n', 'king and Parliament was their heritage. They thereupon made \"humble\\n', 'supplication\" for the repeal of the Stamp Act.\\n', '\\n', 'The Stamp Act Congress was more than an assembly of protest. It marked\\n', 'the rise of a new agency of government to express the will of America.\\n', 'It was the germ of a government which in time was to supersede the\\n', 'of the United States under the Constitution. It was a successful attempt\\n', 'at union. \"There ought to be no New England men,\" declared Christopher\\n', 'Gadsden, in the Stamp Act Congress, \"no New Yorkers known on the\\n', 'Continent, but all of us Americans.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Repeal of the Stamp Act and the Sugar Act.=--The effect of American\\n', 'resistance on opinion in England was telling. Commerce with the colonies\\n', 'had been effectively boycotted by the Americans; ships lay idly swinging\\n', 'at the wharves; bankruptcy threatened hundreds of merchants in London,\\n', 'Bristol, and Liverpool. Workingmen in the manufacturing towns of England\\n', 'were thrown out of employment. The government had sown folly and was\\n', 'reaping, in place of the coveted revenue, rebellion.\\n', '\\n', 'Perplexed by the storm they had raised, the ministers summoned to the\\n', 'bar of the House of Commons, Benjamin Franklin, the agent for\\n', 'Pennsylvania, who was in London. \"Do you think it right,\" asked\\n', 'Grenville, \"that America should be protected by this country and pay no\\n', 'part of the expenses?\" The answer was brief: \"That is not the case; the\\n', 'colonies raised, clothed, and paid during the last war twenty-five\\n', 'thousand men and spent many millions.\" Then came an inquiry whether the\\n', 'colonists would accept a modified stamp act. \"No, never,\" replied\\n', 'Franklin, \"never! They will never submit to it!\" It was next suggested\\n', 'that military force might compel obedience to law. Franklin had a ready\\n', 'answer. \"They cannot force a man to take stamps.... They may not find a\\n', 'rebellion; they may, indeed, make one.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The repeal of the Stamp Act was moved in the House of Commons a few days\\n', 'later. The sponsor for the repeal spoke of commerce interrupted, debts\\n', 'due British merchants placed in jeopardy, Manchester industries closed,\\n', 'workingmen unemployed, oppression instituted, and the loss of the\\n', 'colonies threatened. Pitt and Edmund Burke, the former near the close\\n', 'of his career, the latter just beginning his, argued cogently in favor\\n', 'of retracing the steps taken the year before. Grenville refused.\\n', '\"America must learn,\" he wailed, \"that prayers are not to be brought to\\n', 'Caesar through riot and sedition.\" His protests were idle. The Commons\\n', 'agreed to the repeal on February 22, 1766, amid the cheers of the\\n', 'victorious majority. It was carried through the Lords in the face of\\n', 'strong opposition and, on March 18, reluctantly signed by the king, now\\n', 'restored to his right mind.\\n', '\\n', 'In rescinding the Stamp Act, Parliament did not admit the contention of\\n', 'the Americans that it was without power to tax them. On the contrary, it\\n', 'accompanied the repeal with a Declaratory Act. It announced that the\\n', 'colonies were subordinate to the crown and Parliament of Great Britain;\\n', 'that the king and Parliament therefore had undoubted authority to make\\n', 'laws binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever; and that the\\n', 'resolutions and proceedings of the colonists denying such authority were\\n', 'null and void.\\n', '\\n', 'The repeal was greeted by the colonists with great popular\\n', 'demonstrations. Bells were rung; toasts to the king were drunk; and\\n', 'trade resumed its normal course. The Declaratory Act, as a mere paper\\n', 'resolution, did not disturb the good humor of those who again cheered\\n', 'the name of King George. Their confidence was soon strengthened by the\\n', 'news that even the Sugar Act had been repealed, thus practically\\n', 'restoring the condition of affairs before Grenville and Townshend\\n', 'inaugurated their policy of \"thoroughness.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Townshend Acts (1767).=--The triumph of the colonists was brief.\\n', 'Though Pitt, the friend of America, was once more prime minister, and\\n', 'seated in the House of Lords as the Earl of Chatham, his severe illness\\n', 'gave to Townshend and the Tory party practical control over Parliament.\\n', 'Unconvinced by the experience with the Stamp Act, Townshend brought\\n', 'forward and pushed through both Houses of Parliament three measures,\\n', 'which to this day are associated with his name. First among his\\n', 'restrictive laws was that of June 29, 1767, which placed the enforcement\\n', 'of the collection of duties and customs on colonial imports and exports\\n', 'in the hands of British commissioners appointed by the king, resident in\\n', 'the colonies, paid from the British treasury, and independent of all\\n', 'control by the colonists. The second measure of the same date imposed a\\n', 'tax on lead, glass, paint, tea, and a few other articles imported into\\n', 'the colonies, the revenue derived from the duties to be applied toward\\n', 'the payment of the salaries and other expenses of royal colonial\\n', 'tea trade which the Americans carried on illegally with foreigners. This\\n', 'law abolished the duty which the East India Company had to pay in\\n', 'England on tea exported to America, for it was thought that English tea\\n', 'merchants might thus find it possible to undersell American tea\\n', 'smugglers.\\n', '\\n', '=Writs of Assistance Legalized by Parliament.=--Had Parliament been\\n', 'content with laying duties, just as a manifestation of power and right,\\n', 'and neglected their collection, perhaps little would have been heard of\\n', 'the Townshend Acts. It provided, however, for the strict, even the\\n', 'harsh, enforcement of the law. It ordered customs officers to remain at\\n', 'their posts and put an end to smuggling. In the revenue act of June 29,\\n', '1767, it expressly authorized the superior courts of the colonies to\\n', 'issue \"writs of assistance,\" empowering customs officers to enter \"any\\n', 'house, warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place in the British colonies\\n', 'or plantations in America to search for and seize\" prohibited or\\n', 'smuggled goods.\\n', '\\n', 'The writ of assistance, which was a general search warrant issued to\\n', 'revenue officers, was an ancient device hateful to a people who\\n', 'cherished the spirit of personal independence and who had made actual\\n', 'gains in the practice of civil liberty. To allow a \"minion of the law\"\\n', \"to enter a man's house and search his papers and premises, was too much\\n\", 'for the emotions of people who had fled to America in a quest for\\n', 'self-government and free homes, who had braved such hardships to\\n', 'establish them, and who wanted to trade without official interference.\\n', '\\n', 'The writ of assistance had been used in Massachusetts in 1755 to prevent\\n', 'illicit trade with Canada and had aroused a violent hostility at that\\n', 'time. In 1761 it was again the subject of a bitter controversy which\\n', 'arose in connection with the application of a customs officer to a\\n', 'Massachusetts court for writs of assistance \"as usual.\" This application\\n', \"was vainly opposed by James Otis in a speech of five hours' duration--a\\n\", 'speech of such fire and eloquence that it sent every man who heard it\\n', 'away \"ready to take up arms against writs of assistance.\" Otis denounced\\n', 'the practice as an exercise of arbitrary power which had cost one king\\n', \"his head and another his throne, a tyrant's device which placed the\\n\", 'liberty of every man in jeopardy, enabling any petty officer to work\\n', 'possible malice on any innocent citizen on the merest suspicion, and to\\n', 'spread terror and desolation through the land. \"What a scene,\" he\\n', 'exclaimed, \"does this open! Every man, prompted by revenge, ill-humor,\\n', \"or wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbor's house, may get a\\n\", 'writ of assistance. Others will ask it from self-defense; one arbitrary\\n', 'exertion will provoke another until society is involved in tumult and\\n', 'blood.\" He did more than attack the writ itself. He said that Parliament\\n', 'could not establish it because it was against the British constitution.\\n', 'This was an assertion resting on slender foundation, but it was quickly\\n', 'echoed by the people. Then and there James Otis sounded the call to\\n', 'America to resist the exercise of arbitrary power by royal officers.\\n', '\"Then and there,\" wrote John Adams, \"the child Independence was born.\"\\n', 'Such was the hated writ that Townshend proposed to put into the hands of\\n', 'customs officers in his grim determination to enforce the law.\\n', '\\n', \"=The New York Assembly Suspended.=--In the very month that Townshend's\\n\", 'Acts were signed by the king, Parliament took a still more drastic step.\\n', 'The assembly of New York, protesting against the \"ruinous and\\n', 'insupportable\" expense involved, had failed to make provision for the\\n', 'care of British troops in accordance with the terms of the Quartering\\n', 'Act. Parliament therefore suspended the assembly until it promised to\\n', 'obey the law. It was not until a third election was held that compliance\\n', 'with the Quartering Act was wrung from the reluctant province. In the\\n', 'meantime, all the colonies had learned on how frail a foundation their\\n', 'representative bodies rested.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Massachusetts Circular (1768).=--Massachusetts, under the\\n', 'leadership of Samuel Adams, resolved to resist the policy of renewed\\n', 'intervention in America. At his suggestion the assembly adopted a\\n', 'Circular Letter addressed to the assemblies of the other colonies\\n', 'informing them of the state of affairs in Massachusetts and roundly\\n', 'condemning the whole British program. The Circular Letter declared that\\n', 'Parliament had no right to lay taxes on Americans without their consent\\n', 'and that the colonists could not, from the nature of the case, be\\n', 'represented in Parliament. It went on shrewdly to submit to\\n', 'consideration the question as to whether any people could be called free\\n', 'who were subjected to governors and judges appointed by the crown and\\n', 'paid out of funds raised independently. It invited the other colonies,\\n', 'in the most temperate tones, to take thought about the common\\n', 'predicament in which they were all placed.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Dissolution of Assemblies.=--The governor of Massachusetts, hearing\\n', 'of the Circular Letter, ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal. On\\n', 'meeting refusal, he promptly dissolved it. The Maryland, Georgia, and\\n', 'South Carolina assemblies indorsed the Circular Letter and were also\\n', 'dissolved at once. The Virginia House of Burgesses, thoroughly aroused,\\n', 'passed resolutions on May 16, 1769, declaring that the sole right of\\n', 'imposing taxes in Virginia was vested in its legislature, asserting anew\\n', 'the right of petition to the crown, condemning the transportation of\\n', 'persons accused of crimes or trial beyond the seas, and beseeching the\\n', 'king for a redress of the general grievances. The immediate dissolution\\n', 'of the Virginia assembly, in its turn, was the answer of the royal\\n', 'governor.\\n', '\\n', '=The Boston Massacre.=--American opposition to the British authorities\\n', 'kept steadily rising as assemblies were dissolved, the houses of\\n', 'citizens searched, and troops distributed in increasing numbers among\\n', 'the centers of discontent. Merchants again agreed not to import British\\n', 'goods, the Sons of Liberty renewed their agitation, and women set about\\n', 'the patronage of home products still more loyally.\\n', '\\n', 'On the night of March 5, 1770, a crowd on the streets of Boston began to\\n', 'jostle and tease some British regulars stationed in the town. Things\\n', 'went from bad to worse until some \"boys and young fellows\" began to\\n', 'throw snowballs and stones. Then the exasperated soldiers fired into the\\n', 'crowd, killing five and wounding half a dozen more. The day after the\\n', '\"massacre,\" a mass meeting was held in the town and Samuel Adams was\\n', 'sent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers. The governor hesitated\\n', 'and tried to compromise. Finding Adams relentless, the governor yielded\\n', 'and ordered the regulars away.\\n', '\\n', 'The Boston Massacre stirred the country from New Hampshire to Georgia.\\n', 'Popular passions ran high. The guilty soldiers were charged with murder.\\n', 'Their defense was undertaken, in spite of the wrath of the populace, by\\n', 'John Adams and Josiah Quincy, who as lawyers thought even the worst\\n', '\\n', 'offenders entitled to their full rights in law. In his speech to the\\n', 'jury, however, Adams warned the British government against its course,\\n', 'saying, that \"from the nature of things soldiers quartered in a populous\\n', 'town will always occasion two mobs where they will prevent one.\" Two of\\n', 'the soldiers were convicted and lightly punished.\\n', '\\n', '=Resistance in the South.=--The year following the Boston Massacre some\\n', 'citizens of North Carolina, goaded by the conduct of the royal governor,\\n', 'openly resisted his authority. Many were killed as a result and seven\\n', 'troops and local militia met in a pitched battle near Alamance River,\\n', 'called the \"Lexington of the South.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The _Gaspee_ Affair and the Virginia Resolutions of 1773.=--On sea as\\n', 'well as on land, friction between the royal officers and the colonists\\n', 'broke out into overt acts. While patrolling Narragansett Bay looking for\\n', 'smugglers one day in 1772, the armed ship, _Gaspee_, ran ashore and was\\n', 'caught fast. During the night several men from Providence boarded the\\n', 'sent to Rhode Island to discover the offenders and bring them to\\n', 'account, failed because it could not find a single informer. The very\\n', 'appointment of such a commission aroused the patriots of Virginia to\\n', 'action; and in March, 1773, the House of Burgesses passed a resolution\\n', 'creating a standing committee of correspondence to develop cooperation\\n', 'among the colonies in resistance to British measures.\\n', '\\n', '=The Boston Tea Party.=--Although the British government, finding the\\n', 'Townshend revenue act a failure, repealed in 1770 all the duties except\\n', 'that on tea, it in no way relaxed its resolve to enforce the other\\n', 'commercial regulations it had imposed on the colonies. Moreover,\\n', 'Parliament decided to relieve the British East India Company of the\\n', 'financial difficulties into which it had fallen partly by reason of the\\n', 'Tea Act and the colonial boycott that followed. In 1773 it agreed to\\n', 'return to the Company the regular import duties, levied in England, on\\n', 'collected in America, was left as a reminder of the principle laid down\\n', 'in the Declaratory Act that Parliament had the right to tax the\\n', 'colonists.\\n', '\\n', 'This arrangement with the East India Company was obnoxious to the\\n', 'colonists for several reasons. It was an act of favoritism for one\\n', 'thing, in the interest of a great monopoly. For another thing, it\\n', 'promised to dump on the American market, suddenly, an immense amount of\\n', 'cheap tea and so cause heavy losses to American merchants who had large\\n', 'stocks on hand. It threatened with ruin the business of all those who\\n', 'were engaged in clandestine trade with the Dutch. It carried with it an\\n', 'irritating tax of three pence on imports. In Charleston, Annapolis, New\\n', 'York, and Boston, captains of ships who brought tea under this act were\\n', 'roughly handled. One night in December, 1773, a band of Boston citizens,\\n', 'disguised as Indians, boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the cargo\\n', 'into the harbor. This was serious business, for it was open, flagrant,\\n', 'determined violation of the law. As such the British government viewed\\n', 'it.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Reception of the News of the Tea Riot.=--The news of the tea riot in\\n', 'Boston confirmed King George in his conviction that there should be no\\n', 'soft policy in dealing with his American subjects. \"The die is cast,\" he\\n', 'stated with evident satisfaction. \"The colonies must either triumph or\\n', 'submit.... If we take the resolute part, they will undoubtedly be very\\n', 'meek.\" Lord George Germain characterized the tea party as \"the\\n', 'proceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble who ought, if they had\\n', 'the least prudence, to follow their mercantile employments and not\\n', 'trouble themselves with politics and government, which they do not\\n', 'understand.\" This expressed, in concise form, exactly the sentiments of\\n', \"Lord North, who had then for three years been the king's chief minister.\\n\", 'Even Pitt, Lord Chatham, was prepared to support the government in\\n', 'upholding its authority.\\n', '\\n', '=The Five Intolerable Acts.=--Parliament, beginning on March 31, 1774,\\n', 'passed five stringent measures, known in American history as the five\\n', '\"intolerable acts.\" They were aimed at curing the unrest in America. The\\n', '_first_ of them was a bill absolutely shutting the port of Boston to\\n', 'commerce with the outside world. The _second_, following closely,\\n', 'revoked the Massachusetts charter of 1691 and provided furthermore that\\n', 'the councilors should be appointed by the king, that all judges should\\n', 'be named by the royal governor, and that town meetings (except to elect\\n', '_third_ measure, after denouncing the \"utter subversion of all lawful\\n', 'government\" in the provinces, authorized royal agents to transfer to\\n', 'Great Britain or to other colonies the trials of officers or other\\n', 'persons accused of murder in connection with the enforcement of the law.\\n', 'The _fourth_ act legalized the quartering of troops in Massachusetts\\n', 'towns. The _fifth_ of the measures was the Quebec Act, which granted\\n', 'religious toleration to the Catholics in Canada, extended the boundaries\\n', 'of Quebec southward to the Ohio River, and established, in this western\\n', 'region, government by a viceroy.\\n', '\\n', 'The intolerable acts went through Parliament with extraordinary\\n', 'celerity. There was an opposition, alert and informed; but it was\\n', 'ineffective. Burke spoke eloquently against the Boston port bill,\\n', 'condemning it roundly for punishing the innocent with the guilty, and\\n', 'showing how likely it was to bring grave consequences in its train. He\\n', 'was heard with respect and his pleas were rejected. The bill passed both\\n', 'houses without a division, the entry \"unanimous\" being made upon their\\n', 'journals although it did not accurately represent the state of opinion.\\n', 'The law destroying the charter of Massachusetts passed the Commons by a\\n', 'vote of three to one; and the third intolerable act by a vote of four to\\n', 'one. The triumph of the ministry was complete. \"What passed in Boston,\"\\n', 'exclaimed the great jurist, Lord Mansfield, \"is the overt act of High\\n', 'Treason proceeding from our over lenity and want of foresight.\" The\\n', 'crown and Parliament were united in resorting to punitive measures.\\n', '\\n', 'In the colonies the laws were received with consternation. To the\\n', 'American Protestants, the Quebec Act was the most offensive. That\\n', 'project they viewed not as an act of grace or of mercy but as a direct\\n', 'attempt to enlist French Canadians on the side of Great Britain. The\\n', 'British government did not grant religious toleration to Catholics\\n', 'either at home or in Ireland and the Americans could see no good motive\\n', 'in granting it in North America. The act was also offensive because\\n', 'Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia had, under their charters,\\n', 'large claims in the territory thus annexed to Quebec.\\n', '\\n', 'To enforce these intolerable acts the military arm of the British\\n', 'government was brought into play. The commander-in-chief of the armed\\n', 'forces in America, General Gage, was appointed governor of\\n', 'Massachusetts. Reinforcements were brought to the colonies, for now King\\n', 'George was to give \"the rebels,\" as he called them, a taste of strong\\n', 'medicine. The majesty of his law was to be vindicated by force.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Doctrine of Natural Rights.=--The dissolution of assemblies, the\\n', 'destruction of charters, and the use of troops produced in the colonies\\n', 'a new phase in the struggle. In the early days of the contest with the\\n', 'British ministry, the Americans spoke of their \"rights as Englishmen\"\\n', 'and condemned the acts of Parliament as unlawful, as violating the\\n', 'principles of the English constitution under which they all lived. When\\n', 'they saw that such arguments had no effect on Parliament, they turned\\n', 'for support to their \"natural rights.\" The latter doctrine, in the form\\n', 'in which it was employed by the colonists, was as English as the\\n', 'constitutional argument. John Locke had used it with good effect in\\n', 'defense of the English revolution in the seventeenth century. American\\n', 'leaders, familiar with the writings of Locke, also took up his thesis in\\n', 'the hour of their distress. They openly declared that their rights did\\n', 'not rest after all upon the English constitution or a charter from the\\n', 'crown. \"Old Magna Carta was not the beginning of all things,\" retorted\\n', 'Parliament shall declare every American charter void, but the natural,\\n', 'inherent, and inseparable rights of the colonists as men and as citizens\\n', 'would remain and whatever became of charters can never be abolished\\n', 'until the general conflagration.\" Of the same opinion was the young and\\n', 'impetuous Alexander Hamilton. \"The sacred rights of mankind,\" he\\n', 'exclaimed, \"are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty\\n', 'records. They are written as with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human\\n', 'destiny by the hand of divinity itself, and can never be erased or\\n', 'obscured by mortal power.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Firm as the American leaders were in the statement and defense of their\\n', 'rights, there is every reason for believing that in the beginning they\\n', 'hoped to confine the conflict to the realm of opinion. They constantly\\n', 'avowed that they were loyal to the king when protesting in the strongest\\n', 'language against his policies. Even Otis, regarded by the loyalists as a\\n', 'firebrand, was in fact attempting to avert revolution by winning\\n', 'pleasure,\" he solemnly urged in his speech against the writs of\\n', 'assistance, \"as it is in favor of British liberty ... and as it is in\\n', 'opposition to a kind of power, the exercise of which in former periods\\n', 'cost one king of England his head and another his throne.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Burke Offers the Doctrine of Conciliation.=--The flooding tide of\\n', 'American sentiment was correctly measured by one Englishman at least,\\n', 'Edmund Burke, who quickly saw that attempts to restrain the rise of\\n', 'American democracy were efforts to reverse the processes of nature. He\\n', 'saw how fixed and rooted in the nature of things was the American\\n', 'spirit--how inevitable, how irresistible. He warned his countrymen that\\n', 'there were three ways of handling the delicate situation--and only\\n', 'three. One was to remove the cause of friction by changing the spirit of\\n', 'the colonists--an utter impossibility because that spirit was grounded\\n', 'in the essential circumstances of American life. The second was to\\n', 'prosecute American leaders as criminals; of this he begged his\\n', 'countrymen to beware lest the colonists declare that \"a government\\n', 'against which a claim of liberty is tantamount to high treason is a\\n', 'government to which submission is equivalent to slavery.\" The third and\\n', 'right way to meet the problem, Burke concluded, was to accept the\\n', 'American spirit, repeal the obnoxious measures, and receive the colonies\\n', 'into equal partnership.\\n', '\\n', '=Events Produce the Great Decision.=--The right way, indicated by Burke,\\n', 'their narrow minds, American opinion was contemptible and American\\n', 'resistance unlawful, riotous, and treasonable. The correct way, in their\\n', 'view, was to dispatch more troops to crush the \"rebels\"; and that very\\n', 'act took the contest from the realm of opinion. As John Adams said:\\n', '\"Facts are stubborn things.\" Opinions were unseen, but marching soldiers\\n', 'were visible to the veriest street urchin. \"Now,\" said Gouverneur\\n', 'Morris, \"the sheep, simple as they are, cannot be gulled as heretofore.\"\\n', 'It was too late to talk about the excellence of the British\\n', 'constitution.

The\\n', 'cause of Massachusetts became the cause of all the colonies. Opposition\\n', 'to British policy, hitherto local and spasmodic, now took on a national\\n', 'character. To local committees and provincial conventions was added a\\n', 'Continental Congress, appropriately called by Massachusetts on June 17,\\n', '1774, at the instigation of Samuel Adams. The response to the summons\\n', 'was electric. By hurried and irregular methods delegates were elected\\n', 'during the summer, and on September 5 the Congress duly assembled in\\n', \"Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia. Many of the greatest men in America\\n\", 'were there--George Washington and Patrick Henry from Virginia and John\\n', 'and Samuel Adams from Massachusetts. Every shade of opinion was\\n', 'represented. Some were impatient with mild devices; the majority favored\\n', 'moderation.\\n', '\\n', 'The Congress drew up a declaration of American rights and stated in\\n', 'clear and dignified language the grievances of the colonists. It\\n', 'approved the resistance to British measures offered by Massachusetts and\\n', 'promised the united support of all sections. It prepared an address to\\n', 'King George and another to the people of England, disavowing the idea of\\n', 'independence but firmly attacking the policies pursued by the British\\n', 'government.\\n', '\\n', '=The Non-Importation Agreement.=--The Congress was not content, however,\\n', 'with professions of faith and with petitions. It took one revolutionary\\n', 'step. It agreed to stop the importation of British goods into America,\\n', 'and the enforcement of this agreement it placed in the hands of local\\n', '\"committees of safety and inspection,\" to be elected by the qualified\\n', 'voters. The significance of this action is obvious. Congress threw\\n', 'itself athwart British law. It made a rule to bind American citizens and\\n', 'to be carried into effect by American officers. It set up a state within\\n', 'the British state and laid down a test of allegiance to the new order.\\n', 'The colonists, who up to this moment had been wavering, had to choose\\n', 'one authority or the other. They were for the enforcement of the\\n', 'non-importation agreement or they were against it. They either bought\\n', 'English goods or they did not. In the spirit of the toast--\"May Britain\\n', 'be wise and America be free\"--the first Continental Congress adjourned\\n', 'in October, having appointed the tenth of May following for the meeting\\n', 'of a second Congress, should necessity require.\\n', '\\n', '=Lord North\\'s \"Olive Branch.\"=--When the news of the action of the\\n', 'American Congress reached England, Pitt and Burke warmly urged a repeal\\n', 'of the obnoxious laws, but in vain. All they could wring from the prime\\n', 'minister, Lord North, was a set of \"conciliatory resolutions\" proposing\\n', 'to relieve from taxation any colony that would assume its share of\\n', 'imperial defense and make provision for supporting the local officers of\\n', 'the crown. This \"olive branch\" was accompanied by a resolution assuring\\n', 'the king of support at all hazards in suppressing the rebellion and by\\n', 'the restraining act of March 30, 1775, which in effect destroyed the\\n', 'commerce of New England.\\n', '\\n', '=Bloodshed at Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775).=--Meanwhile the\\n', 'British authorities in Massachusetts relaxed none of their efforts in\\n', 'upholding British sovereignty. General Gage, hearing that military\\n', 'stores had been collected at Concord, dispatched a small force to seize\\n', 'them. By this act he precipitated the conflict he had sought to avoid.\\n', 'At Lexington, on the road to Concord, occurred \"the little thing\" that\\n', 'produced \"the great event.\" An unexpected collision beyond the thought\\n', 'or purpose of any man had transferred the contest from the forum to the\\n', 'battle field.\\n', '\\n', '=The Second Continental Congress.=--Though blood had been shed and war\\n', 'was actually at hand, the second Continental Congress, which met at\\n', 'Philadelphia in May, 1775, was not yet convinced that conciliation was\\n', 'beyond human power. It petitioned the king to interpose on behalf of the\\n', 'colonists in order that the empire might avoid the calamities of civil\\n', 'war. On the last day of July, it made a temperate but firm answer to\\n', \"Lord North's offer of conciliation, stating that the proposal was\\n\", 'unsatisfactory because it did not renounce the right to tax or repeal\\n', 'the offensive acts of Parliament.\\n', '\\n', '=Force, the British Answer.=--Just as the representatives of America\\n', 'were about to present the last petition of Congress to the king on\\n', 'announcement declared that the colonists, \"misled by dangerous and\\n', 'ill-designing men,\" were in a state of insurrection; it called on the\\n', 'civil and military powers to bring \"the traitors to justice\"; and it\\n', 'threatened with \"condign punishment the authors, perpetrators, and\\n', 'abettors of such traitorous designs.\" It closed with the usual prayer:\\n', '\"God, save the king.\" Later in the year, Parliament passed a sweeping\\n', 'act destroying all trade and intercourse with America. Congress was\\n', \"silent at last. Force was also America's answer.\\n\", '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Drifting into War.=--Although the Congress had not given up all hope of\\n', 'reconciliation in the spring and summer of 1775, it had firmly resolved\\n', 'to defend American rights by arms if necessary. It transformed the\\n', 'militiamen who had assembled near Boston, after the battle of Lexington,\\n', 'into a Continental army and selected Washington as commander-in-chief.\\n', 'It assumed the powers of a government and prepared to raise money, wage\\n', 'war, and carry on diplomatic relations with foreign countries.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Events followed thick and fast. On June 17, the American militia, by\\n', 'the stubborn defense of Bunker Hill, showed that it could make British\\n', 'of the army at Cambridge. In January, 1776, after bitter disappointments\\n', 'in drumming up recruits for its army in England, Scotland, and Ireland,\\n', 'the British government concluded a treaty with the Landgrave of\\n', 'Hesse-Cassel in Germany contracting, at a handsome figure, for thousands\\n', 'of soldiers and many pieces of cannon. This was the crowning insult to\\n', 'America. Such was the view of all friends of the colonies on both sides\\n', 'of the water. Such was, long afterward, the judgment of the conservative\\n', 'historian Lecky: \"The conduct of England in hiring German mercenaries to\\n', 'subdue the essentially English population beyond the Atlantic made\\n', 'reconciliation hopeless and independence inevitable.\" The news of this\\n', 'wretched transaction in German soldiers had hardly reached America\\n', 'before there ran all down the coast the thrilling story that Washington\\n', 'had taken Boston, on March 17, 1776, compelling Lord Howe to sail with\\n', 'his entire army for Halifax.\\n', '\\n', '=The Growth of Public Sentiment in Favor of Independence.=--Events were\\n', 'bearing the Americans away from their old position under the British\\n', 'constitution toward a final separation. Slowly and against their\\n', 'desires, prudent and honorable men, who cherished the ties that united\\n', 'them to the old order and dreaded with genuine horror all thought of\\n', 'revolution, were drawn into the path that led to the great decision. In\\n', 'all parts of the country and among all classes, the question of the hour\\n', 'was being debated. \"American independence,\" as the historian Bancroft\\n', 'says, \"was not an act of sudden passion nor the work of one man or one\\n', 'assembly. It had been discussed in every part of the country by farmers\\n', 'and merchants, by mechanics and planters, by the fishermen along the\\n', 'coast and the backwoodsmen of the West; in town meetings and from the\\n', 'pulpit; at social gatherings and around the camp fires; in county\\n', 'conventions and conferences or committees; in colonial congresses and\\n', 'assemblies.\"\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Paine\\'s \"Commonsense.\"=--In the midst of this ferment of American\\n', 'opinion, a bold and eloquent pamphleteer broke in upon the hesitating\\n', 'public with a program for absolute independence, without fears and\\n', 'without apologies. In the early days of 1776, Thomas Paine issued the\\n', 'first of his famous tracts, \"Commonsense,\" a passionate attack upon the\\n', 'British monarchy and an equally passionate plea for American liberty.\\n', 'Casting aside the language of petition with which Americans had hitherto\\n', 'with many a violent epithet. He condemned monarchy itself as a system\\n', 'which had laid the world \"in blood and ashes.\" Instead of praising the\\n', 'British constitution under which colonists had been claiming their\\n', 'rights, he brushed it aside as ridiculous, protesting that it was \"owing\\n', 'to the constitution of the people, not to the constitution of the\\n', 'government, that the Crown is not as oppressive in England as in\\n', 'Turkey.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Having thus summarily swept away the grounds of allegiance to the old\\n', 'order, Paine proceeded relentlessly to an argument for immediate\\n', 'separation from Great Britain. There was nothing in the sphere of\\n', 'practical interest, he insisted, which should bind the colonies to the\\n', 'mother country. Allegiance to her had been responsible for the many wars\\n', 'in which they had been involved. Reasons of trade were not less weighty\\n', 'in behalf of independence. \"Our corn will fetch its price in any market\\n', 'in Europe and our imported goods must be paid for, buy them where we\\n', 'will.\" As to matters of government, \"it is not in the power of Britain\\n', 'to do this continent justice; the business of it will soon be too\\n', 'weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of\\n', 'convenience by a power so distant from us and so very ignorant of us.\"\\n', '\\n', 'There is accordingly no alternative to independence for America.\\n', '\"Everything that is right or natural pleads for separation. The blood of\\n', \"the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries ''tis time to part.' ...\\n\", 'Arms, the last resort, must decide the contest; the appeal was the\\n', 'choice of the king and the continent hath accepted the challenge.... The\\n', \"sun never shone on a cause of greater worth. 'Tis not the affair of a\\n\", \"city, a county, a province or a kingdom, but of a continent.... 'Tis not\\n\", 'the concern of a day, a year or an age; posterity is involved in the\\n', 'contest and will be more or less affected to the end of time by the\\n', 'proceedings now. Now is the seed-time of Continental union, faith, and\\n', 'tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth.... Let names of Whig and Tory be\\n', 'extinct. Let none other be heard among us than those of a good citizen,\\n', 'an open and resolute friend, and a virtuous supporter of the rights of\\n', 'mankind and of the free and independent states of America.\" As more than\\n', '100,000 copies were scattered broadcast over the country, patriots\\n', 'exclaimed with Washington: \"Sound doctrine and unanswerable reason!\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Drift of Events toward Independence.=--Official support for the\\n', 'idea of independence began to come from many quarters. On the tenth of\\n', 'February, 1776, Gadsden, in the provincial convention of South Carolina,\\n', 'advocated a new constitution for the colony and absolute independence\\n', 'for all America. The convention balked at the latter but went half way\\n', 'by abolishing the system of royal administration and establishing a\\n', 'neighboring state of North Carolina uttered the daring phrase from which\\n', 'others shrank. It empowered its representatives in the Congress to\\n', 'concur with the delegates of the other colonies in declaring\\n', 'independence. Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Virginia quickly\\n', 'responded to the challenge. The convention of the Old Dominion, on May\\n', '15, instructed its delegates at Philadelphia to propose the independence\\n', 'of the United Colonies and to give the assent of Virginia to the act of\\n', 'separation. When the resolution was carried the British flag on the\\n', 'state house was lowered for all time.\\n', '\\n', 'Meanwhile the Continental Congress was alive to the course of events\\n', 'outside. The subject of independence was constantly being raised. \"Are\\n', 'we rebels?\" exclaimed Wyeth of Virginia during a debate in February.\\n', '\"No: we must declare ourselves a free people.\" Others hesitated and\\n', 'spoke of waiting for the arrival of commissioners of conciliation. \"Is\\n', 'not America already independent?\" asked Samuel Adams a few weeks later.\\n', '\"Why not then declare it?\" Still there was uncertainty and delegates\\n', 'Congress declared that the authority of the British crown in America\\n', 'must be suppressed and advised the colonies to set up governments of\\n', 'their own.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Independence Declared.=--The way was fully prepared, therefore, when,\\n', 'on June 7, the Virginia delegation in the Congress moved that \"these\\n', 'united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent\\n', 'document setting forth the reasons for the act, and on July 2 all the\\n', 'states save New York went on record in favor of severing their political\\n', \"connection with Great Britain. Two days later, July 4, Jefferson's draft\\n\", 'of the Declaration of Independence, changed in some slight particulars,\\n', 'was adopted. The old bell in Independence Hall, as it is now known, rang\\n', 'out the glad tidings; couriers swiftly carried the news to the uttermost\\n', 'the powers of the world.\\n', '\\n', 'To some documents is given immortality. The Declaration of Independence\\n', 'is one of them. American patriotism is forever associated with it; but\\n', 'patriotism alone does not make it immortal. Neither does the vigor of\\n', 'its language or the severity of its indictment give it a secure place in\\n', 'the records of time. The secret of its greatness lies in the simple fact\\n', 'that it is one of the memorable landmarks in the history of a political\\n', 'ideal which for three centuries has been taking form and spreading\\n', 'throughout the earth, challenging kings and potentates, shaking down\\n', 'thrones and aristocracies, breaking the armies of irresponsible power on\\n', 'battle fields as far apart as Marston Moor and Chateau-Thierry. That\\n', 'ideal, now so familiar, then so novel, is summed up in the simple\\n', 'sentence: \"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\\n', 'governed.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Written in a \"decent respect for the opinions of mankind,\" to set forth\\n', 'the causes which impelled the American colonists to separate from\\n', 'Britain, the Declaration contained a long list of \"abuses and\\n', 'usurpations\" which had induced them to throw off the government of King\\n', 'George. That section of the Declaration has passed into \"ancient\"\\n', 'history and is seldom read. It is the part laying down a new basis for\\n', 'government and giving a new dignity to the common man that has become a\\n', 'household phrase in the Old World as in the New.\\n', '\\n', 'In the more enduring passages there are four fundamental ideas which,\\n', 'from the standpoint of the old system of government, were the essence of\\n', 'revolution: (1) all men are created equal and are endowed by their\\n', 'Creator with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the\\n', 'pursuit of happiness; (2) the purpose of government is to secure these\\n', 'governed; (4) whenever any form of government becomes destructive of\\n', 'these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and\\n', 'institute new government, laying its foundations on such principles and\\n', 'organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to\\n', 'effect their safety and happiness. Here was the prelude to the historic\\n', 'drama of democracy--a challenge to every form of government and every\\n', 'privilege not founded on popular assent.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Committees of Correspondence.=--As soon as debate had passed into\\n', 'armed resistance, the patriots found it necessary to consolidate their\\n', 'forces by organizing civil government. This was readily effected, for\\n', 'the means were at hand in town meetings, provincial legislatures, and\\n', 'committees of correspondence. The working tools of the Revolution were\\n', 'in fact the committees of correspondence--small, local, unofficial\\n', 'groups of patriots formed to exchange views and create public sentiment.\\n', 'As early as November, 1772, such a committee had been created in Boston\\n', 'under the leadership of Samuel Adams. It held regular meetings, sent\\n', 'emissaries to neighboring towns, and carried on a campaign of education\\n', 'in the doctrines of liberty.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Upon local organizations similar in character to the Boston committee\\n', 'were built county committees and then the larger colonial committees,\\n', 'congresses, and conventions, all unofficial and representing the\\n', 'revolutionary elements. Ordinarily the provincial convention was merely\\n', 'the old legislative assembly freed from all royalist sympathizers and\\n', 'controlled by patriots. Finally, upon these colonial assemblies was\\n', 'built the Continental Congress, the precursor of union under the\\n', 'Articles of Confederation and ultimately under the Constitution of the\\n', 'United States. This was the revolutionary government set up within the\\n', 'British empire in America.\\n', '\\n', '=State Constitutions Framed.=--With the rise of these new assemblies of\\n', 'the people, the old colonial governments broke down. From the royal\\n', 'provinces the governor, the judges, and the high officers fled in haste,\\n', 'and it became necessary to substitute patriot authorities. The appeal to\\n', 'the colonies advising them to adopt a new form of government for\\n', 'themselves, issued by the Congress in May, 1776, was quickly acted upon.\\n', 'Before the expiration of a year, Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\\n', 'Delaware, Maryland, Georgia, and New York had drafted new constitutions\\n', 'as states, not as colonies uncertain of their destinies. Connecticut and\\n', 'Rhode Island, holding that their ancient charters were equal to their\\n', 'needs, merely renounced their allegiance to the king and went on as\\n', 'before so far as the form of government was concerned. South Carolina,\\n', 'which had drafted a temporary plan early in 1776, drew up a new and more\\n', 'complete constitution in 1778. Two years later Massachusetts with much\\n', 'deliberation put into force its fundamental law, which in most of its\\n', 'essential features remains unchanged to-day.\\n', '\\n', 'The new state constitutions in their broad outlines followed colonial\\n', 'models. For the royal governor was substituted a governor or president\\n', 'chosen usually by the legislature; but in two instances, New York and\\n', 'Massachusetts, by popular vote. For the provincial council there was\\n', 'substituted, except in Georgia, a senate; while the lower house, or\\n', 'assembly, was continued virtually without change. The old property\\n', 'restriction on the suffrage, though lowered slightly in some states, was\\n', 'continued in full force to the great discontent of the mechanics thus\\n', 'deprived of the ballot. The special qualifications, laid down in several\\n', 'constitutions, for governors, senators, and representatives, indicated\\n', 'that the revolutionary leaders were not prepared for any radical\\n', 'experiments in democracy. The protests of a few women, like Mrs. John\\n', 'Adams of Massachusetts and Mrs. Henry Corbin of Virginia, against a\\n', 'government which excluded them from political rights were treated as\\n', 'mild curiosities of no significance, although in New Jersey women were\\n', 'allowed to vote for many years on the same terms as men.\\n', '\\n', 'By the new state constitutions the signs and symbols of royal power, of\\n', 'authority derived from any source save \"the people,\" were swept aside\\n', 'and republican governments on an imposing scale presented for the first\\n', 'time to the modern world. Copies of these remarkable documents prepared\\n', 'by plain citizens were translated into French and widely circulated in\\n', 'Europe. There they were destined to serve as a guide and inspiration to\\n', 'a generation of constitution-makers whose mission it was to begin the\\n', 'democratic revolution in the Old World.\\n', '\\n', '=The Articles of Confederation.=--The formation of state constitutions\\n', 'was an easy task for the revolutionary leaders. They had only to build\\n', 'on foundations already laid. The establishment of a national system of\\n', 'government was another matter. There had always been, it must be\\n', 'remembered, a system of central control over the colonies, but Americans\\n', 'had had little experience in its operation. When the supervision of the\\n', 'crown of Great Britain was suddenly broken, the patriot leaders,\\n', 'accustomed merely to provincial statesmanship, were poorly trained for\\n', 'action on a national stage.\\n', '\\n', 'Many forces worked against those who, like Franklin, had a vision of\\n', 'national destiny. There were differences in economic interest--commerce\\n', 'and industry in the North and the planting system of the South. There\\n', 'were contests over the apportionment of taxes and the quotas of troops\\n', 'for common defense. To these practical difficulties were added local\\n', 'pride, the vested rights of state and village politicians in their\\n', 'provincial dignity, and the scarcity of men with a large outlook upon\\n', 'the common enterprise.\\n', '\\n', 'Nevertheless, necessity compelled them to consider some sort of\\n', 'federation. The second Continental Congress had hardly opened its work\\n', 'before the most sagacious leaders began to urge the desirability of a\\n', 'permanent connection. As early as July, 1775, Congress resolved to go\\n', 'into a committee of the whole on the state of the union, and Franklin,\\n', 'undaunted by the fate of his Albany plan of twenty years before, again\\n', 'presented a draft of a constitution. Long and desultory debates followed\\n', 'and it was not until late in 1777 that Congress presented to the states\\n', 'the Articles of Confederation. Provincial jealousies delayed\\n', 'ratification, and it was the spring of 1781, a few months before the\\n', 'surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, when Maryland, the last of the\\n', 'states, approved the Articles. This plan of union, though it was all\\n', 'that could be wrung from the reluctant states, provided for neither a\\n', 'chief executive nor a system of federal courts. It created simply a\\n', 'Congress of delegates in which each state had an equal voice and gave it\\n', 'the right to call upon the state legislatures for the sinews of\\n', 'government--money and soldiers.\\n', '\\n', '=The Application of Tests of Allegiance.=--As the successive steps were\\n', 'taken in the direction of independent government, the patriots devised\\n', 'and applied tests designed to discover who were for and who were against\\n', 'the new nation in the process of making. When the first Continental\\n', 'Congress agreed not to allow the importation of British goods, it\\n', 'provided for the creation of local committees to enforce the rules. Such\\n', 'agencies were duly formed by the choice of men favoring the scheme, all\\n', 'opponents being excluded from the elections. Before these bodies those\\n', 'who persisted in buying British goods were summoned and warned or\\n', 'punished according to circumstances. As soon as the new state\\n', 'constitutions were put into effect, local committees set to work in the\\n', 'same way to ferret out all who were not outspoken in their support of\\n', 'the new order of things.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'These patriot agencies, bearing different names in different sections,\\n', 'were sometimes ruthless in their methods. They called upon all men to\\n', 'sign the test of loyalty, frequently known as the \"association test.\"\\n', 'Those who refused were promptly branded as outlaws, while some of the\\n', 'more dangerous were thrown into jail. The prison camp in Connecticut at\\n', 'one time held the former governor of New Jersey and the mayor of New\\n', 'York. Thousands were black-listed and subjected to espionage. The\\n', 'black-list of Pennsylvania contained the names of nearly five hundred\\n', 'persons of prominence who were under suspicion. Loyalists or Tories who\\n', 'were bold enough to speak and write against the Revolution were\\n', 'suppressed and their pamphlets burned. In many places, particularly in\\n', 'the North, the property of the loyalists was confiscated and the\\n', 'proceeds applied to the cause of the Revolution.\\n', '\\n', 'The work of the official agencies for suppression of opposition was\\n', 'trial, and others were tarred and feathered. One was placed upon a cake\\n', 'of ice and held there \"until his loyalty to King George might cool.\"\\n', 'Whole families were driven out of their homes to find their way as best\\n', 'they could within the British lines or into Canada, where the British\\n', 'government gave them lands. Such excesses were deplored by Washington,\\n', 'but they were defended on the ground that in effect a civil war, as well\\n', 'as a war for independence, was being waged.\\n', '\\n', '=The Patriots and Tories.=--Thus, by one process or another, those who\\n', 'were to be citizens of the new republic were separated from those who\\n', 'preferred to be subjects of King George. Just what proportion of the\\n', 'Americans favored independence and what share remained loyal to the\\n', 'British monarchy there is no way of knowing. The question of revolution\\n', 'was not submitted to popular vote, and on the point of numbers we have\\n', 'conflicting evidence. On the patriot side, there is the testimony of a\\n', 'careful and informed observer, John Adams, who asserted that two-thirds\\n', 'of the people were for the American cause and not more than one-third\\n', 'opposed the Revolution at all stages.\\n', '\\n', 'On behalf of the loyalists, or Tories as they were popularly known,\\n', 'extravagant claims were made. Joseph Galloway, who had been a member of\\n', 'the first Continental Congress and had fled to England when he saw its\\n', 'temper, testified before a committee of Parliament in 1779 that not\\n', 'one-fifth of the American people supported the insurrection and that\\n', '\"many more than four-fifths of the people prefer a union with Great\\n', 'Britain upon constitutional principles to independence.\" At the same\\n', 'time General Robertson, who had lived in America twenty-four years,\\n', 'declared that \"more than two-thirds of the people would prefer the\\n', 'king\\'s government to the Congress\\' tyranny.\" In an address to the king\\n', 'in that year a committee of American loyalists asserted that \"the number\\n', \"of Americans in his Majesty's army exceeded the number of troops\\n\", 'enlisted by Congress to oppose them.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Character of the Loyalists.=--When General Howe evacuated Boston,\\n', 'more than a thousand people fled with him. This great company, according\\n', 'to a careful historian, \"formed the aristocracy of the province by\\n', 'virtue of their official rank; of their dignified callings and\\n', 'professions; of their hereditary wealth and of their culture.\" The act\\n', 'of banishment passed by Massachusetts in 1778, listing over 300 Tories,\\n', '\"reads like the social register of the oldest and noblest families of\\n', 'New England,\" more than one out of five being graduates of Harvard\\n', 'College. The same was true of New York and Philadelphia; namely, that\\n', 'the leading loyalists were prominent officials of the old order,\\n', 'clergymen and wealthy merchants. With passion the loyalists fought\\n', 'against the inevitable or with anguish of heart they left as refugees\\n', 'for a life of uncertainty in Canada or the mother country.\\n', '\\n', '=Tories Assail the Patriots.=--The Tories who remained in America joined\\n', 'the British army by the thousands or in other ways aided the royal\\n', 'cause. Those who were skillful with the pen assailed the patriots in\\n', 'editorials, rhymes, satires, and political catechisms. They declared\\n', 'that the members of Congress were \"obscure, pettifogging attorneys,\\n', 'bankrupt shopkeepers, outlawed smugglers, etc.\" The people and their\\n', 'leaders they characterized as \"wretched banditti ... the refuse and\\n', 'dregs of mankind.\" The generals in the army they sneered at as \"men of\\n', 'rank and honor nearly on a par with those of the Congress.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Patriot Writers Arouse the National Spirit.=--Stung by Tory taunts,\\n', 'patriot writers devoted themselves to creating and sustaining a public\\n', 'opinion favorable to the American cause. Moreover, they had to combat\\n', 'the depression that grew out of the misfortunes in the early days of the\\n', 'winter of 1775 as they attempted to bring Canada into the revolution--a\\n', 'disaster that cost 5000 men; repeated calamities harassed Washington in\\n', '1776 as he was defeated on Long Island, driven out of New York City, and\\n', 'beaten at Harlem Heights and White Plains. These reverses were almost\\n', 'too great for the stoutest patriots.\\n', '\\n', 'Pamphleteers, preachers, and publicists rose, however, to meet the needs\\n', 'of the hour. John Witherspoon, provost of the College of New Jersey,\\n', 'forsook the classroom for the field of political controversy. The poet,\\n', 'Philip Freneau, flung taunts of cowardice at the Tories and celebrated\\n', 'the spirit of liberty in many a stirring poem. Songs, ballads, plays,\\n', 'and satires flowed from the press in an unending stream. Fast days,\\n', 'battle anniversaries, celebrations of important steps taken by Congress\\n', 'afforded to patriotic clergymen abundant opportunities for sermons.\\n', '\"Does Mr. Wiberd preach against oppression?\" anxiously inquired John\\n', 'Adams in a letter to his wife. The answer was decisive. \"The clergy of\\n', 'every denomination, not excepting the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten\\n', 'every Sabbath. They pray for Boston and Massachusetts. They thank God\\n', 'most explicitly and fervently for our remarkable successes. They pray\\n', 'for the American army.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Thomas Paine never let his pen rest. He had been with the forces of\\n', 'Washington when they retreated from Fort Lee and were harried from New\\n', 'Jersey into Pennsylvania. He knew the effect of such reverses on the\\n', 'army as well as on the public. In December, 1776, he made a second great\\n', 'appeal to his countrymen in his pamphlet, \"The Crisis,\" the first part\\n', 'of which he had written while defeat and gloom were all about him. This\\n', 'tract was a cry for continued support of the Revolution. \"These are the\\n', 'times that try men\\'s souls,\" he opened. \"The summer soldier and the\\n', 'sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his\\n', 'country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men\\n', 'and women.\" Paine laid his lash fiercely on the Tories, branding every\\n', 'one as a coward grounded in \"servile, slavish, self-interested fear.\" He\\n', 'deplored the inadequacy of the militia and called for a real army. He\\n', 'refuted the charge that the retreat through New Jersey was a disaster\\n', 'and he promised victory soon. \"By perseverance and fortitude,\" he\\n', 'concluded, \"we have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and\\n', 'submission the sad choice of a variety of evils--a ravaged country, a\\n', 'depopulated city, habitations without safety and slavery without\\n', 'hope.... Look on this picture and weep over it.\" His ringing call to\\n', 'arms was followed by another and another until the long contest was\\n', 'over.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Two Phases of the War.=--The war which opened with the battle of\\n', 'Lexington, on April 19, 1775, and closed with the surrender of\\n', 'Cornwallis at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, passed through two distinct\\n', 'phases--the first lasting until the treaty of alliance with France, in\\n', '1778, and the second until the end of the struggle. During the first\\n', 'phase, the war was confined mainly to the North. The outstanding\\n', 'features of the contest were the evacuation of Boston by the British,\\n', 'the expulsion of American forces from New York and their retreat through\\n', 'New Jersey, the battle of Trenton, the seizure of Philadelphia by the\\n', 'British (September, 1777), the invasion of New York by Burgoyne and his\\n', 'capture at Saratoga in October, 1777, and the encampment of American\\n', 'forces at Valley Forge for the terrible winter of 1777-78.\\n', '\\n', 'The final phase of the war, opening with the treaty of alliance with\\n', 'France on February 6, 1778, was confined mainly to the Middle states,\\n', 'the West, and the South. In the first sphere of action the chief events\\n', 'were the withdrawal of the British from Philadelphia, the battle of\\n', 'Monmouth, and the inclosure of the British in New York by deploying\\n', 'American forces from Morristown, New Jersey, up to West Point. In the\\n', 'West, George Rogers Clark, by his famous march into the Illinois\\n', 'country, secured Kaskaskia and Vincennes and laid a firm grip on the\\n', 'country between the Ohio and the Great Lakes. In the South, the second\\n', 'period opened with successes for the British. They captured Savannah,\\n', 'conquered Georgia, and restored the royal governor. In 1780 they seized\\n', 'Charleston, administered a crushing defeat to the American forces under\\n', 'Gates at Camden, and overran South Carolina, though meeting reverses at\\n', \"Cowpens and King's Mountain. Then came the closing scenes. Cornwallis\\n\", 'began the last of his operations. He pursued General Greene far into\\n', 'North Carolina, clashed with him at Guilford Court House, retired to the\\n', 'coast, took charge of British forces engaged in plundering Virginia, and\\n', 'fortified Yorktown, where he was penned up by the French fleet from the\\n', 'sea and the combined French and American forces on land.\\n', '\\n', '=The Geographical Aspects of the War.=--For the British the theater of\\n', 'the war offered many problems. From first to last it extended from\\n', 'Massachusetts to Georgia, a distance of almost a thousand miles. It was\\n', 'nearly three thousand miles from the main base of supplies and, though\\n', 'the British navy kept the channel open, transports were constantly\\n', 'falling prey to daring privateers and fleet American war vessels. The\\n', 'sea, on the other hand, offered an easy means of transportation between\\n', 'points along the coast and gave ready access to the American centers of\\n', 'wealth and population. Of this the British made good use. Though early\\n', 'forced to give up Boston, they seized New York and kept it until the end\\n', 'of the war; they took Philadelphia and retained it until threatened by\\n', 'the approach of the French fleet; and they captured and held both\\n', 'Savannah and Charleston. Wars, however, are seldom won by the conquest\\n', 'of cities.\\n', '\\n', 'Particularly was this true in the case of the Revolution. Only a small\\n', 'portion of the American people lived in towns. Countrymen back from the\\n', 'coast were in no way dependent upon them for a livelihood. They lived on\\n', 'the produce of the soil, not upon the profits of trade. This very fact\\n', 'gave strength to them in the contest. Whenever the British ventured far\\n', 'from the ports of entry, they encountered reverses. Burgoyne was forced\\n', 'to surrender at Saratoga because he was surrounded and cut off from his\\n', 'base of supplies. As soon as the British got away from Charleston, they\\n', 'were harassed and worried by the guerrilla warriors of Marion, Sumter,\\n', 'and Pickens. Cornwallis could technically defeat Greene at Guilford far\\n', 'in the interior; but he could not hold the inland region he had invaded.\\n', 'Sustained by their own labor, possessing the interior to which their\\n', 'armies could readily retreat, supplied mainly from native resources, the\\n', 'Americans could not be hemmed in, penned up, and destroyed at one fell\\n', 'blow.\\n', '\\n', '=The Sea Power.=--The British made good use of their fleet in cutting\\n', 'off American trade, but control of the sea did not seriously affect the\\n', 'United States. As an agricultural country, the ruin of its commerce was\\n', 'not such a vital matter. All the materials for a comfortable though\\n', 'somewhat rude life were right at hand. It made little difference to a\\n', 'nation fighting for existence, if silks, fine linens, and chinaware were\\n', 'cut off. This was an evil to which submission was necessary.\\n', '\\n', 'Nor did the brilliant exploits of John Paul Jones and Captain John Barry\\n', 'materially change the situation. They demonstrated the skill of American\\n', 'seamen and their courage as fighting men. They raised the rates of\\n', 'British marine insurance, but they did not dethrone the mistress of the\\n', 'seas. Less spectacular, and more distinctive, were the deeds of the\\n', 'hundreds of privateers and minor captains who overhauled British supply\\n', 'ships and kept British merchantmen in constant anxiety. Not until the\\n', 'French fleet was thrown into the scale, were the British compelled to\\n', 'reckon seriously with the enemy on the sea and make plans based upon the\\n', 'possibilities of a maritime disaster.\\n', '\\n', '=Commanding Officers.=--On the score of military leadership it is\\n', 'difficult to compare the contending forces in the revolutionary contest.\\n', 'There is no doubt that all the British commanders were men of experience\\n', 'in the art of warfare. Sir William Howe had served in America during the\\n', 'French War and was accounted an excellent officer, a strict\\n', 'disciplinarian, and a gallant gentleman. Nevertheless he loved ease,\\n', 'society, and good living, and his expulsion from Boston, his failure to\\n', 'overwhelm Washington by sallies from his comfortable bases at New York\\n', 'and Philadelphia, destroyed every shred of his military reputation. John\\n', 'Burgoyne, to whom was given the task of penetrating New York from\\n', 'Canada, had likewise seen service in the French War both in America and\\n', 'Europe. He had, however, a touch of the theatrical in his nature and\\n', 'after the collapse of his plans and the surrender of his army in 1777,\\n', 'he devoted his time mainly to light literature. Sir Henry Clinton, who\\n', 'directed the movement which ended in the capture of Charleston in 1780,\\n', 'had \"learned his trade on the continent,\" and was regarded as a man of\\n', 'discretion and understanding in military matters. Lord Cornwallis, whose\\n', 'achievements at Camden and Guilford were blotted out by his surrender at\\n', \"Yorktown, had seen service in the Seven Years' War and had undoubted\\n\", 'talents which he afterward displayed with great credit to himself in\\n', 'India. Though none of them, perhaps, were men of first-rate ability,\\n', 'they all had training and experience to guide them.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The Americans had a host in Washington himself. He had long been\\n', 'interested in military strategy and had tested his coolness under fire\\n', 'during the first clashes with the French nearly twenty years before. He\\n', 'had no doubts about the justice of his cause, such as plagued some of\\n', 'the British generals. He was a stern but reasonable disciplinarian. He\\n', 'was reserved and patient, little given to exaltation at success or\\n', 'depression at reverses. In the dark hour of the Revolution, \"what held\\n', 'the patriot forces together?\" asks Beveridge in his _Life of John\\n', 'Marshall_. Then he answers: \"George Washington and he alone. Had he\\n', 'died or been seriously disabled, the Revolution would have ended....\\n', 'Washington was the soul of the American cause. Washington was the\\n', 'government. Washington was the Revolution.\" The weakness of Congress in\\n', 'furnishing men and supplies, the indolence of civilians, who lived at\\n', 'ease while the army starved, the intrigues of army officers against him\\n', 'such as the \"Conway cabal,\" the cowardice of Lee at Monmouth, even the\\n', 'treason of Benedict Arnold, while they stirred deep emotions in his\\n', 'breast and aroused him to make passionate pleas to his countrymen, did\\n', 'not shake his iron will or his firm determination to see the war through\\n', \"to the bitter end. The weight of Washington's moral force was\\n\", 'immeasurable.\\n', '\\n', 'Of the generals who served under him, none can really be said to have\\n', 'been experienced military men when the war opened. Benedict Arnold, the\\n', 'unhappy traitor but brave and daring soldier, was a druggist, book\\n', 'seller, and ship owner at New Haven when the news of Lexington called\\n', 'him to battle. Horatio Gates was looked upon as a \"seasoned soldier\"\\n', 'because he had entered the British army as a youth, had been wounded at\\n', \"Braddock's memorable defeat, and had served with credit during the Seven\\n\", \"Years' War; but he was the most conspicuous failure of the Revolution.\\n\", 'The triumph over Burgoyne was the work of other men; and his crushing\\n', 'defeat at Camden put an end to his military pretensions. Nathanael\\n', 'Greene was a Rhode Island farmer and smith without military experience\\n', \"who, when convinced that war was coming, read Caesar's _Commentaries_ and\\n\", 'took up the sword. Francis Marion was a shy and modest planter of South\\n', 'Carolina whose sole passage at arms had been a brief but desperate brush\\n', 'with the Indians ten or twelve years earlier. Daniel Morgan, one of the\\n', \"heroes of Cowpens, had been a teamster with Braddock's army and had seen\\n\", 'some fighting during the French and Indian War, but his military\\n', 'knowledge, from the point of view of a trained British officer, was\\n', 'negligible. John Sullivan was a successful lawyer at Durham, New\\n', 'Hampshire, and a major in the local militia when duty summoned him to\\n', 'lay down his briefs and take up the sword. Anthony Wayne was a\\n', 'Pennsylvania farmer and land surveyor who, on hearing the clash of arms,\\n', 'read a few books on war, raised a regiment, and offered himself for\\n', 'service. Such is the story of the chief American military leaders, and\\n', 'it is typical of them all. Some had seen fighting with the French and\\n', 'Indians, but none of them had seen warfare on a large scale with regular\\n', 'troops commanded according to the strategy evolved in European\\n', 'experience. Courage, native ability, quickness of mind, and knowledge of\\n', 'the country they had in abundance, and in battles such as were fought\\n', 'during the Revolution all those qualities counted heavily in the\\n', 'balance.\\n', '\\n', '=Foreign Officers in American Service.=--To native genius was added\\n', 'military talent from beyond the seas. Baron Steuben, well schooled in\\n', 'the iron regime of Frederick the Great, came over from Prussia, joined\\n', 'Washington at Valley Forge, and day after day drilled and manoeuvered the\\n', 'men, laughing and cursing as he turned raw countrymen into regular\\n', 'soldiers. From France came young Lafayette and the stern De Kalb, from\\n', 'Poland came Pulaski and Kosciusko;--all acquainted with the arts of war\\n', 'as waged in Europe and fitted for leadership as well as teaching.\\n', 'Lafayette came early, in 1776, in a ship of his own, accompanied by\\n', 'several officers of wide experience, and remained loyally throughout the\\n', 'war sharing the hardships of American army life. Pulaski fell at the\\n', 'siege of Savannah and De Kalb at Camden. Kosciusko survived the American\\n', 'war to defend in vain the independence of his native land. To these\\n', 'distinguished foreigners, who freely threw in their lot with American\\n', 'revolutionary fortunes, was due much of that spirit and discipline which\\n', 'fitted raw recruits and temperamental militiamen to cope with a military\\n', 'power of the first rank.\\n', '\\n', '=The Soldiers.=--As far as the British soldiers were concerned their\\n', 'annals are short and simple. The regulars from the standing army who\\n', 'were sent over at the opening of the contest, the recruits drummed up\\n', 'by special efforts at home, and the thousands of Hessians bought\\n', 'outright by King George presented few problems of management to the\\n', 'British officers. These common soldiers were far away from home and\\n', 'enlisted for the war. Nearly all of them were well disciplined and many\\n', 'of them experienced in actual campaigns. The armies of King George\\n', 'fought bravely, as the records of Bunker Hill, Brandywine, and Monmouth\\n', 'demonstrate. Many a man and subordinate officer and, for that matter,\\n', 'some of the high officers expressed a reluctance at fighting against\\n', 'their own kin; but they obeyed orders.\\n', '\\n', 'The Americans, on the other hand, while they fought with grim\\n', 'determination, as men fighting for their homes, were lacking in\\n', 'discipline and in the experience of regular troops. When the war broke\\n', 'in upon them, there were no common preparations for it. There was no\\n', 'continental army; there were only local bands of militiamen, many of\\n', 'them experienced in fighting but few of them \"regulars\" in the military\\n', 'sense. Moreover they were volunteers serving for a short time,\\n', 'unaccustomed to severe discipline, and impatient at the restraints\\n', 'imposed on them by long and arduous campaigns. They were continually\\n', 'leaving the service just at the most critical moments. \"The militia,\"\\n', 'lamented Washington, \"come in, you cannot tell how; go, you cannot tell\\n', 'where; consume your provisions; exhaust your stores; and leave you at\\n', 'last at a critical moment.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Again and again Washington begged Congress to provide for an army of\\n', 'regulars enlisted for the war, thoroughly trained and paid according to\\n', 'some definite plan. At last he was able to overcome, in part at least,\\n', 'the chronic fear of civilians in Congress and to wring from that\\n', 'reluctant body an agreement to grant half pay to all officers and a\\n', 'bonus to all privates who served until the end of the war. Even this\\n', 'scheme, which Washington regarded as far short of justice to the\\n', 'soldiers, did not produce quick results. It was near the close of the\\n', 'conflict before he had an army of well-disciplined veterans capable of\\n', 'meeting British regulars on equal terms.\\n', '\\n', 'Though there were times when militiamen and frontiersmen did valiant and\\n', 'effective work, it is due to historical accuracy to deny the\\n', 'time-honored tradition that a few minutemen overwhelmed more numerous\\n', \"forces of regulars in a seven years' war for independence. They did\\n\", 'nothing of the sort. For the victories of Bennington, Trenton, Saratoga,\\n', 'and Yorktown there were the defeats of Bunker Hill, Long Island, White\\n', 'Plains, Germantown, and Camden. Not once did an army of militiamen\\n', 'overcome an equal number of British regulars in an open trial by battle.\\n', '\"To bring men to be well acquainted with the duties of a soldier,\" wrote\\n', 'Washington, \"requires time.... To expect the same service from raw and\\n', 'undisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers is to expect what never\\n', 'did and perhaps never will happen.\"\\n', '\\n', '=How the War Was Won.=--Then how did the American army win the war? For\\n', 'one thing there were delays and blunders on the part of the British\\n', 'generals who, in 1775 and 1776, dallied in Boston and New York with\\n', 'large bodies of regular troops when they might have been dealing\\n', 'paralyzing blows at the scattered bands that constituted the American\\n', 'army. \"Nothing but the supineness or folly of the enemy could have saved\\n', 'us,\" solemnly averred Washington in 1780. Still it is fair to say that\\n', 'this apparent supineness was not all due to the British generals. The\\n', 'ministers behind them believed that a large part of the colonists were\\n', 'loyal and that compromise would be promoted by inaction rather than by a\\n', 'war vigorously prosecuted. Victory by masterly inactivity was obviously\\n', 'better than conquest, and the slighter the wounds the quicker the\\n', 'healing. Later in the conflict when the seasoned forces of France were\\n', 'thrown into the scale, the Americans themselves had learned many things\\n', 'about the practical conduct of campaigns. All along, the British were\\n', 'embarrassed by the problem of supplies. Their troops could not forage\\n', 'with the skill of militiamen, as they were in unfamiliar territory. The\\n', 'long oversea voyages were uncertain at best and doubly so when the\\n', 'warships of France joined the American privateers in preying on supply\\n', 'boats.\\n', '\\n', 'The British were in fact battered and worn down by a guerrilla war and\\n', 'outdone on two important occasions by superior forces--at Saratoga and\\n', 'Yorktown. Stern facts convinced them finally that an immense army, which\\n', 'could be raised only by a supreme effort, would be necessary to subdue\\n', 'the colonies if that hazardous enterprise could be accomplished at all.\\n', 'They learned also that America would then be alienated, fretful, and the\\n', 'scene of endless uprisings calling for an army of occupation. That was a\\n', 'were forces of opposition at home with which they had to reckon.\\n', '\\n', '=Women and the War.=--At no time were the women of America indifferent\\n', 'to the struggle for independence. When it was confined to the realm of\\n', 'opinion they did their part in creating public sentiment. Mrs. Elizabeth\\n', 'Timothee, for example, founded in Charleston, in 1773, a newspaper to\\n', 'espouse the cause of the province. Far to the north the sister of James\\n', 'Otis, Mrs. Mercy Warren, early begged her countrymen to rest their case\\n', 'upon their natural rights, and in influential circles she urged the\\n', 'leaders to stand fast by their principles. While John Adams was tossing\\n', 'about with uncertainty at the Continental Congress, his wife was writing\\n', 'letters to him declaring her faith in \"independency.\"\\n', '\\n', 'When the war came down upon the country, women helped in every field. In\\n', 'sustaining public sentiment they were active. Mrs. Warren with a\\n', 'tireless pen combatted loyalist propaganda in many a drama and satire.\\n', 'Almost every revolutionary leader had a wife or daughter who rendered\\n', 'service in the \"second line of defense.\" Mrs. Washington managed the\\n', 'plantation while the General was at the front and went north to face the\\n', 'rigors of the awful winter at Valley Forge--an inspiration to her\\n', 'husband and his men. The daughter of Benjamin Franklin, Mrs. Sarah\\n', 'Bache, while her father was pleading the American cause in France, set\\n', 'the women of Pennsylvania to work sewing and collecting supplies. Even\\n', 'near the firing line women were to be found, aiding the wounded, hauling\\n', 'powder to the front, and carrying dispatches at the peril of their\\n', 'lives.\\n', '\\n', 'In the economic sphere, the work of women was invaluable. They harvested\\n', 'crops without enjoying the picturesque title of \"farmerettes\" and they\\n', 'canned and preserved for the wounded and the prisoners of war. Of their\\n', 'labor in spinning and weaving it is recorded: \"Immediately on being cut\\n', 'off from the use of English manufactures, the women engaged within their\\n', 'own families in manufacturing various kinds of cloth for domestic use.\\n', 'They thus kept their households decently clad and the surplus of their\\n', 'labors they sold to such as chose to buy rather than make for\\n', 'themselves. In this way the female part of families by their industry\\n', 'and strict economy frequently supported the whole domestic circle,\\n', 'evincing the strength of their attachment and the value of their\\n', 'service.\"\\n', '\\n', 'For their war work, women were commended by high authorities on more\\n', 'than one occasion. They were given medals and public testimonials even\\n', 'as in our own day. Washington thanked them for their labors and paid\\n', 'tribute to them for the inspiration and material aid which they had\\n', 'given to the cause of independence.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'When the Revolution opened, there were thirteen little treasuries in\\n', 'America but no common treasury, and from first to last the Congress was\\n', 'in the position of a beggar rather than a sovereign. Having no authority\\n', 'to lay and collect taxes directly and knowing the hatred of the\\n', 'provincials for taxation, it resorted mainly to loans and paper money to\\n', 'finance the war. \"Do you think,\" boldly inquired one of the delegates,\\n', 'to the printer and get a wagon load of money, one quire of which will\\n', 'pay for the whole?\"\\n', '\\n', '=Paper Money and Loans.=--Acting on this curious but appealing political\\n', 'economy, Congress issued in June, 1776, two million dollars in bills of\\n', 'credit to be redeemed by the states on the basis of their respective\\n', 'populations. Other issues followed in quick succession. In all about\\n', '$241,000,000 of continental paper was printed, to which the several\\n', 'states added nearly $210,000,000 of their own notes. Then came\\n', 'interest-bearing bonds in ever increasing quantities. Several millions\\n', 'were also borrowed from France and small sums from Holland and Spain. In\\n', 'desperation a national lottery was held, producing meager results. The\\n', 'property of Tories was confiscated and sold, bringing in about\\n', '$16,000,000. Begging letters were sent to the states asking them to\\n', 'raise revenues for the continental treasury, but the states, burdened\\n', 'with their own affairs, gave little heed.\\n', '\\n', '=Inflation and Depreciation.=--As paper money flowed from the press, it\\n', 'rapidly declined in purchasing power until in 1779 a dollar was worth\\n', 'only two or three cents in gold or silver. Attempts were made by\\n', 'Congress and the states to compel people to accept the notes at face\\n', 'value; but these were like attempts to make water flow uphill.\\n', 'Speculators collected at once to fatten on the calamities of the\\n', 'republic. Fortunes were made and lost gambling on the prices of public\\n', 'securities while the patriot army, half clothed, was freezing at Valley\\n', 'Forge. \"Speculation, peculation, engrossing, forestalling,\" exclaimed\\n', 'Washington, \"afford too many melancholy proofs of the decay of public\\n', '... aided by stock jobbing and party dissensions has fed the hopes of\\n', 'the enemy.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Patriot Financiers.=--To the efforts of Congress in financing the\\n', 'war were added the labors of private citizens. Hayn Solomon, a merchant\\n', 'of Philadelphia, supplied members of Congress, including Madison,\\n', 'Jefferson, and Monroe, and army officers, like Lee and Steuben, with\\n', 'money for their daily needs. All together he contributed the huge sum of\\n', 'half a million dollars to the American cause and died broken in purse,\\n', 'if not in spirit, a British prisoner of war. Another Philadelphia\\n', 'merchant, Robert Morris, won for himself the name of the \"patriot\\n', 'financier\" because he labored night and day to find the money to meet\\n', 'the bills which poured in upon the bankrupt government. When his own\\n', 'funds were exhausted, he borrowed from his friends. Experienced in the\\n', 'handling of merchandise, he created agencies at important points to\\n', 'distribute supplies to the troops, thus displaying administrative as\\n', 'well as financial talents.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Women organized \"drives\" for money, contributed their plate and their\\n', 'jewels, and collected from door to door. Farmers took worthless paper in\\n', 'return for their produce, and soldiers saw many a pay day pass without\\n', 'yielding them a penny. Thus by the labors and sacrifices of citizens,\\n', 'the issuance of paper money, lotteries, the floating of loans,\\n', 'borrowings in Europe, and the impressment of supplies, the Congress\\n', 'staggered through the Revolution like a pauper who knows not how his\\n', 'next meal is to be secured but is continuously relieved at a crisis by a\\n', 'kindly fate.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'When the full measure of honor is given to the soldiers and sailors and\\n', 'their commanding officers, the civilians who managed finances and\\n', 'supplies, the writers who sustained the American spirit, and the women\\n', 'who did well their part, there yet remains the duty of recognizing the\\n', 'achievements of diplomacy. The importance of this field of activity was\\n', 'keenly appreciated by the leaders in the Continental Congress. They were\\n', 'fairly well versed in European history. They knew of the balance of\\n', 'power and the sympathies, interests, and prejudices of nations and their\\n', 'rulers. All this information they turned to good account, in opening\\n', 'relations with continental countries and seeking money, supplies, and\\n', 'even military assistance. For the transaction of this delicate business,\\n', 'they created a secret committee on foreign correspondence as early as\\n', '1775 and prepared to send agents abroad.\\n', '\\n', '=American Agents Sent Abroad.=--Having heard that France was inclining a\\n', 'friendly ear to the American cause, the Congress, in March, 1776, sent a\\n', 'commissioner to Paris, Silas Deane of Connecticut, often styled the\\n', '\"first American diplomat.\" Later in the year a form of treaty to be\\n', 'presented to foreign powers was drawn up, and Franklin, Arthur Lee, and\\n', 'Deane were selected as American representatives at the court of \"His\\n', 'Most Christian Majesty the King of France.\" John Jay of New York was\\n', 'chosen minister to Spain in 1779; John Adams was sent to Holland the\\n', 'same year; and other agents were dispatched to Florence, Vienna, and\\n', 'Berlin. The representative selected for St. Petersburg spent two\\n', 'fruitless years there, \"ignored by the court, living in obscurity and\\n', 'experiencing nothing but humiliation and failure.\" Frederick the Great,\\n', 'king of Prussia, expressed a desire to find in America a market for\\n', \"Silesian linens and woolens, but, fearing England's command of the sea,\\n\", 'he refused to give direct aid to the Revolutionary cause.\\n', '\\n', '=Early French Interest.=--The great diplomatic triumph of the Revolution\\n', 'was won at Paris, and Benjamin Franklin was the hero of the occasion,\\n', 'although many circumstances prepared the way for his success. Louis\\n', 'American representative, had brought to the attention of the king the\\n', 'opportunity offered by the outbreak of the war between England and her\\n', 'colonies. He showed him how France could redress her grievances and\\n', '\"reduce the power and greatness of England\"--the empire that in 1763 had\\n', 'forced upon her a humiliating peace \"at the price of our possessions,\\n', 'of our commerce, and our credit in the Indies, at the price of Canada,\\n', 'Louisiana, Isle Royale, Acadia, and Senegal.\" Equally successful in\\n', \"gaining the king's interest was a curious French adventurer,\\n\", 'Beaumarchais, a man of wealth, a lover of music, and the author of two\\n', 'popular plays, \"Figaro\" and \"The Barber of Seville.\" These two men had\\n', 'already urged upon the king secret aid for America before Deane appeared\\n', 'on the scene. Shortly after his arrival they made confidential\\n', 'arrangements to furnish money, clothing, powder, and other supplies to\\n', 'the struggling colonies, although official requests for them were\\n', 'officially refused by the French government.\\n', '\\n', '=Franklin at Paris.=--When Franklin reached Paris, he was received only\\n', \"in private by the king's minister, Vergennes. The French people,\\n\", 'however, made manifest their affection for the \"plain republican\" in\\n', '\"his full dress suit of spotted Manchester velvet.\" He was known among\\n', 'men of letters as an author, a scientist, and a philosopher of\\n', 'extraordinary ability. His \"Poor Richard\" had thrice been translated\\n', 'into French and was scattered in numerous editions throughout the\\n', 'kingdom. People of all ranks--ministers, ladies at court, philosophers,\\n', 'peasants, and stable boys--knew of Franklin and wished him success in\\n', 'his mission. The queen, Marie Antoinette, fated to lose her head in a\\n', 'revolution soon to follow, played with fire by encouraging \"our dear\\n', 'republican.\"\\n', '\\n', 'For the king of France, however, this was more serious business. England\\n', 'resented the presence of this \"traitor\" in Paris, and Louis had to be\\n', 'cautious about plunging into another war that might also end\\n', \"disastrously. Moreover, the early period of Franklin's sojourn in Paris\\n\", \"was a dark hour for the American Revolution. Washington's brilliant\\n\", 'exploit at Trenton on Christmas night, 1776, and the battle with\\n', 'Cornwallis at Princeton had been followed by the disaster at Brandywine,\\n', 'the loss of Philadelphia, the defeat at Germantown, and the retirement\\n', 'to Valley Forge for the winter of 1777-78. New York City and\\n', 'Philadelphia--two strategic ports--were in British hands; the Hudson\\n', 'and Delaware rivers were blocked; and General Burgoyne with his British\\n', 'troops was on his way down through the heart of northern New York,\\n', 'cutting New England off from the rest of the colonies. No wonder the\\n', 'king was cautious. Then the unexpected happened. Burgoyne, hemmed in\\n', 'from all sides by the American forces, his flanks harried, his foraging\\n', 'parties beaten back, his supplies cut off, surrendered on October 17,\\n', '1777, to General Gates, who had superseded General Schuyler in time to\\n', 'receive the honor.\\n', '\\n', '=Treaties of Alliance and Commerce (1778).=--News of this victory,\\n', 'placed by historians among the fifteen decisive battles of the world,\\n', 'reached Franklin one night early in December while he and some friends\\n', 'sat gloomily at dinner. Beaumarchais, who was with him, grasped at once\\n', 'the meaning of the situation and set off to the court at Versailles with\\n', 'such haste that he upset his coach and dislocated his arm. The king and\\n', 'his ministers were at last convinced that the hour had come to aid the\\n', 'Revolution. Treaties of commerce and alliance were drawn up and signed\\n', 'in February, 1778. The independence of the United States was recognized\\n', 'by France and an alliance was formed to guarantee that independence.\\n', 'Combined military action was agreed upon and Louis then formally\\n', 'declared war on England. Men who had, a few short years before, fought\\n', 'one another in the wilderness of Pennsylvania or on the Plains of\\n', 'Abraham, were now ranged side by side in a war on the Empire that Pitt\\n', '\\n', '=Spain and Holland Involved.=--Within a few months, Spain, remembering\\n', 'the steady decline of her sea power since the days of the Armada and\\n', 'hoping to drive the British out of Gibraltar, once more joined the\\n', 'concert of nations against England. Holland, a member of a league of\\n', 'armed neutrals formed in protest against British searches on the high\\n', 'seas, sent her fleet to unite with the forces of Spain, France, and\\n', 'America to prey upon British commerce. To all this trouble for England\\n', 'was added the danger of a possible revolt in Ireland, where the spirit\\n', 'of independence was flaming up.\\n', '\\n', '=The British Offer Terms to America.=--Seeing the colonists about to be\\n', 'joined by France in a common war on the English empire, Lord North\\n', 'proposed, in February, 1778, a renewal of negotiations. By solemn\\n', 'enactment, Parliament declared its intention not to exercise the right\\n', 'of imposing taxes within the colonies; at the same time it authorized\\n', 'the opening of negotiations through commissioners to be sent to America.\\n', 'suspended, and the old imperial constitution, as it stood before the\\n', 'opening of hostilities, restored to full vigor. It was too late. Events\\n', 'had taken the affairs of America out of the hands of British\\n', 'commissioners and diplomats.\\n', '\\n', '=Effects of French Aid.=--The French alliance brought ships of war,\\n', 'large sums of gold and silver, loads of supplies, and a considerable\\n', 'body of trained soldiers to the aid of the Americans. Timely as was this\\n', 'help, it meant no sudden change in the fortunes of war. The British\\n', 'evacuated Philadelphia in the summer following the alliance, and\\n', \"Washington's troops were encouraged to come out of Valley Forge. They\\n\", 'inflicted a heavy blow on the British at Monmouth, but the treasonable\\n', 'conduct of General Charles Lee prevented a triumph. The recovery of\\n', 'Philadelphia was offset by the treason of Benedict Arnold, the loss of\\n', 'Savannah and Charleston (1780), and the defeat of Gates at Camden.\\n', '\\n', 'The full effect of the French alliance was not felt until 1781, when\\n', 'Cornwallis went into Virginia and settled at Yorktown. Accompanied by\\n', 'French troops Washington swept rapidly southward and penned the British\\n', 'to the shore while a powerful French fleet shut off their escape by sea.\\n', 'It was this movement, which certainly could not have been executed\\n', 'without French aid, that put an end to all chance of restoring British\\n', 'dominion in America. It was the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown that\\n', 'caused Lord North to pace the floor and cry out: \"It is all over! It is\\n', 'all over!\" What might have been done without the French alliance lies\\n', 'hidden from mankind. What was accomplished with the help of French\\n', 'soldiers, sailors, officers, money, and supplies, is known to all the\\n', 'earth. \"All the world agree,\" exultantly wrote Franklin from Paris to\\n', 'General Washington, \"that no expedition was ever better planned or\\n', 'better executed. It brightens the glory that must accompany your name to\\n', 'the latest posterity.\" Diplomacy as well as martial valor had its\\n', 'reward.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=British Opposition to the War.=--In measuring the forces that led to\\n', 'the final discomfiture of King George and Lord North, it is necessary to\\n', 'remember that from the beginning to the end the British ministry at home\\n', 'faced a powerful, informed, and relentless opposition. There were\\n', 'vigorous protests, first against the obnoxious acts which precipitated\\n', 'the unhappy quarrel, then against the way in which the war was waged,\\n', 'and finally against the futile struggle to retain a hold upon the\\n', 'American dominions. Among the members of Parliament who thundered\\n', 'against the government were the first statesmen and orators of the land.\\n', 'William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, though he deplored the idea of American\\n', 'independence, denounced the government as the aggressor and rejoiced in\\n', 'American resistance. Edmund Burke leveled his heavy batteries against\\n', 'every measure of coercion and at last strove for a peace which, while\\n', 'giving independence to America, would work for reconciliation rather\\n', 'than estrangement. Charles James Fox gave the colonies his generous\\n', 'sympathy and warmly championed their rights. Outside of the circle of\\n', 'statesmen there were stout friends of the American cause like David\\n', 'Hume, the philosopher and historian, and Catherine Macaulay, an author\\n', 'of wide fame and a republican bold enough to encourage Washington in\\n', 'seeing it through.\\n', '\\n', 'Against this powerful opposition, the government enlisted a whole army\\n', 'of scribes and journalists to pour out criticism on the Americans and\\n', 'their friends. Dr. Samuel Johnson, whom it employed in this business,\\n', 'was so savage that even the ministers had to tone down his pamphlets\\n', 'before printing them. Far more weighty was Edward Gibbon, who was in\\n', 'time to win fame as the historian of the _Decline and Fall of the Roman\\n', 'Empire_. He had at first opposed the government; but, on being given a\\n', 'lucrative post, he used his sharp pen in its support, causing his\\n', 'friends to ridicule him in these lines:\\n', '\\n', '    \"King George, in a fright\\n', '     Lest Gibbon should write\\n', \"       The story of England's disgrace,\\n\", '     Thought no way so sure\\n', '     His pen to secure\\n', '       As to give the historian a place.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Lord North Yields.=--As time wore on, events bore heavily on the side\\n', \"of the opponents of the government's measures. They had predicted that\\n\", 'conquest was impossible, and they had urged the advantages of a peace\\n', 'which would in some measure restore the affections of the Americans.\\n', \"Every day's news confirmed their predictions and lent support to their\\n\", 'arguments. Moreover, the war, which sprang out of an effort to relieve\\n', 'English burdens, made those burdens heavier than ever. Military expenses\\n', 'were daily increasing. Trade with the colonies, the greatest single\\n', 'outlet for British goods and capital, was paralyzed. The heavy debts due\\n', 'British merchants in America were not only unpaid but postponed into an\\n', 'indefinite future. Ireland was on the verge of revolution. The French\\n', 'had a dangerous fleet on the high seas. In vain did the king assert in\\n', 'December, 1781, that no difficulties would ever make him consent to a\\n', 'peace that meant American independence. Parliament knew better, and on\\n', 'February 27, 1782, in the House of Commons was carried an address to the\\n', 'throne against continuing the war. Burke, Fox, the younger Pitt, Barre,\\n', 'and other friends of the colonies voted in the affirmative. Lord North\\n', 'gave notice then that his ministry was at an end. The king moaned:\\n', '\"Necessity made me yield.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In April, 1782, Franklin received word from the English government that\\n', 'it was prepared to enter into negotiations leading to a settlement. This\\n', 'was embarrassing. In the treaty of alliance with France, the United\\n', 'States had promised that peace should be a joint affair agreed to by\\n', 'both nations in open conference. Finding France, however, opposed to\\n', 'some of their claims respecting boundaries and fisheries, the American\\n', 'commissioners conferred with the British agents at Paris without\\n', 'consulting the French minister. They actually signed a preliminary peace\\n', 'draft before they informed him of their operations. When Vergennes\\n', 'reproached him, Franklin replied that they \"had been guilty of\\n', 'neglecting _bienseance_ [good manners] but hoped that the great work\\n', 'would not be ruined by a single indiscretion.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Terms of Peace (1783).=--The general settlement at Paris in 1783\\n', 'was a triumph for America. England recognized the independence of the\\n', 'United States, naming each state specifically, and agreed to boundaries\\n', 'extending from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and from the Great Lakes\\n', 'to the Floridas. England held Canada, Newfoundland, and the West Indies\\n', 'intact, made gains in India, and maintained her supremacy on the seas.\\n', 'Spain won Florida and Minorca but not the coveted Gibraltar. France\\n', 'gained nothing important save the satisfaction of seeing England humbled\\n', 'and the colonies independent.\\n', '\\n', 'The generous terms secured by the American commission at Paris called\\n', 'forth surprise and gratitude in the United States and smoothed the way\\n', 'for a renewal of commercial relations with the mother country. At the\\n', 'same time they gave genuine anxiety to European diplomats. \"This federal\\n', 'republic is born a pigmy,\" wrote the Spanish ambassador to his royal\\n', 'formidable to these countries. Liberty of conscience and the facility\\n', 'for establishing a new population on immense lands, as well as the\\n', 'advantages of the new government, will draw thither farmers and artisans\\n', 'from all the nations. In a few years we shall watch with grief the\\n', 'tyrannical existence of the same colossus.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The independence of the American colonies was foreseen by many European\\n', 'statesmen as they watched the growth of their population, wealth, and\\n', 'power; but no one could fix the hour of the great event. Until 1763 the\\n', 'American colonists lived fairly happily under British dominion. There\\n', 'were collisions from time to time, of course. Royal governors clashed\\n', 'with stiff-necked colonial legislatures. There were protests against the\\n', \"exercise of the king's veto power in specific cases. Nevertheless, on\\n\", 'the whole, the relations between America and the mother country were\\n', 'more amicable in 1763 than at any period under the Stuart regime which\\n', 'closed in 1688.\\n', '\\n', 'The crash, when it came, was not deliberately willed by any one. It was\\n', 'the product of a number of forces that happened to converge about 1763.\\n', 'proud, inexperienced, and stubborn king. For nearly fifty years his\\n', 'predecessors, Germans as they were in language and interest, had allowed\\n', 'be king in fact as well as in name. About the same time England brought\\n', 'to a close the long and costly French and Indian War and was staggering\\n', 'under a heavy burden of debt and taxes. The war had been fought partly\\n', 'in defense of the American colonies and nothing seemed more reasonable\\n', 'to English statesmen than the idea that the colonies should bear part of\\n', 'the cost of their own defense. At this juncture there came into\\n', 'prominence, in royal councils, two men bent on taxing America and\\n', 'controlling her trade, Grenville and Townshend. The king was willing,\\n', 'the English taxpayers were thankful for any promise of relief, and\\n', 'statesmen were found to undertake the experiment. England therefore set\\n', 'out upon a new course. She imposed taxes upon the colonists, regulated\\n', 'their trade and set royal officers upon them to enforce the law. This\\n', 'action evoked protests from the colonists. They held a Stamp Act\\n', 'Congress to declare their rights and petition for a redress of\\n', 'grievances. Some of the more restless spirits rioted in the streets,\\n', \"sacked the houses of the king's officers, and tore up the stamped paper.\\n\", '\\n', 'Frightened by uprising, the English government drew back and repealed\\n', 'the Stamp Act. Then it veered again and renewed its policy of\\n', 'interference. Interference again called forth American protests.\\n', 'Protests aroused sharper retaliation. More British regulars were sent\\n', 'over to keep order. More irritating laws were passed by Parliament.\\n', 'Rioting again appeared: tea was dumped in the harbor of Boston and\\n', 'seized in the harbor of Charleston. The British answer was more force.\\n', 'The response of the colonists was a Continental Congress for defense. An\\n', 'unexpected and unintended clash of arms at Lexington and Concord in the\\n', 'spring of 1775 brought forth from the king of England a proclamation:\\n', '\"The Americans are rebels!\"\\n', '\\n', 'The die was cast. The American Revolution had begun. Washington was made\\n', 'commander-in-chief. Armies were raised, money was borrowed, a huge\\n', 'volume of paper currency was issued, and foreign aid was summoned.\\n', 'Franklin plied his diplomatic arts at Paris until in 1778 he induced\\n', 'France to throw her sword into the balance. Three years later,\\n', 'Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. In 1783, by the formal treaty of\\n', 'The new nation, endowed with an imperial domain stretching from the\\n', 'Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River, began its career among the\\n', 'sovereign powers of the earth.\\n', '\\n', 'In the sphere of civil government, the results of the Revolution were\\n', 'equally remarkable. Royal officers and royal authorities were driven\\n', 'from the former dominions. All power was declared to be in the people.\\n', 'All the colonies became states, each with its own constitution or plan\\n', 'of government.

The\\n', 'majority of the patriots whose labors and sacrifices had made this\\n', 'possible naturally looked upon their work and pronounced it good. Those\\n', 'Americans, however, who peered beneath the surface of things, saw that\\n', 'the Declaration of Independence, even if splendidly phrased, and paper\\n', 'constitutions, drawn by finest enthusiasm \"uninstructed by experience,\"\\n', 'could not alone make the republic great and prosperous or even free. All\\n', 'around them they saw chaos in finance and in industry and perils for the\\n', 'immediate future.\\n', '\\n', '=The Weakness of the Articles of Confederation.=--The government under\\n', 'the Articles of Confederation had neither the strength nor the resources\\n', 'necessary to cope with the problems of reconstruction left by the war.\\n', 'The sole organ of government was a Congress composed of from two to\\n', 'seven members from each state chosen as the legislature might direct and\\n', 'paid by the state. In determining all questions, each state had one\\n', 'vote--Delaware thus enjoying the same weight as Virginia. There was no\\n', 'president to enforce the laws. Congress was given power to select a\\n', 'committee of thirteen--one from each state--to act as an executive body\\n', 'when it was not in session; but this device, on being tried out, proved\\n', 'a failure. There was no system of national courts to which citizens and\\n', 'states could appeal for the protection of their rights or through which\\n', 'they could compel obedience to law. The two great powers of government,\\n', 'military and financial, were withheld. Congress, it is true, could\\n', 'authorize expenditures but had to rely upon the states for the payment\\n', 'of contributions to meet its bills. It could also order the\\n', 'establishment of an army, but it could only request the states to supply\\n', 'their respective quotas of soldiers. It could not lay taxes nor bring\\n', 'any pressure to bear upon a single citizen in the whole country. It\\n', 'could act only through the medium of the state governments.\\n', '\\n', '=Financial and Commercial Disorders.=--In the field of public finance,\\n', 'the disorders were pronounced. The huge debt incurred during the war was\\n', 'still outstanding. Congress was unable to pay either the interest or the\\n', 'principal. Public creditors were in despair, as the market value of\\n', 'their bonds sank to twenty-five or even ten cents on the dollar. The\\n', 'current bills of Congress were unpaid. As some one complained, there was\\n', 'not enough money in the treasury to buy pen and ink with which to record\\n', 'the transactions of the shadow legislature. The currency was in utter\\n', 'chaos. Millions of dollars in notes issued by Congress had become mere\\n', 'trash worth a cent or two on the dollar. There was no other expression\\n', 'of contempt so forceful as the popular saying: \"not worth a\\n', 'Continental.\" To make matters worse, several of the states were pouring\\n', 'new streams of paper money from the press. Almost the only good money in\\n', 'circulation consisted of English, French, and Spanish coins, and the\\n', 'public was even defrauded by them because money changers were busy\\n', 'clipping and filing away the metal. Foreign commerce was unsettled. The\\n', 'entire British system of trade discrimination was turned against the\\n', 'Americans, and Congress, having no power to regulate foreign commerce,\\n', 'was unable to retaliate or to negotiate treaties which it could enforce.\\n', 'Domestic commerce was impeded by the jealousies of the states, which\\n', 'erected tariff barriers against their neighbors. The condition of the\\n', 'currency made the exchange of money and goods extremely difficult, and,\\n', 'as if to increase the confusion, backward states enacted laws hindering\\n', 'the prompt collection of debts within their borders--an evil which\\n', 'nothing but a national system of courts could cure.\\n', '\\n', '=Congress in Disrepute.=--With treaties set at naught by the states, the\\n', 'laws unenforced, the treasury empty, and the public credit gone, the\\n', 'Congress of the United States fell into utter disrepute. It called upon\\n', 'the states to pay their quotas of money into the treasury, only to be\\n', 'treated with contempt. Even its own members looked upon it as a solemn\\n', 'futility. Some of the ablest men refused to accept election to it, and\\n', 'many who did take the doubtful honor failed to attend the sessions.\\n', 'Again and again it was impossible to secure a quorum for the transaction\\n', 'of business.\\n', '\\n', '=Troubles of the State Governments.=--The state governments, free to\\n', 'pursue their own course with no interference from without, had almost as\\n', 'many difficulties as the Congress. They too were loaded with\\n', 'revolutionary debts calling for heavy taxes upon an already restive\\n', 'population. Oppressed by their financial burdens and discouraged by the\\n', 'fall in prices which followed the return of peace, the farmers of\\n', 'several states joined in a concerted effort and compelled their\\n', 'legislatures to issue large sums of paper money. The currency fell in\\n', 'value, but nevertheless it was forced on unwilling creditors to square\\n', 'old accounts.\\n', '\\n', 'In every part of the country legislative action fluctuated violently.\\n', 'Laws were made one year only to be repealed the next and reenacted the\\n', 'third year. Lands were sold by one legislature and the sales were\\n', 'canceled by its successor. Uncertainty and distrust were the natural\\n', 'consequences. Men of substance longed for some power that would forbid\\n', 'states to issue bills of credit, to make paper money legal tender in\\n', 'payment of debts, or to impair the obligation of contracts. Men heavily\\n', 'in debt, on the other hand, urged even more drastic action against\\n', 'creditors.\\n', '\\n', 'So great did the discontent of the farmers in New Hampshire become in\\n', '1786 that a mob surrounded the legislature, demanding a repeal of the\\n', 'taxes and the issuance of paper money. It was with difficulty that an\\n', 'armed rebellion was avoided. In Massachusetts the malcontents, under the\\n', 'leadership of Daniel Shays, a captain in the Revolutionary army,\\n', 'organized that same year open resistance to the government of the state.\\n', 'Shays and his followers protested against the conduct of creditors in\\n', 'foreclosing mortgages upon the debt-burdened farmers, against the\\n', 'lawyers for increasing the costs of legal proceedings, against the\\n', 'senate of the state the members of which were apportioned among the\\n', 'towns on the basis of the amount of taxes paid, against heavy taxes, and\\n', 'against the refusal of the legislature to issue paper money. They seized\\n', 'the towns of Worcester and Springfield and broke up the courts of\\n', 'justice. All through the western part of the state the revolt spread,\\n', 'sending a shock of alarm to every center and section of the young\\n', 'republic. Only by the most vigorous action was Governor Bowdoin able to\\n', 'quell the uprising; and when that task was accomplished, the state\\n', 'government did not dare to execute any of the prisoners because they had\\n', 'so many sympathizers. Moreover, Bowdoin and several members of the\\n', 'legislature who had been most zealous in their attacks on the insurgents\\n', 'were defeated at the ensuing election. The need of national assistance\\n', 'for state governments in times of domestic violence was everywhere\\n', 'emphasized by men who were opposed to revolutionary acts.\\n', '\\n', '=Alarm over Dangers to the Republic.=--Leading American citizens,\\n', 'watching the drift of affairs, were slowly driven to the conclusion that\\n', 'the new ship of state so proudly launched a few years before was\\n', 'careening into anarchy. \"The facts of our peace and independence,\" wrote\\n', 'a friend of Washington, \"do not at present wear so promising an\\n', 'jealousies, and turbulence of the people at times almost stagger my\\n', 'confidence in our political establishments; and almost occasion me to\\n', 'think that they will show themselves unworthy of the noble prize for\\n', 'which we have contended.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Washington himself was profoundly discouraged. On hearing of Shays's\\n\", 'rebellion, he exclaimed: \"What, gracious God, is man that there should\\n', 'be such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his conduct! It is but the\\n', 'other day that we were shedding our blood to obtain the constitutions\\n', 'under which we now live--constitutions of our own choice and making--and\\n', 'now we are unsheathing our sword to overturn them.\" The same year he\\n', 'told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical government\\n', 'without horror. From thinking proceeds speaking. Hence to acting is\\n', 'often but a single step. But how irresistible and tremendous! What a\\n', 'triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions! What a triumph for\\n', 'the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing\\n', 'ourselves!\"\\n', '\\n', '=Congress Attempts Some Reforms.=--The Congress was not indifferent to\\n', 'the events that disturbed Washington. On the contrary it put forth many\\n', 'efforts to check tendencies so dangerous to finance, commerce,\\n', 'industries, and the Confederation itself. In 1781, even before the\\n', 'treaty of peace was signed, the Congress, having found out how futile\\n', 'were its taxing powers, carried a resolution of amendment to the\\n', 'Articles of Confederation, authorizing the levy of a moderate duty on\\n', 'imports. Yet this mild measure was rejected by the states. Two years\\n', 'later the Congress prepared another amendment sanctioning the levy of\\n', 'duties on imports, to be collected this time by state officers and\\n', 'applied to the payment of the public debt. This more limited proposal,\\n', 'designed to save public credit, likewise failed. In 1786, the Congress\\n', 'made a third appeal to the states for help, declaring that they had been\\n', 'so irregular and so negligent in paying their quotas that further\\n', 'reliance upon that mode of raising revenues was dishonorable and\\n', 'dangerous.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Hamilton and Washington Urge Reform.=--The attempts at reform by the\\n', 'Congress were accompanied by demand for, both within and without that\\n', 'body, a convention to frame a new plan of government. In 1780, the\\n', 'youthful Alexander Hamilton, realizing the weakness of the Articles, so\\n', 'widely discussed, proposed a general convention for the purpose of\\n', 'drafting a new constitution on entirely different principles. With\\n', 'tireless energy he strove to bring his countrymen to his view.\\n', 'Washington, agreeing with him on every point, declared, in a circular\\n', 'letter to the governors, that the duration of the union would be short\\n', 'unless there was lodged somewhere a supreme power \"to regulate and\\n', 'govern the general concerns of the confederated republic.\" The governor\\n', 'of Massachusetts, disturbed by the growth of discontent all about him,\\n', 'suggested to the state legislature in 1785 the advisability of a\\n', 'national convention to enlarge the powers of the Congress. The\\n', 'legislature approved the plan, but did not press it to a conclusion.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Annapolis Convention.=--Action finally came from the South. The\\n', 'Virginia legislature, taking things into its own hands, called a\\n', 'conference of delegates at Annapolis to consider matters of taxation and\\n', 'commerce. When the convention assembled in 1786, it was found that only\\n', 'five states had taken the trouble to send representatives. The leaders\\n', 'were deeply discouraged, but the resourceful Hamilton, a delegate from\\n', 'New York, turned the affair to good account. He secured the adoption of\\n', 'a resolution, calling upon the Congress itself to summon another\\n', 'convention, to meet at Philadelphia.\\n', '\\n', 'at last decided in February, 1787, to issue the call. Fearing drastic\\n', 'changes, however, it restricted the convention to \"the sole and express\\n', 'purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.\" Jealous of its own\\n', 'powers, it added that any alterations proposed should be referred to the\\n', 'Congress and the states for their approval.\\n', '\\n', 'Every state in the union, except Rhode Island, responded to this call.\\n', 'Indeed some of the states, having the Annapolis resolution before them,\\n', 'had already anticipated the Congress by selecting delegates before the\\n', 'formal summons came. Thus, by the persistence of governors,\\n', 'legislatures, and private citizens, there was brought about the\\n', 'long-desired national convention. In May, 1787, it assembled in\\n', 'Philadelphia.\\n', '\\n', '=The Eminent Men of the Convention.=--On the roll of that memorable\\n', 'convention were fifty-five men, at least half of whom were acknowledged\\n', 'to be among the foremost statesmen and thinkers in America. Every field\\n', 'of statecraft was represented by them: war and practical management in\\n', 'Washington, who was chosen president of the convention; diplomacy in\\n', 'Franklin, now old and full of honor in his own land as well as abroad;\\n', 'finance in Alexander Hamilton and Robert Morris; law in James Wilson of\\n', 'Pennsylvania; the philosophy of government in James Madison, called the\\n', '\"father of the Constitution.\" They were not theorists but practical men,\\n', 'rich in political experience and endowed with deep insight into the\\n', 'springs of human action. Three of them had served in the Stamp Act\\n', 'Congress: Dickinson of Delaware, William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut,\\n', 'and John Rutledge of South Carolina. Eight had been signers of the\\n', 'Declaration of Independence: Read of Delaware, Sherman of Connecticut,\\n', 'Wythe of Virginia, Gerry of Massachusetts, Franklin, Robert Morris,\\n', 'George Clymer, and James Wilson of Pennsylvania. All but twelve had at\\n', 'some time served in the Continental Congress and eighteen were members\\n', 'of that body in the spring of 1787. Washington, Hamilton, Mifflin, and\\n', 'Charles Pinckney had been officers in the Revolutionary army. Seven of\\n', 'the delegates had gained political experience as governors of states.\\n', '\"The convention as a whole,\" according to the historian Hildreth,\\n', '\"represented in a marked manner the talent, intelligence, and\\n', 'especially the conservative sentiment of the country.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Problems Involved.=--The great problems before the convention were nine\\n', 'in number: (1) Shall the Articles of Confederation be revised or a new\\n', 'system of government constructed? (2) Shall the government be founded on\\n', 'states equal in power as under the Articles or on the broader and deeper\\n', 'the election of national officers? (4) What shall be the qualifications\\n', 'for the suffrage? (5) How shall the conflicting interests of the\\n', 'commercial and the planting states be balanced so as to safeguard the\\n', 'essential rights of each? (6) What shall be the form of the new\\n', 'government? (7) What powers shall be conferred on it? (8) How shall the\\n', 'state legislatures be restrained from their attacks on property rights\\n', 'such as the issuance of paper money? (9) Shall the approval of all the\\n', 'states be necessary, as under the Articles, for the adoption and\\n', 'amendment of the Constitution?\\n', '\\n', '=Revision of the Articles or a New Government?=--The moment the first\\n', 'problem was raised, representatives of the small states, led by William\\n', 'Paterson of New Jersey, were on their feet. They feared that, if the\\n', 'Articles were overthrown, the equality and rights of the states would be\\n', 'put in jeopardy. Their protest was therefore vigorous. They cited the\\n', 'call issued by the Congress in summoning the convention which\\n', 'specifically stated that they were assembled for \"the sole and express\\n', 'purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.\" They cited also\\n', 'their instructions from their state legislatures, which authorized them\\n', 'to \"revise and amend\" the existing scheme of government, not to make a\\n', 'revolution in it. To depart from the authorization laid down by the\\n', 'Congress and the legislatures would be to exceed their powers, they\\n', 'argued, and to betray the trust reposed in them by their countrymen.\\n', '\\n', 'To their contentions, Randolph of Virginia replied: \"When the salvation\\n', 'of the republic is at stake, it would be treason to our trust not to\\n', 'propose what we find necessary.\" Hamilton, reminding the delegates that\\n', 'their work was still subject to the approval of the states, frankly said\\n', 'that on the point of their powers he had no scruples. With the issue\\n', 'clear, the convention cast aside the Articles as if they did not exist\\n', 'and proceeded to the work of drawing up a new constitution, \"laying its\\n', 'foundations on such principles and organizing its powers in such form\"\\n', 'as to the delegates seemed \"most likely to affect their safety and\\n', 'happiness.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Compromise.=--Defeated in their attempt to limit the convention to a\\n', 'mere revision of the Articles, the spokesmen of the smaller states\\n', 'redoubled their efforts to preserve the equality of the states. The\\n', 'signal for a radical departure from the Articles on this point was given\\n', 'early in the sessions when Randolph presented \"the Virginia plan.\" He\\n', 'proposed that the new national legislature consist of two houses, the\\n', 'members of which were to be apportioned among the states according to\\n', 'their wealth or free white population, as the convention might decide.\\n', 'This plan was vehemently challenged. Paterson of New Jersey flatly\\n', 'avowed that neither he nor his state would ever bow to such tyranny. As\\n', 'an alternative, he presented \"the New Jersey plan\" calling for a\\n', 'national legislature of one house representing states as such, not\\n', 'wealth or people--a legislature in which all states, large or small,\\n', 'would have equal voice. Wilson of Pennsylvania, on behalf of the more\\n', 'populous states, took up the gauntlet which Paterson had thrown down. It\\n', 'was absurd, he urged, for 180,000 men in one state to have the same\\n', 'weight in national counsels as 750,000 men in another state. \"The\\n', 'gentleman from New Jersey,\" he said, \"is candid. He declares his opinion\\n', 'principles.\" So the bitter controversy ran on through many exciting\\n', 'sessions.\\n', '\\n', 'Greek had met Greek. The convention was hopelessly deadlocked and on the\\n', 'verge of dissolution, \"scarce held together by the strength of a hair,\"\\n', 'compromise. Instead of a Congress of one house as provided by the\\n', 'Articles, the convention agreed upon a legislature of two houses. In the\\n', 'Senate, the aspirations of the small states were to be satisfied, for\\n', 'each state was given two members in that body. In the formation of the\\n', 'House of Representatives, the larger states were placated, for it was\\n', 'agreed that the members of that chamber were to be apportioned among the\\n', 'states on the basis of population, counting three-fifths of the slaves.\\n', '\\n', '=The Question of Popular Election.=--The method of selecting federal\\n', 'officers and members of Congress also produced an acrimonious debate\\n', 'which revealed how deep-seated was the distrust of the capacity of the\\n', 'people to govern themselves. Few there were who believed that no branch\\n', 'of the government should be elected directly by the voters; still fewer\\n', 'were there, however, who desired to see all branches so chosen. One or\\n', 'two even expressed a desire for a monarchy. The dangers of democracy\\n', 'were stressed by Gerry of Massachusetts: \"All the evils we experience\\n', 'flow from an excess of democracy. The people do not want virtue but are\\n', 'heretofore but have been taught by experience the danger of a leveling\\n', 'spirit.\" To the \"democratic licentiousness of the state legislatures,\"\\n', 'Randolph sought to oppose a \"firm senate.\" To check the excesses of\\n', 'popular government Charles Pinckney of South Carolina declared that no\\n', 'one should be elected President who was not worth $100,000 and that high\\n', 'property qualifications should be placed on members of Congress and\\n', 'judges. Other members of the convention were stoutly opposed to such\\n', '\"high-toned notions of government.\" Franklin and Wilson, both from\\n', 'Pennsylvania, vigorously championed popular election; while men like\\n', 'Madison insisted that at least one part of the government should rest on\\n', 'the broad foundation of the people.\\n', '\\n', 'Out of this clash of opinion also came compromise. One branch, the House\\n', 'of Representatives, it was agreed, was to be elected directly by the\\n', 'voters, while the Senators were to be elected indirectly by the state\\n', 'legislatures. The President was to be chosen by electors selected as the\\n', 'legislatures of the states might determine, and the judges of the\\n', 'federal courts, supreme and inferior, by the President and the Senate.\\n', '\\n', '=The Question of the Suffrage.=--The battle over the suffrage was sharp\\n', 'but brief. Gouverneur Morris proposed that only land owners should be\\n', 'permitted to vote. Madison replied that the state legislatures, which\\n', 'had made so much trouble with radical laws, were elected by freeholders.\\n', 'After the debate, the delegates, unable to agree on any property\\n', 'limitations on the suffrage, decided that the House of Representatives\\n', 'should be elected by voters having the \"qualifications requisite for\\n', 'electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature.\" Thus\\n', 'they accepted the suffrage provisions of the states.\\n', '\\n', '=The Balance between the Planting and the Commercial States.=--After the\\n', 'debates had gone on for a few weeks, Madison came to the conclusion that\\n', 'the real division in the convention was not between the large and the\\n', 'small states but between the planting section founded on slave labor and\\n', 'the commercial North. Thus he anticipated by nearly three-quarters of a\\n', 'century \"the irrepressible conflict.\" The planting states had neither\\n', 'the free white population nor the wealth of the North. There were,\\n', 'counting Delaware, six of them as against seven commercial states.\\n', 'Dependent for their prosperity mainly upon the sale of tobacco, rice,\\n', 'and other staples abroad, they feared that Congress might impose\\n', 'restraints upon their enterprise. Being weaker in numbers, they were\\n', 'afraid that the majority might lay an unfair burden of taxes upon them.\\n', '\\n', 'were therefore very anxious to secure for their section the largest\\n', 'possible representation in Congress, and at the same time to restrain\\n', 'the taxing power of that body. Two devices were thought adapted to these\\n', 'ends. One was to count the slaves as people when apportioning\\n', 'representatives among the states according to their respective\\n', 'populations; the other was to provide that direct taxes should be\\n', 'apportioned among the states, in proportion not to their wealth but to\\n', 'the number of their free white inhabitants. For obvious reasons the\\n', 'Northern delegates objected to these proposals. Once more a compromise\\n', 'proved to be the solution. It was agreed that not all the slaves but\\n', 'three-fifths of them should be counted for both purposes--representation\\n', 'and direct taxation.\\n', '\\n', 'in the project to confer upon Congress the power to regulate interstate\\n', 'and foreign commerce. To the manufacturing and trading states this was\\n', 'essential. It would prevent interstate tariffs and trade jealousies; it\\n', 'would enable Congress to protect American manufactures and to break\\n', 'down, by appropriate retaliations, foreign discriminations against\\n', 'American commerce. To the South the proposal was menacing because\\n', 'tariffs might interfere with the free exchange of the produce of\\n', 'plantations in European markets, and navigation acts might confine the\\n', 'carrying trade to American, that is Northern, ships. The importation of\\n', 'slaves, moreover, it was feared might be heavily taxed or immediately\\n', 'prohibited altogether.\\n', '\\n', 'The result of this and related controversies was a debate on the merits\\n', 'of slavery. Gouverneur Morris delivered his mind and heart on that\\n', 'subject, denouncing slavery as a nefarious institution and the curse of\\n', 'heaven on the states in which it prevailed. Mason of Virginia, a\\n', 'slaveholder himself, was hardly less outspoken, saying: \"Slavery\\n', 'discourages arts and manufactures. The poor despise labor when performed\\n', 'by slaves. They prevent the migration of whites who really strengthen\\n', 'and enrich a country.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The system, however, had its defenders. Representatives from South\\n', 'Carolina argued that their entire economic life rested on slave labor\\n', 'and that the high death rate in the rice swamps made continuous\\n', 'importation necessary. Ellsworth of Connecticut took the ground that\\n', 'the convention should not meddle with slavery. \"The morality or wisdom\\n', 'of slavery,\" he said, \"are considerations belonging to the states. What\\n', 'enriches a part enriches the whole.\" To the future he turned an\\n', 'untroubled face: \"As population increases, poor laborers will be so\\n', 'plenty as to render slaves useless. Slavery in time will not be a speck\\n', 'in our country.\" Virginia and North Carolina, already overstocked with\\n', 'slaves, favored prohibiting the traffic in them; but South Carolina was\\n', 'adamant. She must have fresh supplies of slaves or she would not\\n', 'federate.\\n', '\\n', 'So it was agreed that, while Congress might regulate foreign trade by\\n', 'majority vote, the importation of slaves should not be forbidden before\\n', 'the lapse of twenty years, and that any import tax should not exceed $10\\n', 'a head. At the same time, in connection with the regulation of foreign\\n', 'trade, it was stipulated that a two-thirds vote in the Senate should be\\n', 'South was made in the provision for the return of runaway slaves--a\\n', 'provision also useful in the North, where indentured servants were about\\n', 'as troublesome as slaves in escaping from their masters.\\n', '\\n', '=The Form of the Government.=--As to the details of the frame of\\n', 'government and the grand principles involved, the opinion of the\\n', 'convention ebbed and flowed, decisions being taken in the heat of\\n', 'debate, only to be revoked and taken again.\\n', '\\n', 'executive branch; for reliance upon Congress to enforce its own laws and\\n', 'treaties had been a broken reed. On the character and functions of the\\n', 'executive, however, there were many views. The New Jersey plan called\\n', 'for a council selected by the Congress; the Virginia plan provided that\\n', 'the executive branch should be chosen by the Congress but did not state\\n', 'whether it should be composed of one or several persons. On this matter\\n', 'the convention voted first one way and then another; finally it agreed\\n', 'on a single executive chosen indirectly by electors selected as the\\n', 'state legislatures might decide, serving for four years, subject to\\n', 'impeachment, and endowed with regal powers in the command of the army\\n', 'and the navy and in the enforcement of the laws.\\n', '\\n', 'great compromise between the large and small commonwealths by giving\\n', 'representation to states in the Senate and to population in the House,\\n', 'the question of methods of election had to be decided. As to the House\\n', 'of Representatives it was readily agreed that the members should be\\n', 'elected by direct popular vote. There was also easy agreement on the\\n', 'proposition that a strong Senate was needed to check the \"turbulence\" of\\n', 'the lower house. Four devices were finally selected to accomplish this\\n', 'purpose. In the first place, the Senators were not to be chosen directly\\n', 'by the voters but by the legislatures of the states, thus removing their\\n', 'election one degree from the populace. In the second place, their term\\n', 'was fixed at six years instead of two, as in the case of the House. In\\n', 'the third place, provision was made for continuity by having only\\n', 'one-third of the members go out at a time while two-thirds remained in\\n', 'service. Finally, it was provided that Senators must be at least thirty\\n', 'years old while Representatives need be only twenty-five.\\n', '\\n', 'hardly open to debate. The feebleness of the Articles of Confederation\\n', 'was, in a large measure, attributed to the want of a judiciary to hold\\n', 'states and individuals in obedience to the laws and treaties of the\\n', \"union. Nevertheless on this point the advocates of states' rights were\\n\", 'extremely sensitive. They looked with distrust upon judges appointed at\\n', 'the national capital and emancipated from local interests and\\n', 'traditions; they remembered with what insistence they had claimed\\n', 'against Britain the right of local trial by jury and with what\\n', 'consternation they had viewed the proposal to make colonial judges\\n', 'independent of the assemblies in the matter of their salaries.\\n', 'Reluctantly they yielded to the demand for federal courts, consenting at\\n', 'first only to a supreme court to review cases heard in lower state\\n', 'courts and finally to such additional inferior courts as Congress might\\n', 'deem necessary.\\n', '\\n', 'framers of the Constitution, in shaping the form of government, arranged\\n', 'for a distribution of power among three branches, executive,\\n', 'legislative, and judicial. Strictly speaking we might say four branches,\\n', 'for the legislature, or Congress, was composed of two houses, elected in\\n', 'different ways, and one of them, the Senate, was made a check on the\\n', 'President through its power of ratifying treaties and appointments. \"The\\n', 'accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judicial, in the\\n', 'same hands,\" wrote Madison, \"whether of one, a few, or many, and whether\\n', 'hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the\\n', 'very definition of tyranny.\" The devices which the convention adopted to\\n', 'prevent such a centralization of authority were exceedingly ingenious\\n', 'and well calculated to accomplish the purposes of the authors.\\n', '\\n', 'The legislature consisted of two houses, the members of which were to be\\n', 'apportioned on a different basis, elected in different ways, and to\\n', 'President elected in a manner not employed in the choice of either\\n', 'branch of the legislature, serving for four years, and subject to\\n', 'removal only by the difficult process of impeachment. After a law had\\n', 'run the gantlet of both houses and the executive, it was subject to\\n', 'interpretation and annulment by the judiciary, appointed by the\\n', 'President with the consent of the Senate and serving for life. Thus it\\n', 'was made almost impossible for any political party to get possession of\\n', 'all branches of the government at a single popular election. As Hamilton\\n', 'remarked, the friends of good government considered \"every institution\\n', 'calculated to restrain the excess of law making and to keep things in\\n', 'the same state in which they happen to be at any given period as more\\n', 'likely to do good than harm.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Powers of the Federal Government.=--On the question of the powers\\n', 'to be conferred upon the new government there was less occasion for a\\n', 'serious dispute. Even the delegates from the small states agreed with\\n', 'those from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia that new powers\\n', 'should be added to those intrusted to Congress by the Articles of\\n', 'Confederation. The New Jersey plan as well as the Virginia plan\\n', 'recognized this fact. Some of the delegates, like Hamilton and Madison,\\n', 'even proposed to give Congress a general legislative authority covering\\n', 'all national matters; but others, frightened by the specter of\\n', 'nationalism, insisted on specifying each power to be conferred and\\n', 'finally carried the day.\\n', '\\n', 'the proposition that revenue must be provided to pay current expenses\\n', 'and discharge the public debt. When once the dispute over the\\n', 'apportionment of direct taxes among the slave states was settled, it was\\n', 'an easy matter to decide that Congress should have power to lay and\\n', 'collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises. In this way the national\\n', 'government was freed from dependence upon stubborn and tardy\\n', 'legislatures and enabled to collect funds directly from citizens. There\\n', 'were likewise none bold enough to contend that the anarchy of state\\n', 'tariffs and trade discriminations should be longer endured. When the\\n', 'fears of the planting states were allayed and the \"bargain\" over the\\n', 'importation of slaves was reached, the convention vested in Congress the\\n', 'power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce.\\n', '\\n', 'though the fear of huge military establishments was equally present. The\\n', 'old practice of relying on quotas furnished by the state legislatures\\n', 'was completely discredited. As in the case of taxes a direct authority\\n', 'over citizens was demanded. Congress was therefore given full power to\\n', 'raise and support armies and a navy. It could employ the state militia\\n', 'when desirable; but it could at the same time maintain a regular army\\n', 'and call directly upon all able-bodied males if the nature of a crisis\\n', 'was thought to require it.\\n', '\\n', 'Congress by the Constitution, the advocates of a strong national\\n', 'government added a general clause authorizing it to make all laws\\n', '\"necessary and proper\" for carrying into effect any and all of the\\n', 'enumerated powers. This clause, interpreted by that master mind, Chief\\n', 'Justice Marshall, was later construed to confer powers as wide as the\\n', 'requirements of a vast country spanning a continent and taking its place\\n', 'among the mighty nations of the earth.\\n', '\\n', '=Restraints on the States.=--Framing a government and endowing it with\\n', 'large powers were by no means the sole concern of the convention. Its\\n', 'very existence had been due quite as much to the conduct of the state\\n', 'legislatures as to the futilities of a paralyzed Continental Congress.\\n', 'In every state, explains Marshall in his _Life of Washington_, there was\\n', 'a party of men who had \"marked out for themselves a more indulgent\\n', 'course. Viewing with extreme tenderness the case of the debtor, their\\n', 'efforts were unceasingly directed to his relief. To exact a faithful\\n', 'compliance with contracts was, in their opinion, a harsh measure which\\n', 'the people could not bear. They were uniformly in favor of relaxing the\\n', 'administration of justice, of affording facilities for the payment of\\n', 'debts, or of suspending their collection, and remitting taxes.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The legislatures under the dominance of these men had enacted paper\\n', 'money laws enabling debtors to discharge their obligations more easily.\\n', 'The convention put an end to such practices by providing that no state\\n', 'should emit bills of credit or make anything but gold or silver legal\\n', 'tender in the payment of debts. The state legislatures had enacted laws\\n', 'allowing men to pay their debts by turning over to creditors land or\\n', 'personal property; they had repealed the charter of an endowed college\\n', 'and taken the management from the hands of the lawful trustees; and they\\n', 'had otherwise interfered with the enforcement of private agreements. The\\n', 'convention, taking notice of such matters, inserted a clause forbidding\\n', 'states \"to impair the obligation of contracts.\" The more venturous of\\n', 'the radicals had in Massachusetts raised the standard of revolt against\\n', 'the authorities of the state. The convention answered by a brief\\n', 'sentence to the effect that the President of the United States, to be\\n', 'equipped with a regular army, would send troops to suppress domestic\\n', 'insurrections whenever called upon by the legislature or, if it was not\\n', 'in session, by the governor of the state. To make sure that the\\n', 'restrictions on the states would not be dead letters, the federal\\n', 'Constitution, laws, and treaties were made the supreme law of the land,\\n', 'to be enforced whenever necessary by a national judiciary and executive\\n', 'against violations on the part of any state authorities.\\n', '\\n', '=Provisions for Ratification and Amendment.=--When the frame of\\n', 'government had been determined, the powers to be vested in it had been\\n', 'enumerated, and the restrictions upon the states had been written into\\n', 'the bond, there remained three final questions. How shall the\\n', 'Constitution be ratified? What number of states shall be necessary to\\n', 'put it into effect? How shall it be amended in the future?\\n', '\\n', 'On the first point, the mandate under which the convention was sitting\\n', 'seemed positive. The Articles of Confederation were still in effect.\\n', 'They provided that amendments could be made only by unanimous adoption\\n', 'in Congress and the approval of all the states. As if to give force to\\n', 'this provision of law, the call for the convention had expressly stated\\n', 'that all alterations and revisions should be reported to Congress for\\n', 'adoption or rejection, Congress itself to transmit the document\\n', 'thereafter to the states for their review.\\n', '\\n', 'To have observed the strict letter of the law would have defeated the\\n', 'purposes of the delegates, because Congress and the state legislatures\\n', 'were openly hostile to such drastic changes as had been made. Unanimous\\n', 'ratification, as events proved, would have been impossible. Therefore\\n', 'the delegates decided that the Constitution should be sent to Congress\\n', 'with the recommendation that it, in turn, transmit the document, not to\\n', 'the state legislatures, but to conventions held in the states for the\\n', 'special object of deciding upon ratification. This process was followed.\\n', 'It was their belief that special conventions would be more friendly than\\n', 'the state legislatures.\\n', '\\n', 'The convention was equally positive in dealing with the problem of the\\n', 'number of states necessary to establish the new Constitution. Attempts\\n', 'to change the Articles had failed because amendment required the\\n', 'approval of every state and there was always at least one recalcitrant\\n', 'member of the union. The opposition to a new Constitution was\\n', 'undoubtedly formidable. Rhode Island had even refused to take part in\\n', 'framing it, and her hostility was deep and open. So the convention cast\\n', 'aside the provision of the Articles of Confederation which required\\n', 'unanimous approval for any change in the plan of government; it decreed\\n', 'that the new Constitution should go into effect when ratified by nine\\n', 'states.\\n', '\\n', 'In providing for future changes in the Constitution itself the\\n', 'convention also thrust aside the old rule of unanimous approval, and\\n', 'decided that an amendment could be made on a two-thirds vote in both\\n', 'houses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states. This\\n', 'change was of profound significance. Every state agreed to be bound in\\n', 'the future by amendments duly adopted even in case it did not approve\\n', 'them itself. America in this way set out upon the high road that led\\n', 'from a league of states to a nation.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'On September 17, 1787, the Constitution, having been finally drafted in\\n', 'clear and simple language, a model to all makers of fundamental law, was\\n', 'adopted. The convention, after nearly four months of debate in secret\\n', 'session, flung open the doors and presented to the Americans the\\n', 'finished plan for the new government. Then the great debate passed to\\n', 'the people.\\n', '\\n', '=The Opposition.=--Storms of criticism at once descended upon the\\n', 'Constitution. \"Fraudulent usurpation!\" exclaimed Gerry, who had refused\\n', 'Pennsylvania newspaper. \"An iron-handed despotism will be the result,\"\\n', 'protested a third. \"We, \\'the low-born,\\'\" sarcastically wrote a fourth,\\n', '\"will now admit the \\'six hundred well-born\\' immediately to establish\\n', 'this most noble, most excellent, and truly divine constitution.\" The\\n', 'President will become a king; Congress will be as tyrannical as\\n', 'Parliament in the old days; the states will be swallowed up; the rights\\n', \"of the people will be trampled upon; the poor man's justice will be lost\\n\", 'in the endless delays of the federal courts--such was the strain of the\\n', 'protests against ratification.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Defense of the Constitution.=--Moved by the tempest of opposition,\\n', 'Hamilton, Madison, and Jay took up their pens in defense of the\\n', 'Constitution. In a series of newspaper articles they discussed and\\n', 'expounded with eloquence, learning, and dignity every important clause\\n', 'and provision of the proposed plan. These papers, afterwards collected\\n', 'and published in a volume known as _The Federalist_, form the finest\\n', 'textbook on the Constitution that has ever been printed. It takes its\\n', 'place, moreover, among the wisest and weightiest treatises on government\\n', 'ever written in any language in any time. Other men, not so gifted, were\\n', 'no less earnest in their support of ratification. In private\\n', 'correspondence, editorials, pamphlets, and letters to the newspapers,\\n', 'they urged their countrymen to forget their partisanship and accept a\\n', 'Constitution which, in spite of any defects great or small, was the\\n', 'only guarantee against dissolution and warfare at home and dishonor and\\n', 'weakness abroad.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Action of the State Conventions.=--Before the end of the year,\\n', '1787, three states had ratified the Constitution: Delaware and New\\n', 'Jersey unanimously and Pennsylvania after a short, though savage,\\n', 'contest. Connecticut and Georgia followed early the next year. Then came\\n', 'the battle royal in Massachusetts, ending in ratification in February by\\n', 'the narrow margin of 187 votes to 168. In the spring came the news that\\n', 'Maryland and South Carolina were \"under the new roof.\" On June 21, New\\n', 'Hampshire, where the sentiment was at first strong enough to defeat the\\n', 'Constitution, joined the new republic, influenced by the favorable\\n', 'decision in Massachusetts. Swift couriers were sent to carry the news to\\n', 'New York and Virginia, where the question of ratification was still\\n', 'undecided. Nine states had accepted it and were united, whether more saw\\n', 'fit to join or not.\\n', '\\n', 'Meanwhile, however, Virginia, after a long and searching debate, had\\n', 'given her approval by a narrow margin, leaving New York as the next seat\\n', 'of anxiety. In that state the popular vote for the delegates to the\\n', 'convention had been clearly and heavily against ratification. Events\\n', 'finally demonstrated the futility of resistance, and Hamilton by good\\n', 'judgment and masterly arguments was at last able to marshal a majority\\n', 'of thirty to twenty-seven votes in favor of ratification.\\n', '\\n', 'The great contest was over. All the states, except North Carolina and\\n', 'Rhode Island, had ratified. \"The sloop Anarchy,\" wrote an ebullient\\n', 'journalist, \"when last heard from was ashore on Union rocks.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The First Election.=--In the autumn of 1788, elections were held to\\n', 'fill the places in the new government. Public opinion was overwhelmingly\\n', 'in favor of Washington as the first President. Yielding to the\\n', 'importunities of friends, he accepted the post in the spirit of public\\n', 'service. On April 30, 1789, he took the oath of office at Federal Hall\\n', 'in New York City. \"Long live George Washington, President of the United\\n', 'States!\" cried Chancellor Livingston as soon as the General had kissed\\n', 'the Bible.

Several members of the House of\\n', 'Representatives, headed by James Madison, had also been at Philadelphia\\n', 'in 1787. In making his appointments, Washington strengthened the new\\n', 'system of government still further by a judicious selection of\\n', 'officials. He chose as Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton,\\n', 'who had been the most zealous for its success; General Knox, head of the\\n', 'War Department, and Edmund Randolph, the Attorney-General, were likewise\\n', 'conspicuous friends of the experiment. Every member of the federal\\n', 'judiciary whom Washington appointed, from the Chief Justice, John Jay,\\n', 'down to the justices of the district courts, had favored the\\n', 'ratification of the Constitution; and a majority of them had served as\\n', 'members of the national convention that framed the document or of the\\n', 'state ratifying conventions. Only one man of influence in the new\\n', 'government, Thomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State, was reckoned as a\\n', 'doubter in the house of the faithful. He had expressed opinions both for\\n', 'and against the Constitution; but he had been out of the country acting\\n', 'as the minister at Paris when the Constitution was drafted and ratified.\\n', '\\n', '=An Opposition to Conciliate.=--The inauguration of Washington amid the\\n', 'plaudits of his countrymen did not set at rest all the political turmoil\\n', 'which had been aroused by the angry contest over ratification. \"The\\n', 'interesting nature of the question,\" wrote John Marshall, \"the equality\\n', 'of the parties, the animation produced inevitably by ardent debate had a\\n', 'necessary tendency to embitter the dispositions of the vanquished and to\\n', 'fix more deeply in many bosoms their prejudices against a plan of\\n', 'government in opposition to which all their passions were enlisted.\" The\\n', 'leaders gathered around Washington were well aware of the excited state\\n', 'of the country. They saw Rhode Island and North Carolina still outside\\n', 'of the union.[1] They knew by what small margins the Constitution had\\n', 'been approved in the great states of Massachusetts, Virginia, and New\\n', 'York. They were equally aware that a majority of the state conventions,\\n', 'in yielding reluctant approval to the Constitution, had drawn a number\\n', 'of amendments for immediate submission to the states.\\n', '\\n', '=The First Amendments--a Bill of Rights.=--To meet the opposition,\\n', 'Madison proposed, and the first Congress adopted, a series of amendments\\n', 'to the Constitution. Ten of them were soon ratified and became in 1791 a\\n', 'part of the law of the land. These amendments provided, among other\\n', 'things, that Congress could make no law respecting the establishment of\\n', 'religion, abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right\\n', 'of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for a\\n', 'redress of grievances. They also guaranteed indictment by grand jury and\\n', 'trial by jury for all persons charged by federal officers with serious\\n', 'crimes. To reassure those who still feared that local rights might be\\n', 'invaded by the federal government, the tenth amendment expressly\\n', 'provided that the powers not delegated to the United States by the\\n', 'Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the\\n', 'states respectively or to the people. Seven years later, the eleventh\\n', 'amendment was written in the same spirit as the first ten, after a\\n', 'heated debate over the action of the Supreme Court in permitting a\\n', 'citizen to bring a suit against \"the sovereign state\" of Georgia. The\\n', 'new amendment was designed to protect states against the federal\\n', 'judiciary by forbidding it to hear any case in which a state was sued by\\n', 'a citizen.\\n', '\\n', '=Funding the National Debt.=--Paper declarations of rights, however,\\n', 'paid no bills. To this task Hamilton turned all his splendid genius. At\\n', 'the very outset he addressed himself to the problem of the huge public\\n', 'debt, daily mounting as the unpaid interest accumulated. In a _Report on\\n', 'Public Credit_ under date of January 9, 1790, one of the first and\\n', 'greatest of American state papers, he laid before Congress the outlines\\n', 'of his plan. He proposed that the federal government should call in all\\n', 'the old bonds, certificates of indebtedness, and other promises to pay\\n', 'which had been issued by the Congress since the beginning of the\\n', 'Revolution. These national obligations, he urged, should be put into one\\n', 'consolidated debt resting on the credit of the United States; to the\\n', 'holders of the old paper should be issued new bonds drawing interest at\\n', 'fixed rates. This process was called \"funding the debt.\" Such a\\n', 'provision for the support of public credit, Hamilton insisted, would\\n', 'satisfy creditors, restore landed property to its former value, and\\n', 'furnish new resources to agriculture and commerce in the form of credit\\n', 'and capital.\\n', '\\n', '=Assumption and Funding of State Debts.=--Hamilton then turned to the\\n', 'obligations incurred by the several states in support of the Revolution.\\n', 'These debts he proposed to add to the national debt. They were to be\\n', '\"assumed\" by the United States government and placed on the same secure\\n', 'foundation as the continental debt. This measure he defended not merely\\n', 'on grounds of national honor. It would, as he foresaw, give strength to\\n', 'the new national government by making all public creditors, men of\\n', 'substance in their several communities, look to the federal, rather than\\n', 'the state government, for the satisfaction of their claims.\\n', '\\n', '=Funding at Face Value.=--On the question of the terms of consolidation,\\n', 'assumption, and funding, Hamilton had a firm conviction. That millions\\n', \"of dollars' worth of the continental and state bonds had passed out of\\n\", 'the hands of those who had originally subscribed their funds to the\\n', 'support of the government or had sold supplies for the Revolutionary\\n', 'army was well known. It was also a matter of common knowledge that a\\n', 'very large part of these bonds had been bought by speculators at ruinous\\n', 'figures--ten, twenty, and thirty cents on the dollar. Accordingly, it\\n', 'had been suggested, even in very respectable quarters, that a\\n', 'discrimination should be made between original holders and speculative\\n', 'purchasers. Some who held this opinion urged that the speculators who\\n', 'had paid nominal sums for their bonds should be reimbursed for their\\n', 'outlays and the original holders paid the difference; others said that\\n', 'the government should \"scale the debt\" by redeeming, not at full value\\n', 'but at a figure reasonably above the market price. Against the\\n', 'proposition Hamilton set his face like flint. He maintained that the\\n', 'government was honestly bound to redeem every bond at its face value,\\n', 'although the difficulty of securing revenue made necessary a lower rate\\n', 'of interest on a part of the bonds and the deferring of interest on\\n', 'another part.\\n', '\\n', '=Funding and Assumption Carried.=--There was little difficulty in\\n', 'securing the approval of both houses of Congress for the funding of the\\n', 'national debt at full value. The bill for the assumption of state debts,\\n', 'however, brought the sharpest division of opinions. To the Southern\\n', \"members of Congress assumption was a gross violation of states' rights,\\n\", 'without any warrant in the Constitution and devised in the interest of\\n', 'Northern speculators who, anticipating assumption and funding, had\\n', 'bought up at low prices the Southern bonds and other promises to pay.\\n', 'New England, on the other hand, was strongly in favor of assumption;\\n', 'several representatives from that section were rash enough to threaten a\\n', 'dissolution of the union if the bill was defeated. To this dispute was\\n', 'added an equally bitter quarrel over the location of the national\\n', 'capital, then temporarily at New York City.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'threatened the very existence of the young government. Washington and\\n', 'Hamilton were thoroughly alarmed. Hearing of the extremity to which the\\n', 'contest had been carried and acting on the appeal from the Secretary of\\n', 'the Treasury, Jefferson intervened at this point. By skillful management\\n', 'at a good dinner he brought the opposing leaders together; and thus once\\n', 'more, as on many other occasions, peace was purchased and the union\\n', 'saved by compromise. The bargain this time consisted of an exchange of\\n', 'votes for assumption in return for votes for the capital. Enough\\n', 'Southern members voted for assumption to pass the bill, and a majority\\n', 'was mustered in favor of building the capital on the banks of the\\n', 'Potomac, after locating it for a ten-year period at Philadelphia to\\n', 'satisfy Pennsylvania members.\\n', '\\n', '=The United States Bank.=--Encouraged by the success of his funding and\\n', 'assumption measures, Hamilton laid before Congress a project for a great\\n', 'United States Bank. He proposed that a private corporation be chartered\\n', 'by Congress, authorized to raise a capital stock of $10,000,000\\n', '(three-fourths in new six per cent federal bonds and one-fourth in\\n', 'specie) and empowered to issue paper currency under proper safeguards.\\n', 'Many advantages, Hamilton contended, would accrue to the government from\\n', 'this institution. The price of the government bonds would be increased,\\n', 'uniform value from one end of the land to the other. The branches of the\\n', 'bank in various cities would make easy the exchange of funds so vital to\\n', 'commercial transactions on a national scale. Finally, through the issue\\n', 'of bank notes, the money capital available for agriculture and industry\\n', 'would be increased, thus stimulating business enterprise. Jefferson\\n', 'hotly attacked the bank on the ground that Congress had no power\\n', 'whatever under the Constitution to charter such a private corporation.\\n', 'Hamilton defended it with great cogency. Washington, after weighing all\\n', 'opinions, decided in favor of the proposal. In 1791 the bill\\n', 'establishing the first United States Bank for a period of twenty years\\n', 'became a law.\\n', '\\n', 'protection of American industries. The first revenue act of 1789, though\\n', 'designed primarily to bring money into the empty treasury, declared in\\n', 'favor of the principle. The following year Washington referred to the\\n', 'subject in his address to Congress. Thereupon Hamilton was instructed to\\n', 'prepare recommendations for legislative action. The result, after a\\n', 'delay of more than a year, was his _Report on Manufactures_, another\\n', 'state paper worthy, in closeness of reasoning and keenness of\\n', 'understanding, of a place beside his report on public credit. Hamilton\\n', 'based his argument on the broadest national grounds: the protective\\n', 'tariff would, by encouraging the building of factories, create a home\\n', 'market for the produce of farms and plantations; by making the United\\n', 'States independent of other countries in times of peace, it would double\\n', 'its security in time of war; by making use of the labor of women and\\n', 'children, it would turn to the production of goods persons otherwise\\n', 'idle or only partly employed; by increasing the trade between the North\\n', 'and South it would strengthen the links of union and add to political\\n', 'ties those of commerce and intercourse. The revenue measure of 1792 bore\\n', 'the impress of these arguments.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"=Dissensions over Hamilton's Measures.=--Hamilton's plans, touching\\n\", 'deeply as they did the resources of individuals and the interests of the\\n', 'states, awakened alarm and opposition. Funding at face value, said his\\n', 'critics, was a government favor to speculators; the assumption of state\\n', 'debts was a deep design to undermine the state governments; Congress had\\n', 'no constitutional power to create a bank; the law creating the bank\\n', 'merely allowed a private corporation to make paper money and lend it at\\n', 'a high rate of interest; and the tariff was a tax on land and labor for\\n', 'the benefit of manufacturers.\\n', '\\n', \"Hamilton's reply to this bill of indictment was simple and\\n\", 'straightforward. Some rascally speculators had profited from the funding\\n', 'of the debt at face value, but that was only an incident in the\\n', 'restoration of public credit. In view of the jealousies of the states it\\n', 'was a good thing to reduce their powers and pretensions. The\\n', 'Constitution was not to be interpreted narrowly but in the full light of\\n', 'national needs. The bank would enlarge the amount of capital so sorely\\n', 'needed to start up American industries, giving markets to farmers and\\n', 'planters. The tariff by creating a home market and increasing\\n', 'opportunities for employment would benefit both land and labor. Out of\\n', 'such wise policies firmly pursued by the government, he concluded, were\\n', 'bound to come strength and prosperity for the new government at home,\\n', 'credit and power abroad. This view Washington fully indorsed, adding\\n', 'the weight of his great name to the inherent merits of the measures\\n', 'adopted under his administration.\\n', '\\n', '=The Sharpness of the Partisan Conflict.=--As a result of the clash of\\n', 'opinion, the people of the country gradually divided into two parties:\\n', 'Federalists and Anti-Federalists, the former led by Hamilton, the latter\\n', 'by Jefferson. The strength of the Federalists lay in the cities--Boston,\\n', 'Providence, Hartford, New York, Philadelphia, Charleston--among the\\n', 'manufacturing, financial, and commercial groups of the population who\\n', 'were eager to extend their business operations. The strength of the\\n', 'Anti-Federalists lay mainly among the debt-burdened farmers who feared\\n', 'the growth of what they called \"a money power\" and planters in all\\n', 'sections who feared the dominance of commercial and manufacturing\\n', 'interests. The farming and planting South, outside of the few towns,\\n', 'finally presented an almost solid front against assumption, the bank,\\n', 'and the tariff. The conflict between the parties grew steadily in\\n', 'bitterness, despite the conciliatory and engaging manner in which\\n', 'Hamilton presented his cause in his state papers and despite the\\n', 'constant efforts of Washington to soften the asperity of the\\n', 'contestants.\\n', '\\n', '=The Leadership and Doctrines of Jefferson.=--The party dispute had not\\n', 'gone far before the opponents of the administration began to look to\\n', \"Jefferson as their leader. Some of Hamilton's measures he had approved,\\n\", 'declaring afterward that he did not at the time understand their\\n', 'significance. Others, particularly the bank, he fiercely assailed. More\\n', 'than once, he and Hamilton, shaking violently with anger, attacked each\\n', 'other at cabinet meetings, and nothing short of the grave and dignified\\n', 'pleas of Washington prevented an early and open break between them. In\\n', '1794 it finally came. Jefferson resigned as Secretary of State and\\n', 'retired to his home in Virginia to assume, through correspondence and\\n', 'negotiation, the leadership of the steadily growing party of opposition.\\n', '\\n', 'Shy and modest in manner, halting in speech, disliking the turmoil of\\n', 'public debate, and deeply interested in science and philosophy,\\n', 'Jefferson was not very well fitted for the strenuous life of political\\n', 'contest. Nevertheless, he was an ambitious and shrewd negotiator. He was\\n', 'also by honest opinion and matured conviction the exact opposite of\\n', 'Hamilton. The latter believed in a strong, active, \"high-toned\"\\n', 'government, vigorously compelling in all its branches. Jefferson looked\\n', 'upon such government as dangerous to the liberties of citizens and\\n', 'openly avowed his faith in the desirability of occasional popular\\n', 'uprisings. Hamilton distrusted the people. \"Your people is a great\\n', 'beast,\" he is reported to have said. Jefferson professed his faith in\\n', 'the people with an abandon that was considered reckless in his time.\\n', '\\n', 'On economic matters, the opinions of the two leaders were also\\n', 'hopelessly at variance. Hamilton, while cherishing agriculture, desired\\n', 'to see America a great commercial and industrial nation. Jefferson was\\n', 'equally set against this course for his country. He feared the\\n', 'accumulation of riches and the growth of a large urban working class.\\n', 'The mobs of great cities, he said, are sores on the body politic;\\n', 'artisans are usually the dangerous element that make revolutions;\\n', 'workshops should be kept in Europe and with them the artisans with their\\n', 'insidious morals and manners. The only substantial foundation for a\\n', 'republic, Jefferson believed to be agriculture. The spirit of\\n', 'independence could be kept alive only by free farmers, owning the land\\n', 'they tilled and looking to the sun in heaven and the labor of their\\n', 'hands for their sustenance. Trusting as he did in the innate goodness of\\n', 'human nature when nourished on a free soil, Jefferson advocated those\\n', 'measures calculated to favor agriculture and to enlarge the rights of\\n', 'persons rather than the powers of government. Thus he became the\\n', 'champion of the individual against the interference of the government,\\n', 'and an ardent advocate of freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and\\n', 'freedom of scientific inquiry. It was, accordingly, no mere factious\\n', 'spirit that drove him into opposition to Hamilton.\\n', '\\n', '=The Whisky Rebellion.=--The political agitation of the Anti-Federalists\\n', 'was accompanied by an armed revolt against the government in 1794. The\\n', \"occasion for this uprising was another of Hamilton's measures, a law\\n\", 'laying an excise tax on distilled spirits, for the purpose of increasing\\n', 'the revenue needed to pay the interest on the funded debt. It so\\n', 'happened that a very considerable part of the whisky manufactured in the\\n', 'country was made by the farmers, especially on the frontier, in their\\n', 'own stills. The new revenue law meant that federal officers would now\\n', 'come into the homes of the people, measure their liquor, and take the\\n', 'tax out of their pockets. All the bitterness which farmers felt against\\n', 'the fiscal measures of the government was redoubled. In the western\\n', 'districts of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina, they refused to\\n', 'pay the tax. In Pennsylvania, some of them sacked and burned the houses\\n', 'of the tax collectors, as the Revolutionists thirty years before had\\n', 'mobbed the agents of King George sent over to sell stamps. They were in\\n', 'a fair way to nullify the law in whole districts when Washington called\\n', 'out the troops to suppress \"the Whisky Rebellion.\" Then the movement\\n', 'collapsed; but it left behind a deep-seated resentment which flared up\\n', 'in the election of several obdurate Anti-Federalist Congressmen from the\\n', 'disaffected regions.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The French Revolution.=--In this exciting period, when all America was\\n', 'distracted by partisan disputes, a storm broke in Europe--the\\n', 'epoch-making French Revolution--which not only shook the thrones of the\\n', 'Old World but stirred to its depths the young republic of the New World.\\n', 'The first scene in this dramatic affair occurred in the spring of 1789,\\n', 'a few days after Washington was inaugurated. The king of France, Louis\\n', 'to resort to his people for financial help. Accordingly he called, for\\n', 'the first time in more than one hundred fifty years, a meeting of the\\n', 'national parliament, the \"Estates General,\" composed of representatives\\n', 'of the \"three estates\"--the clergy, nobility, and commoners. Acting\\n', 'under powerful leaders, the commoners, or \"third estate,\" swept aside\\n', 'the clergy and nobility and resolved themselves into a national\\n', 'assembly. This stirred the country to its depths.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Great events followed in swift succession. On July 14, 1789, the\\n', \"Bastille, an old royal prison, symbol of the king's absolutism, was\\n\", 'stormed by a Paris crowd and destroyed.

Little disorder accompanied\\n', 'these startling changes. To all appearances a peaceful revolution had\\n', 'stripped the French king of his royal prerogatives and based the\\n', 'government of his country on the consent of the governed.\\n', '\\n', '=American Influence in France.=--In undertaking their great political\\n', 'revolt the French had been encouraged by the outcome of the American\\n', 'Revolution. Officers and soldiers, who had served in the American war,\\n', 'reported to their French countrymen marvelous tales. At the frugal table\\n', 'of General Washington, in council with the unpretentious Franklin, or at\\n', 'conferences over the strategy of war, French noblemen of ancient lineage\\n', 'learned to respect both the talents and the simple character of the\\n', 'leaders in the great republican commonwealth beyond the seas. Travelers,\\n', 'who had gone to see the experiment in republicanism with their own eyes,\\n', 'carried home to the king and ruling class stories of an astounding\\n', 'system of popular government.\\n', '\\n', 'On the other hand the dalliance with American democracy was regarded by\\n', 'French conservatives as playing with fire. \"When we think of the false\\n', 'ideas of government and philanthropy,\" wrote one of Lafayette\\'s aides,\\n', '\"which these youths acquired in America and propagated in France with so\\n', 'much enthusiasm and such deplorable success--for this mania of imitation\\n', 'powerfully aided the Revolution, though it was not the sole cause of\\n', 'it--we are bound to confess that it would have been better, both for\\n', 'themselves and for us, if these young philosophers in red-heeled shoes\\n', 'had stayed at home in attendance on the court.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Early American Opinion of the French Revolution.=--So close were the\\n', 'ties between the two nations that it is not surprising to find every\\n', 'step in the first stages of the French Revolution greeted with applause\\n', 'in the United States. \"Liberty will have another feather in her cap,\"\\n', 'exultantly wrote a Boston editor. \"In no part of the globe,\" soberly\\n', 'wrote John Marshall, \"was this revolution hailed with more joy than in\\n', 'America.... But one sentiment existed.\" The main key to the Bastille,\\n', 'sent to Washington as a memento, was accepted as \"a token of the\\n', 'victory gained by liberty.\" Thomas Paine saw in the great event \"the\\n', 'first ripe fruits of American principles transplanted into Europe.\"\\n', 'Federalists and Anti-Federalists regarded the new constitution of France\\n', 'as another vindication of American ideals.\\n', '\\n', '=The Reign of Terror.=--While profuse congratulations were being\\n', 'exchanged, rumors began to come that all was not well in France. Many\\n', 'noblemen, enraged at the loss of their special privileges, fled into\\n', 'Germany and plotted an invasion of France to overthrow the new system of\\n', 'monarchs on the continent to secure their help in the same enterprise,\\n', 'and he finally betrayed to the French people his true sentiments by\\n', 'attempting to escape from his kingdom, only to be captured and taken\\n', 'back to Paris in disgrace.\\n', '\\n', 'from all share in the government by the first French constitution,\\n', 'became restless, especially in Paris. Assembling on the Champs de Mars,\\n', 'a great open field, they signed a petition calling for another\\n', 'constitution giving them the suffrage. When told to disperse, they\\n', 'refused and were fired upon by the national guard. This \"massacre,\" as\\n', '\"Jacobins,\" then sprang up, taking its name from a Jacobin monastery in\\n', 'which it held its sessions. In a little while it became the master of\\n', 'the popular convention convoked in September, 1792. The monarchy was\\n', 'immediately abolished and a republic established. On January 21, 1793,\\n', 'Louis was sent to the scaffold. To the war on Austria, already raging,\\n', 'was added a war on England. Then came the Reign of Terror, during which\\n', 'radicals in possession of the convention executed in large numbers\\n', 'counter-revolutionists and those suspected of sympathy with the\\n', 'monarchy. They shot down peasants who rose in insurrection against their\\n', 'rule and established a relentless dictatorship. Civil war followed.\\n', 'Terrible atrocities were committed on both sides in the name of liberty,\\n', 'and in the name of monarchy. To Americans of conservative temper it now\\n', 'seemed that the Revolution, so auspiciously begun, had degenerated into\\n', 'anarchy and mere bloodthirsty strife.\\n', '\\n', '=Burke Summons the World to War on France.=--In England, Edmund Burke\\n', 'led the fight against the new French principles which he feared might\\n', 'spread to all Europe. In his _Reflections on the French Revolution_,\\n', 'written in 1790, he attacked with terrible wrath the whole program of\\n', 'popular government; he called for war, relentless war, upon the French\\n', 'as monsters and outlaws; he demanded that they be reduced to order by\\n', 'the restoration of the king to full power under the protection of the\\n', 'arms of European nations.\\n', '\\n', \"=Paine's Defense of the French Revolution.=--To counteract the campaign\\n\", 'of hate against the French, Thomas Paine replied to Burke in another of\\n', 'his famous tracts, _The Rights of Man_, which was given to the American\\n', 'public in an edition containing a letter of approval from Jefferson.\\n', 'Burke, said Paine, had been mourning about the glories of the French\\n', 'monarchy and aristocracy but had forgotten the starving peasants and the\\n', 'oppressed people; had wept over the plumage and neglected the dying\\n', 'bird. Burke had denied the right of the French people to choose their\\n', 'own governors, blandly forgetting that the English government in which\\n', 'he saw final perfection itself rested on two revolutions. He had boasted\\n', 'that the king of England held his crown in contempt of the democratic\\n', 'that the doctrines of the rights of man were \"new fangled,\" Paine\\n', 'replied that the question was not whether they were new or old but\\n', 'whether they were right or wrong. As to the French disorders and\\n', 'difficulties, he bade the world wait to see what would be brought forth\\n', 'in due time.\\n', '\\n', '=The Effect of the French Revolution on American Politics.=--The course\\n', 'of the French Revolution and the controversies accompanying it,\\n', 'exercised a profound influence on the formation of the first political\\n', 'parties in America. The followers of Hamilton, now proud of the name\\n', '\"Federalists,\" drew back in fright as they heard of the cruel deeds\\n', 'committed during the Reign of Terror. They turned savagely upon the\\n', 'revolutionists and their friends in America, denouncing as \"Jacobin\"\\n', 'everybody who did not condemn loudly enough the proceedings of the\\n', 'atheistical, anarchical, and in other respects immoral principles of the\\n', 'French Republicans\"; he then proceeded with equal passion to attack\\n', 'Jefferson and the Anti-Federalists, whom he charged with spreading false\\n', 'French propaganda and betraying America. \"The editors, patrons, and\\n', 'abettors of these vehicles of slander,\" he exclaimed, \"ought to be\\n', 'considered and treated as enemies to their country.... Of all traitors\\n', 'they are the most aggravatedly criminal; of all villains, they are the\\n', 'most infamous and detestable.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Anti-Federalists, as a matter of fact, were generally favorable to\\n', 'the Revolution although they deplored many of the events associated with\\n', \"it. Paine's pamphlet, indorsed by Jefferson, was widely read. Democratic\\n\", 'societies, after the fashion of French political clubs, arose in the\\n', 'cities; the coalition of European monarchs against France was denounced\\n', 'as a coalition against the very principles of republicanism; and the\\n', 'Philadelphia. Harmless titles, such as \"Sir,\" \"the Honorable,\" and \"His\\n', 'Excellency,\" were decried as aristocratic and some of the more excited\\n', 'insisted on adopting the French title, \"Citizen,\" speaking, for example,\\n', 'of \"Citizen Judge\" and \"Citizen Toastmaster.\" Pamphlets in defense of\\n', 'the French streamed from the press, while subsidized newspapers kept the\\n', 'propaganda in full swing.\\n', '\\n', '=The European War Disturbs American Commerce.=--This battle of wits, or\\n', 'rather contest in calumny, might have gone on indefinitely in America\\n', 'without producing any serious results, had it not been for the war\\n', 'between England and France, then raging. The English, having command of\\n', 'the seas, claimed the right to seize American produce bound for French\\n', 'ports and to confiscate American ships engaged in carrying French goods.\\n', 'Adding fuel to a fire already hot enough, they began to search American\\n', 'ships and to carry off British-born sailors found on board American\\n', 'vessels.\\n', '\\n', '=The French Appeal for Help.=--At the same time the French Republic\\n', 'turned to the United States for aid in its war on England and sent over\\n', 'as its diplomatic representative \"Citizen\" Genet, an ardent supporter of\\n', 'the new order. On his arrival at Charleston, he was greeted with fervor\\n', 'by the Anti-Federalists. As he made his way North, he was wined and\\n', 'dined and given popular ovations that turned his head. He thought the\\n', 'whole country was ready to join the French Republic in its contest with\\n', 'England. Genet therefore attempted to use the American ports as the base\\n', 'of operations for French privateers preying on British merchant ships;\\n', 'and he insisted that the United States was in honor bound to help France\\n', 'under the treaty of 1778.\\n', '\\n', '=The Proclamation of Neutrality and the Jay Treaty.=--Unmoved by the\\n', '\\n', 'rising tide of popular sympathy for France, Washington took a firm\\n', 'course. He received Genet coldly. The demand that the United States aid\\n', 'France under the old treaty of alliance he answered by proclaiming the\\n', 'neutrality of America and warning American citizens against hostile acts\\n', 'toward either France or England. When Genet continued to hold meetings,\\n', 'issue manifestoes, and stir up the people against England, Washington\\n', 'asked the French government to recall him. This act he followed up by\\n', 'sending the Chief Justice, John Jay, on a pacific mission to England.\\n', '\\n', 'The result was the celebrated Jay treaty of 1794. By its terms Great\\n', 'Britain agreed to withdraw her troops from the western forts where they\\n', 'had been since the war for independence and to grant certain slight\\n', 'trade concessions. The chief sources of bitterness--the failure of the\\n', 'British to return slaves carried off during the Revolution, the seizure\\n', 'of American ships, and the impressment of sailors--were not touched,\\n', 'much to the distress of everybody in America, including loyal\\n', 'Federalists. Nevertheless, Washington, dreading an armed conflict with\\n', 'England, urged the Senate to ratify the treaty. The weight of his\\n', 'influence carried the day.\\n', '\\n', 'At this, the hostility of the Anti-Federalists knew no bounds. Jefferson\\n', 'declared the Jay treaty \"an infamous act which is really nothing more\\n', 'than an alliance between England and the Anglo-men of this country,\\n', 'against the legislature and the people of the United States.\" Hamilton,\\n', 'defending it with his usual courage, was stoned by a mob in New York and\\n', 'driven from the platform with blood streaming from his face. Jay was\\n', 'burned in effigy. Even Washington was not spared. The House of\\n', 'Representatives was openly hostile. To display its feelings, it called\\n', 'upon the President for the papers relative to the treaty negotiations,\\n', 'only to be more highly incensed by his flat refusal to present them, on\\n', 'the ground that the House did not share in the treaty-making power.\\n', '\\n', '=Washington Retires from Politics.=--Such angry contests confirmed the\\n', 'President in his slowly maturing determination to retire at the end of\\n', 'his second term in office. He did not believe that a third term was\\n', 'unconstitutional or improper; but, worn out by his long and arduous\\n', 'labors in war and in peace and wounded by harsh attacks from former\\n', 'friends, he longed for the quiet of his beautiful estate at Mount\\n', 'Vernon.\\n', '\\n', 'In September, 1796, on the eve of the presidential election, Washington\\n', 'issued his Farewell Address, another state paper to be treasured and\\n', 'read by generations of Americans to come. In this address he directed\\n', 'the attention of the people to three subjects of lasting interest. He\\n', 'warned them against sectional jealousies. He remonstrated against the\\n', 'spirit of partisanship, saying that in government \"of the popular\\n', 'character, in government purely elective, it is a spirit not to be\\n', 'encouraged.\" He likewise cautioned the people against \"the insidious\\n', 'wiles of foreign influence,\" saying: \"Europe has a set of primary\\n', 'interests which to us have none or a very remote relation. Hence she\\n', 'must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are\\n', 'essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it would be\\n', 'unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary\\n', 'vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions\\n', 'of her friendships or enmities.... Why forego the advantages of so\\n', 'peculiar a situation?... It is our true policy to steer clear of\\n', 'permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.... Taking\\n', 'care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on a\\n', 'respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary\\n', 'alliances for extraordinary emergencies.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Campaign of 1796--Adams Elected.=--On hearing of the retirement of\\n', 'Washington, the Anti-Federalists cast off all restraints. In honor of\\n', 'France and in opposition to what they were pleased to call the\\n', 'monarchical tendencies of the Federalists, they boldly assumed the name\\n', '\"Republican\"; the term \"Democrat,\" then applied only to obscure and\\n', 'despised radicals, had not come into general use. They selected\\n', 'Jefferson as their candidate for President against John Adams, the\\n', 'Federalist nominee, and carried on such a spirited campaign that they\\n', 'came within four votes of electing him.\\n', '\\n', 'The successful candidate, Adams, was not fitted by training or opinion\\n', 'for conciliating a determined opposition. He was a reserved and studious\\n', 'man. He was neither a good speaker nor a skillful negotiator. In one of\\n', 'his books he had declared himself in favor of \"government by an\\n', 'aristocracy of talents and wealth\"--an offense which the Republicans\\n', 'never forgave. While John Marshall found him \"a sensible, plain, candid,\\n', 'good-tempered man,\" Jefferson could see in him nothing but a \"monocrat\"\\n', 'and \"Anglo-man.\" Had it not been for the conduct of the French\\n', \"government, Adams would hardly have enjoyed a moment's genuine\\n\", 'popularity during his administration.\\n', '\\n', '=The Quarrel with France.=--The French Directory, the executive\\n', 'department established under the constitution of 1795, managed, however,\\n', 'to stir the anger of Republicans and Federalists alike. It regarded the\\n', 'Jay treaty as a rebuke to France and a flagrant violation of obligations\\n', 'solemnly registered in the treaty of 1778. Accordingly it refused to\\n', 'receive the American minister, treated him in a humiliating way, and\\n', 'finally told him to leave the country. Overlooking this affront in his\\n', 'anxiety to maintain peace, Adams dispatched to France a commission of\\n', 'eminent men with instructions to reach an understanding with the French\\n', 'Republic. On their arrival, they were chagrined to find, instead of a\\n', 'decent reception, an indirect demand for an apology respecting the past\\n', 'conduct of the American government, a payment in cash, and an annual\\n', 'tribute as the price of continued friendship. When the news of this\\n', 'affair reached President Adams, he promptly laid it before Congress,\\n', '\\n', 'This insult, coupled with the fact that French privateers, like the\\n', 'British, were preying upon American commerce, enraged even the\\n', 'Republicans who had been loudest in the profession of their French\\n', 'sympathies. They forgot their wrath over the Jay treaty and joined with\\n', 'the Federalists in shouting: \"Millions for defense, not a cent for\\n', 'tribute!\" Preparations for war were made on every hand. Washington was\\n', 'once more called from Mount Vernon to take his old position at the head\\n', 'of the army. Indeed, fighting actually began upon the high seas and went\\n', 'on without a formal declaration of war until the year 1800. By that time\\n', 'Napoleon, the First Consul, who was beginning his remarkable career as\\n', 'chief of the French Republic, soon to be turned into an empire.\\n', '\\n', '=Alien and Sedition Laws.=--Flushed with success, the Federalists\\n', 'determined, if possible, to put an end to radical French influence in\\n', 'America and to silence Republican opposition. They therefore passed two\\n', 'drastic laws in the summer of 1798: the Alien and Sedition Acts.\\n', '\\n', 'The first of these measures empowered the President to expel from the\\n', 'country or to imprison any alien whom he regarded as \"dangerous\" or \"had\\n', 'reasonable grounds to suspect\" of \"any treasonable or secret\\n', 'machinations against the government.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The second of the measures, the Sedition Act, penalized not only those\\n', 'who attempted to stir up unlawful combinations against the government\\n', 'but also every one who wrote, uttered, or published \"any false,\\n', 'scandalous, and malicious writing ... against the government of the\\n', 'United States or either House of Congress, or the President of the\\n', 'United States, with intent to defame said government ... or to bring\\n', 'them or either of them into contempt or disrepute.\" This measure was\\n', 'hurried through Congress in spite of the opposition and the clear\\n', 'provision in the Constitution that Congress shall make no law abridging\\n', 'the freedom of speech or of the press. Even many Federalists feared the\\n', 'consequences of the action. Hamilton was alarmed when he read the bill,\\n', 'exclaiming: \"Let us not establish a tyranny. Energy is a very different\\n', 'thing from violence.\" John Marshall told his friends in Virginia that,\\n', 'had he been in Congress, he would have opposed the two bills because he\\n', 'thought them \"useless\" and \"calculated to create unnecessary discontents\\n', 'and jealousies.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Alien law was not enforced; but it gave great offense to the Irish\\n', \"and French whose activities against the American government's policy\\n\", 'respecting Great Britain put them in danger of prison. The Sedition law,\\n', 'on the other hand, was vigorously applied. Several editors of Republican\\n', 'newspapers soon found themselves in jail or broken by ruinous fines for\\n', 'their caustic criticisms of the Federalist President and his policies.\\n', 'Bystanders at political meetings, who uttered sentiments which, though\\n', 'ungenerous and severe, seem harmless enough now, were hurried before\\n', 'Federalist judges and promptly fined and imprisoned. Although the\\n', 'prosecutions were not numerous, they aroused a keen resentment. The\\n', 'Republicans were convinced that their political opponents, having\\n', \"saddled upon the country Hamilton's fiscal system and the British\\n\", 'treaty, were bent on silencing all censure. The measures therefore had\\n', 'exactly the opposite effect from that which their authors intended.\\n', 'Instead of helping the Federalist party, they made criticism of it more\\n', 'bitter than ever.\\n', '\\n', '=The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions.=--Jefferson was quick to take\\n', 'advantage of the discontent. He drafted a set of resolutions declaring\\n', 'the Sedition law null and void, as violating the federal Constitution.\\n', 'His resolutions were passed by the Kentucky legislature late in 1798,\\n', 'signed by the governor, and transmitted to the other states for their\\n', 'consideration. Though receiving unfavorable replies from a number of\\n', 'Northern states, Kentucky the following year reaffirmed its position and\\n', 'declared that the nullification of all unconstitutional acts of Congress\\n', 'was the rightful remedy to be used by the states in the redress of\\n', 'grievances. It thus defied the federal government and announced a\\n', 'doctrine hostile to nationality and fraught with terrible meaning for\\n', 'the future. In the neighboring state of Virginia, Madison led a movement\\n', 'against the Alien and Sedition laws. He induced the legislature to pass\\n', 'resolutions condemning the acts as unconstitutional and calling upon the\\n', 'other states to take proper means to preserve their rights and the\\n', 'rights of the people.\\n', '\\n', '=The Republican Triumph in 1800.=--Thus the way was prepared for the\\n', 'election of 1800. The Republicans left no stone unturned in their\\n', 'efforts to place on the Federalist candidate, President Adams, all the\\n', 'odium of the Alien and Sedition laws, in addition to responsibility for\\n', \"approving Hamilton's measures and policies. The Federalists, divided in\\n\", 'councils and cold in their affection for Adams, made a poor campaign.\\n', 'They tried to discredit their opponents with epithets of \"Jacobins\" and\\n', '\"Anarchists\"--terms which had been weakened by excessive use. When the\\n', 'vote was counted, it was found that Adams had been defeated; while the\\n', 'Republicans had carried the entire South and New York also and secured\\n', 'eight of the fifteen electoral votes cast by Pennsylvania. \"Our beloved\\n', 'Adams will now close his bright career,\" lamented a Federalist\\n', 'newspaper. \"Sons of faction, demagogues and high priests of anarchy, now\\n', 'you have cause to triumph!\"\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _An old cartoon_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"Jefferson's election, however, was still uncertain.

It so happened that Aaron\\n', 'Burr, the Republican candidate for Vice President, had received the same\\n', 'number of votes as Jefferson; as neither had a majority the election was\\n', 'thrown into the House of Representatives, where the Federalists held the\\n', 'balance of power.

This was provincialism with a\\n', 'vengeance. \"It is jealousy, not confidence, which prescribes limited\\n', 'constitutions,\" wrote Jefferson for the Kentucky legislature. Jealousy\\n', 'of the national government, not confidence in it--this is the ideal that\\n', 'reflected the provincial and agricultural interest.\\n', '\\n', '=Republican Simplicity.=--Every act of the Jeffersonian party during its\\n', 'early days of power was in accord with the ideals of government which it\\n', 'professed. It had opposed all pomp and ceremony, calculated to give\\n', 'weight and dignity to the chief executive of the nation, as symbols of\\n', \"monarchy and high prerogative. Appropriately, therefore, Jefferson's\\n\", 'inauguration on March 4, 1801, the first at the new capital at\\n', 'Washington, was marked by extreme simplicity. In keeping with this\\n', 'procedure he quit the practice, followed by Washington and Adams, of\\n', 'reading presidential addresses to Congress in joint assembly and adopted\\n', 'in its stead the plan of sending his messages in writing--a custom that\\n', 'was continued unbroken until 1913 when President Wilson returned to the\\n', 'example set by the first chief magistrate.\\n', '\\n', '=Republican Measures.=--The Republicans had complained of a great\\n', 'national debt as the source of a dangerous \"money power,\" giving\\n', 'strength to the federal government; accordingly they began to pay it off\\n', 'as rapidly as possible. They had held commerce in low esteem and looked\\n', 'upon a large navy as a mere device to protect it; consequently they\\n', 'reduced the number of warships. They had objected to excise taxes,\\n', 'particularly on whisky; these they quickly abolished, to the intense\\n', 'satisfaction of the farmers. They had protested against the heavy cost\\n', 'of the federal government; they reduced expenses by discharging hundreds\\n', 'of men from the army and abolishing many offices.\\n', '\\n', 'They had savagely criticized the Sedition law and Jefferson refused to\\n', 'enforce it. They had been deeply offended by the assault on freedom of\\n', 'speech and press and they promptly impeached Samuel Chase, a justice of\\n', 'the Supreme Court, who had been especially severe in his attacks upon\\n', 'offenders under the Sedition Act. Their failure to convict Justice Chase\\n', 'by a narrow margin was due to no lack of zeal on their part but to the\\n', 'Federalist strength in the Senate where the trial was held. They had\\n', 'regarded the appointment of a large number of federal judges during the\\n', \"last hours of Adams' administration as an attempt to intrench\\n\", 'Federalists in the judiciary and to enlarge the sphere of the national\\n', 'government. Accordingly, they at once repealed the act creating the new\\n', 'judgeships, thus depriving the \"midnight appointees\" of their posts.\\n', 'They had considered the federal offices, civil and military, as sources\\n', 'of great strength to the Federalists and Jefferson, though committed to\\n', 'the principle that offices should be open to all and distributed\\n', 'according to merit, was careful to fill most of the vacancies as they\\n', 'occurred with trusted Republicans. To his credit, however, it must be\\n', 'said that he did not make wholesale removals to find room for party\\n', 'workers.\\n', '\\n', 'The Republicans thus hewed to the line of their general policy of\\n', 'restricting the weight, dignity, and activity of the national\\n', 'government. Yet there were no Republicans, as the Federalists asserted,\\n', 'prepared to urge serious modifications in the Constitution. \"If there be\\n', 'any among us who wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican\\n', 'form,\" wrote Jefferson in his first inaugural, \"let them stand\\n', 'undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may\\n', 'be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.\" After reciting the\\n', 'fortunate circumstances of climate, soil, and isolation which made the\\n', 'frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another,\\n', 'shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of\\n', 'industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the\\n', 'bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government; and this is\\n', 'necessary to close the circle of our felicities.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In all this the Republicans had not reckoned with destiny. In a few\\n', 'short years that lay ahead it was their fate to double the territory of\\n', 'the country, making inevitable a continental nation; to give the\\n', 'Constitution a generous interpretation that shocked many a Federalist;\\n', 'to wage war on behalf of American commerce; to reestablish the hated\\n', 'United States Bank; to enact a high protective tariff; to see their\\n', 'Federalist opponents in their turn discredited as nullifiers and\\n', 'provincials; to announce high national doctrines in foreign affairs; and\\n', 'to behold the Constitution exalted and defended against the pretensions\\n', 'of states by a son of old Virginia, John Marshall, Chief Justice of the\\n', 'Supreme Court of the United States.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Expansion and Land Hunger.=--The first of the great measures which\\n', 'drove the Republicans out upon this new national course--the purchase\\n', 'of the Louisiana territory--was the product of circumstances rather than\\n', 'of their deliberate choosing. It was not the lack of land for his\\n', 'cherished farmers that led Jefferson to add such an immense domain to\\n', 'the original possessions of the United States. In the Northwest\\n', 'territory, now embracing Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin,\\n', 'and a portion of Minnesota, settlements were mainly confined to the\\n', 'north bank of the Ohio River. To the south, in Kentucky and Tennessee,\\n', 'where there were more than one hundred thousand white people who had\\n', 'pushed over the mountains from Virginia and the Carolinas, there were\\n', 'still wide reaches of untilled soil. The Alabama and Mississippi regions\\n', 'were vast Indian frontiers of the state of Georgia, unsettled and almost\\n', 'unexplored. Even to the wildest imagination there seemed to be territory\\n', 'enough to satisfy the land hunger of the American people for a century\\n', 'to come.\\n', '\\n', '=The Significance of the Mississippi River.=--At all events the East,\\n', 'then the center of power, saw no good reason for expansion. The planters\\n', 'of the Carolinas, the manufacturers of Pennsylvania, the importers of\\n', 'New York, the shipbuilders of New England, looking to the seaboard and\\n', 'to Europe for trade, refinements, and sometimes their ideas of\\n', 'government, were slow to appreciate the place of the West in national\\n', 'economy. The better educated the Easterners were, the less, it seems,\\n', 'they comprehended the destiny of the nation. Sons of Federalist fathers\\n', 'at Williams College, after a long debate decided by a vote of fifteen to\\n', 'one that the purchase of Louisiana was undesirable.\\n', '\\n', 'On the other hand, the pioneers of Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee,\\n', 'unlearned in books, saw with their own eyes the resources of the\\n', 'wilderness. Many of them had been across the Mississippi and had beheld\\n', 'the rich lands awaiting the plow of the white man. Down the great river\\n', 'they floated their wheat, corn, and bacon to ocean-going ships bound for\\n', 'the ports of the seaboard or for Europe. The land journeys over the\\n', 'mountain barriers with bulky farm produce, they knew from experience,\\n', 'were almost impossible, and costly at best. Nails, bolts of cloth, tea,\\n', 'outlet to the sea by the Mississippi was as essential to the pioneers of\\n', 'the Kentucky region as the harbor of Boston to the merchant princes of\\n', 'that metropolis.\\n', '\\n', '=Louisiana under Spanish Rule.=--For this reason they watched with deep\\n', 'solicitude the fortunes of the Spanish king to whom, at the close of the\\n', \"Seven Years' War, had fallen the Louisiana territory stretching from New\\n\", 'Orleans to the Rocky Mountains. While he controlled the mouth of the\\n', 'Mississippi there was little to fear, for he had neither the army nor\\n', 'the navy necessary to resist any invasion of American trade. Moreover,\\n', 'Washington had been able, by the exercise of great tact, to secure from\\n', 'Spain in 1795 a trading privilege through New Orleans which satisfied\\n', 'the present requirements of the frontiersmen even if it did not allay\\n', 'their fears for the future. So things stood when a swift succession of\\n', 'events altered the whole situation.\\n', '\\n', '=Louisiana Transferred to France.=--In July, 1802, a royal order from\\n', 'Spain instructed the officials at New Orleans to close the port to\\n', 'American produce. About the same time a disturbing rumor, long current,\\n', 'was confirmed--Napoleon had coerced Spain into returning Louisiana to\\n', 'France by a secret treaty signed in 1800. \"The scalers of the Alps and\\n', 'conquerors of Venice\" now looked across the sea for new scenes of\\n', 'through the frontier; expeditions were organized to prevent the landing\\n', 'of the French; and petitions for instant action flooded in upon\\n', 'Jefferson.\\n', '\\n', '=Jefferson Sees the Danger.=--Jefferson, the friend of France and sworn\\n', 'enemy of England, compelled to choose in the interest of America, never\\n', 'winced. \"The cession of Louisiana and the Floridas by Spain to France,\"\\n', 'he wrote to Livingston, the American minister in Paris, \"works sorely on\\n', 'the United States. It completely reverses all the political relations of\\n', 'the United States and will form a new epoch in our political course....\\n', 'There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our\\n', 'natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans through which the produce\\n', 'of three-eighths of our territory must pass to market.... France,\\n', 'placing herself in that door, assumes to us an attitude of defiance.\\n', 'Spain might have retained it quietly for years. Her pacific\\n', 'dispositions, her feeble state would induce her to increase our\\n', 'facilities there.... Not so can it ever be in the hands of France....\\n', 'The day that France takes possession of New Orleans fixes the sentence\\n', 'which is to restrain her forever within her low water mark.... It seals\\n', 'the union of the two nations who in conjunction can maintain exclusive\\n', 'possession of the ocean. From that moment we must marry ourselves to the\\n', 'British fleet and nation.... This is not a state of things we seek or\\n', 'desire. It is one which this measure, if adopted by France, forces on us\\n', 'as necessarily as any other cause by the laws of nature brings on its\\n', 'necessary effect.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Louisiana Purchased.=--Acting on this belief, but apparently seeing\\n', 'only the Mississippi outlet at stake, Jefferson sent his friend, James\\n', 'Monroe, to France with the power to buy New Orleans and West Florida.\\n', 'Before Monroe arrived, the regular minister, Livingston, had already\\n', 'convinced Napoleon that it would be well to sell territory which might\\n', 'be wrested from him at any moment by the British sea power, especially\\n', 'as the war, temporarily stopped by the peace of Amiens, was once more\\n', 'raging in Europe. Wise as he was in his day, Livingston had at first no\\n', 'thought of buying the whole Louisiana country. He was simply dazed when\\n', 'Napoleon offered to sell the entire domain and get rid of the business\\n', 'altogether. Though staggered by the proposal, he and Monroe decided to\\n', 'accept. On April 30, they signed the treaty of cession, agreeing to pay\\n', '$11,250,000 in six per cent bonds and to discharge certain debts due\\n', 'French citizens, making in all approximately fifteen millions. Spain\\n', \"protested, Napoleon's brother fumed, French newspapers objected; but the\\n\", 'deed was done.\\n', '\\n', '=Jefferson and His Constitutional Scruples.=--When the news of this\\n', 'extraordinary event reached the United States, the people were filled\\n', 'with astonishment, and no one was more surprised than Jefferson himself.\\n', 'He had thought of buying New Orleans and West Florida for a small sum,\\n', 'and now a vast domain had been dumped into the lap of the nation. He was\\n', 'puzzled. On looking into the Constitution he found not a line\\n', 'authorizing the purchase of more territory and so he drafted an\\n', 'amendment declaring \"Louisiana, as ceded by France,--a part of the\\n', 'United States.\" He had belabored the Federalists for piling up a big\\n', 'national debt and he could hardly endure the thought of issuing more\\n', 'bonds himself.\\n', '\\n', 'In the midst of his doubts came the news that Napoleon might withdraw\\n', 'from the bargain. Thoroughly alarmed by that, Jefferson pressed the\\n', 'Senate for a ratification of the treaty. He still clung to his original\\n', 'idea that the Constitution did not warrant the purchase; but he lamely\\n', 'acquiesce with satisfaction; confident that the good sense of our\\n', 'country will correct the evil of construction when it shall produce ill\\n', 'effects.\" Thus the stanch advocate of \"strict interpretation\" cut loose\\n', 'from his own doctrine and intrusted the construction of the Constitution\\n', 'to \"the good sense\" of his countrymen.\\n', '\\n', '=The Treaty Ratified.=--This unusual transaction, so favorable to the\\n', 'West, aroused the ire of the seaboard Federalists. Some denounced it as\\n', \"unconstitutional, easily forgetting Hamilton's masterly defense of the\\n\", 'bank, also not mentioned in the Constitution. Others urged that, if \"the\\n', 'howling wilderness\" ever should be settled, it would turn against the\\n', 'East, form new commercial connections, and escape from federal control.\\n', 'Still others protested that the purchase would lead inevitably to the\\n', 'dominance of a \"hotch potch of wild men from the Far West.\" Federalists,\\n', 'who thought \"the broad back of America\" could readily bear Hamilton\\'s\\n', 'consolidated debt, now went into agonies over a bond issue of less than\\n', \"one-sixth of that amount. But in vain. Jefferson's party with a high\\n\", 'hand carried the day. The Senate, after hearing the Federalist protest,\\n', 'ratified the treaty. In December, 1803, the French flag was hauled down\\n', 'from the old government buildings in New Orleans and the Stars and\\n', 'Stripes were hoisted as a sign that the land of Coronado, De Soto,\\n', 'Marquette, and La Salle had passed forever to the United States.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'By a single stroke, the original territory of the United States was more\\n', 'than doubled. While the boundaries of the purchase were uncertain, it is\\n', 'safe to say that the Louisiana territory included what is now Arkansas,\\n', 'Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and large\\n', 'portions of Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, Colorado, Montana, and\\n', 'Wyoming. The farm lands that the friends of \"a little America\" on the\\n', 'seacoast declared a hopeless wilderness were, within a hundred years,\\n', 'fully occupied and valued at nearly seven billion dollars--almost five\\n', 'hundred times the price paid to Napoleon.\\n', '\\n', '=Western Explorations.=--Having taken the fateful step, Jefferson wisely\\n', 'began to make the most of it. He prepared for the opening of the new\\n', 'country by sending the Lewis and Clark expedition to explore it,\\n', 'discover its resources, and lay out an overland route through the\\n', 'Missouri Valley and across the Great Divide to the Pacific. The story of\\n', 'this mighty exploit, which began in the spring of 1804 and ended in the\\n', 'autumn of 1806, was set down with skill and pains in the journal of\\n', 'Lewis and Clark; when published even in a short form, it invited the\\n', 'forward-looking men of the East to take thought about the western\\n', 'empire. At the same time Zebulon Pike, in a series of journeys, explored\\n', 'the sources of the Mississippi River and penetrated the Spanish\\n', 'territories of the far Southwest. Thus scouts and pioneers continued the\\n', 'work of diplomats.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The English and French Blockades.=--In addition to bringing Louisiana\\n', 'to the United States, the reopening of the European War in 1803, after a\\n', 'short lull, renewed in an acute form the commercial difficulties that\\n', 'had plagued the country all during the administrations of Washington and\\n', \"Adams. The Republicans were now plunged into the hornets' nest. The\\n\", 'party whose ardent spirits had burned Jay in effigy, stoned Hamilton for\\n', \"defending his treaty, jeered Washington's proclamation of neutrality,\\n\", 'and spoken bitterly of \"timid traders,\" could no longer take refuge in\\n', 'criticism. It had to act.\\n', '\\n', 'Its troubles took a serious turn in 1806. England, in a determined\\n', 'effort to bring France to her knees by starvation, declared the coast of\\n', 'Europe blockaded from Brest to the mouth of the Elbe River. Napoleon\\n', 'retaliated by his Berlin Decree of November, 1806, blockading the\\n', 'British Isles--a measure terrifying to American ship owners whose\\n', 'vessels were liable to seizure by any French rover, though Napoleon had\\n', 'no navy to make good his proclamation. Great Britain countered with a\\n', 'still more irritating decree--the Orders in Council of 1807. It modified\\n', 'its blockade, but in so doing merely authorized American ships not\\n', 'carrying munitions of war to complete their voyage to the Continent, on\\n', 'condition of their stopping at a British port, securing a license, and\\n', 'paying a tax. This, responded Napoleon, was the height of insolence, and\\n', 'he denounced it as a gross violation of international law. He then\\n', 'closed the circle of American troubles by issuing his Milan Decree of\\n', 'December, 1807. This order declared that any ship which complied with\\n', 'the British rules would be subject to seizure and confiscation by French\\n', 'authorities.\\n', '\\n', '=The Impressment of Seamen.=--That was not all. Great Britain, in dire\\n', 'need of men for her navy, adopted the practice of stopping American\\n', 'ships, searching them, and carrying away British-born sailors found on\\n', 'board. British sailors were so badly treated, so cruelly flogged for\\n', 'trivial causes, and so meanly fed that they fled in crowds to the\\n', 'American marine. In many cases it was difficult to tell whether seamen\\n', 'were English or American. They spoke the same language, so that language\\n', 'was no test. Rovers on the deep and stragglers in the ports of both\\n', 'countries, they frequently had no papers to show their nativity.\\n', 'Moreover, Great Britain held to the old rule--\"Once an Englishman,\\n', 'always an Englishman\"--a doctrine rejected by the United States in\\n', 'favor of the principle that a man could choose the nation to which he\\n', 'would give allegiance. British sea captains, sometimes by mistake, and\\n', 'often enough with reckless indifference, carried away into servitude in\\n', 'their own navy genuine American citizens. The process itself, even when\\n', 'executed with all the civilities of law, was painful enough, for it\\n', 'meant that American ships were forced to \"come to,\" and compelled to\\n', 'rest submissively under British guns until the searching party had pried\\n', 'into records, questioned seamen, seized and handcuffed victims. Saints\\n', 'could not have done this work without raising angry passions, and only\\n', 'saints could have endured it with patience and fortitude.\\n', '\\n', 'Had the enactment of the scenes been confined to the high seas and\\n', 'knowledge of them to rumors and newspaper stories, American resentment\\n', 'might not have been so intense; but many a search and seizure was made\\n', 'in sight of land. British and French vessels patrolled the coasts,\\n', 'firing on one another and chasing one another in American waters within\\n', 'the three-mile limit. When, in the summer of 1807, the American frigate\\n', '_Chesapeake_ refused to surrender men alleged to be deserters from King\\n', \"George's navy, the British warship _Leopard_ opened fire, killing three\\n\", 'men and wounding eighteen more--an act which even the British ministry\\n', 'could hardly excuse. If the French were less frequently the offenders,\\n', 'it was not because of their tenderness about American rights but because\\n', 'so few of their ships escaped the hawk-eyed British navy to operate in\\n', 'American waters.\\n', '\\n', '=The Losses in American Commerce.=--This high-handed conduct on the part\\n', 'of European belligerents was very injurious to American trade. By their\\n', 'enterprise, American shippers had become the foremost carriers on the\\n', 'Atlantic Ocean. In a decade they had doubled the tonnage of American\\n', 'merchant ships under the American flag, taking the place of the French\\n', 'marine when Britain swept that from the seas, and supplying Britain with\\n', 'the sinews of war for the contest with the Napoleonic empire. The\\n', 'American shipping engaged in foreign trade embraced 363,110 tons in\\n', '1791; 669,921 tons in 1800; and almost 1,000,000 tons in 1810. Such was\\n', 'the enterprise attacked by the British and French decrees. American\\n', 'ships bound for Great Britain were liable to be captured by French\\n', 'privateers which, in spite of the disasters of the Nile and Trafalgar,\\n', 'ranged the seas. American ships destined for the Continent, if they\\n', 'failed to stop at British ports and pay tribute, were in great danger of\\n', 'capture by the sleepless British navy and its swarm of auxiliaries.\\n', 'American sea captains who, in fear of British vengeance, heeded the\\n', 'Orders in Council and paid the tax were almost certain to fall a prey to\\n', 'French vengeance, for the French were vigorous in executing the Milan\\n', 'Decree.\\n', '\\n', \"=Jefferson's Policy.=--The President's dilemma was distressing. Both the\\n\", 'belligerents in Europe were guilty of depredations on American commerce.\\n', 'War on both of them was out of the question. War on France was\\n', 'impossible because she had no territory on this side of the water which\\n', 'could be reached by American troops and her naval forces had been\\n', 'shattered at the battles of the Nile and Trafalgar. War on Great\\n', \"Britain, a power which Jefferson's followers feared and distrusted, was\\n\", \"disliked war's brazen clamor; a man of kindly spirit, he was startled at\\n\", 'the death and destruction which it brought in its train. So for the\\n', 'eight years Jefferson steered an even course, suggesting measure after\\n', 'measure with a view to avoiding bloodshed. He sent, it is true,\\n', 'Commodore Preble in 1803 to punish Mediterranean pirates preying upon\\n', 'American commerce; but a great war he evaded with passionate\\n', 'earnestness, trying in its place every other expedient to protect\\n', 'American rights.\\n', '\\n', '=The Embargo and Non-intercourse Acts.=--In 1806, Congress passed and\\n', 'Jefferson approved a non-importation act closing American ports to\\n', 'certain products from British dominions--a measure intended as a club\\n', \"over the British government's head. This law, failing in its purpose,\\n\", 'Jefferson proposed and Congress adopted in December, 1807, the Embargo\\n', 'Act forbidding all vessels to leave American harbors for foreign ports.\\n', 'France and England were to be brought to terms by cutting off their\\n', 'supplies.\\n', '\\n', 'The result of the embargo was pathetic. England and France refused to\\n', 'give up search and seizure. American ship owners who, lured by huge\\n', 'profits, had formerly been willing to take the risk were now restrained\\n', 'by law to their home ports. Every section suffered. The South and West\\n', 'found their markets for cotton, rice, tobacco, corn, and bacon\\n', 'curtailed. Thus they learned by bitter experience the national\\n', 'significance of commerce. Ship masters, ship builders, longshoremen, and\\n', 'sailors were thrown out of employment while the prices of foreign goods\\n', 'doubled. Those who obeyed the law were ruined; violators of the law\\n', 'smuggled goods into Canada and Florida for shipment abroad.\\n', '\\n', \"Jefferson's friends accepted the medicine with a wry face as the only\\n\", 'alternative to supine submission or open war. His opponents, without\\n', 'offering any solution of their own, denounced it as a contemptible plan\\n', 'that brought neither relief nor honor. Beset by the clamor that arose on\\n', \"all sides, Congress, in the closing days of Jefferson's administration,\\n\", 'repealed the Embargo law and substituted a Non-intercourse act\\n', 'forbidding trade with England and France while permitting it with other\\n', 'countries--a measure equally futile in staying the depredations on\\n', 'American shipping.\\n', '\\n', '=Jefferson Retires in Favor of Madison.=--Jefferson, exhausted by\\n', 'endless wrangling and wounded, as Washington had been, by savage\\n', 'criticism, welcomed March 4, 1809. His friends urged him to \"stay by the\\n', 'ship\" and accept a third term. He declined, saying that election for\\n', \"life might result from repeated reelection. In following Washington's\\n\", 'course and defending it on principle, he set an example to all his\\n', 'successors, making the \"third term doctrine\" a part of American\\n', 'unwritten law.\\n', '\\n', 'His intimate friend, James Madison, to whom he turned over the burdens\\n', 'of his high office was, like himself, a man of peace. Madison had been a\\n', 'leader since the days of the Revolution, but in legislative halls and\\n', 'council chambers, not on the field of battle. Small in stature,\\n', 'sensitive in feelings, studious in habits, he was no man for the rough\\n', 'and tumble of practical politics. He had taken a prominent and\\n', 'distinguished part in the framing and the adoption of the Constitution.\\n', \"He had served in the first Congress as a friend of Hamilton's measures.\\n\", \"Later he attached himself to Jefferson's fortunes and served for eight\\n\", 'years as his first counselor, the Secretary of State. The principles of\\n', 'the Constitution, which he had helped to make and interpret, he was now\\n', 'as President called upon to apply in one of the most perplexing moments\\n', 'in all American history. In keeping with his own traditions and\\n', 'following in the footsteps of Jefferson, he vainly tried to solve the\\n', 'foreign problem by negotiation.\\n', '\\n', '=The Trend of Events.=--Whatever difficulties Madison had in making up\\n', 'his mind on war and peace were settled by events beyond his own control.\\n', 'In the spring of 1811, a British frigate held up an American ship near\\n', 'the harbor of New York and impressed a seaman alleged to be an American\\n', 'citizen. Burning with resentment, the captain of the _President_, an\\n', 'American warship, acting under orders, poured several broadsides into\\n', 'the _Little Belt_, a British sloop, suspected of being the guilty party.\\n', 'The British also encouraged the Indian chief Tecumseh, who welded\\n', 'together the Indians of the Northwest under British protection and gave\\n', 'signs of restlessness presaging a revolt. This sent a note of alarm\\n', 'along the frontier that was not checked even when, in November,\\n', \"Tecumseh's men were badly beaten at Tippecanoe by William Henry\\n\", 'Harrison. The Indians stood in the way of the advancing frontier, and it\\n', 'seemed to the pioneers that, without support from the British in Canada,\\n', 'the Red Men would soon be subdued.\\n', '\\n', '=Clay and Calhoun.=--While events were moving swiftly and rumors were\\n', 'flying thick and fast, the mastery of the government passed from the\\n', 'uncertain hands of Madison to a party of ardent young men in Congress,\\n', 'dubbed \"Young Republicans,\" under the leadership of two members destined\\n', 'to be mighty figures in American history: Henry Clay of Kentucky and\\n', 'folly, that \"the militia of Kentucky alone are competent to place\\n', 'Montreal and Upper Canada at your feet.\" The latter with a light heart\\n', 'spoke of conquering Canada in a four weeks\\' campaign. \"It must not be\\n', 'inferred,\" says Channing, \"that in advocating conquest, the Westerners\\n', 'were actuated merely by desire for land; they welcomed war because they\\n', '\\n', 'thought it would be the easiest way to abate Indian troubles. The\\n', 'savages were supported by the fur-trading interests that centred at\\n', 'Quebec and London.... The Southerners on their part wished for Florida\\n', 'and they thought that the conquest of Canada would obviate some Northern\\n', 'opposition to this acquisition of slave territory.\" While Clay and\\n', 'Calhoun, spokesmen of the West and South, were not unmindful of what\\n', 'Napoleon had done to American commerce, they knew that their followers\\n', 'still remembered with deep gratitude the aid of the French in the war\\n', 'still on the throne, could be readily blown into flame.\\n', '\\n', '=Madison Accepts War as Inevitable.=--The conduct of the British\\n', 'ministers with whom Madison had to deal did little to encourage him in\\n', 'adhering to the policy of \"watchful waiting.\" One of them, a high Tory,\\n', 'believed that all Americans were alike \"except that a few are less\\n', 'knaves than others\" and his methods were colored by his belief. On the\\n', 'recall of this minister the British government selected another no less\\n', 'high and mighty in his principles and opinions. So Madison became\\n', 'thoroughly discouraged about the outcome of pacific measures. When the\\n', 'pressure from Congress upon him became too heavy, he gave way, signing\\n', 'on June 18, 1812, the declaration of war on Great Britain. In\\n', 'proclaiming hostilities, the administration set forth the causes which\\n', 'justified the declaration; namely, the British had been encouraging the\\n', 'Indians to attack American citizens on the frontier; they had ruined\\n', 'American trade by blockades; they had insulted the American flag by\\n', 'stopping and searching our ships; they had illegally seized American\\n', 'sailors and driven them into the British navy.\\n', '\\n', '=The Course of the War.=--The war lasted for nearly three years without\\n', 'bringing victory to either side. The surrender of Detroit by General\\n', 'Hull to the British and the failure of the American invasion of Canada\\n', \"were offset by Perry's victory on Lake Erie and a decisive blow\\n\", 'administered to British designs for an invasion of New York by way of\\n', 'Plattsburgh. The triumph of Jackson at New Orleans helped to atone for\\n', 'the humiliation suffered in the burning of the Capitol by the British.\\n', 'The stirring deeds of the _Constitution_, the _United States_, and the\\n', '_Argus_ on the seas, the heroic death of Lawrence and the victories of a\\n', 'hundred privateers furnished consolation for those who suffered from the\\n', 'iron blockade finally established by the British government when it came\\n', 'to appreciate the gravity of the situation. While men love the annals of\\n', 'the sea, they will turn to the running battles, the narrow escapes, and\\n', 'the reckless daring of American sailors in that naval contest with Great\\n', 'Britain.\\n', '\\n', 'All this was exciting but it was inconclusive. In fact, never was a\\n', 'government less prepared than was that of the United States in 1812. It\\n', 'had neither the disciplined troops, the ships of war, nor the supplies\\n', 'required by the magnitude of the military task. It was fortune that\\n', 'favored the American cause. Great Britain, harassed, worn, and\\n', 'financially embarrassed by nearly twenty years of fighting in Europe,\\n', 'was in no mood to gather her forces for a titanic effort in America even\\n', 'after Napoleon was overthrown and sent into exile at Elba in the spring\\n', 'of 1814. War clouds still hung on the European horizon and the conflict\\n', 'temporarily halted did again break out. To be rid of American anxieties\\n', 'and free for European eventualities, England was ready to settle with\\n', 'the United States, especially as that could be done without conceding\\n', 'anything or surrendering any claims.\\n', '\\n', '=The Treaty of Peace.=--Both countries were in truth sick of a war that\\n', 'offered neither glory nor profit. Having indulged in the usual\\n', 'diplomatic skirmishing, they sent representatives to Ghent to discuss\\n', 'terms of peace. After long negotiations an agreement was reached on\\n', \"Christmas eve, 1814, a few days before Jackson's victory at New Orleans.\\n\", 'When the treaty reached America the people were surprised to find that\\n', 'it said nothing about the seizure of American sailors, the destruction\\n', 'of American trade, the searching of American ships, or the support of\\n', 'Indians on the frontier. Nevertheless, we are told, the people \"passed\\n', 'from gloom to glory\" when the news of peace arrived. The bells were\\n', 'rung; schools were closed; flags were displayed; and many a rousing\\n', 'toast was drunk in tavern and private home. The rejoicing could\\n', 'continue. With Napoleon definitely beaten at Waterloo in June, 1815,\\n', 'Great Britain had no need to impress sailors, search ships, and\\n', 'confiscate American goods bound to the Continent. Once more the terrible\\n', 'sea power sank into the background and the ocean was again white with\\n', 'the sails of merchantmen.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"=The Federalists Discredited.=--By a strange turn of fortune's wheel,\\n\", 'the party of Hamilton, Washington, Adams, the party of the grand nation,\\n', 'became the party of provincialism and nullification. New England,\\n', 'finding its shipping interests crippled in the European conflict and\\n', 'then penalized by embargoes, opposed the declaration of war on Great\\n', 'Britain, which meant the completion of the ruin already begun. In the\\n', 'course of the struggle, the Federalist leaders came perilously near to\\n', 'treason in their efforts to hamper the government of the United States;\\n', 'and in their desperation they fell back upon the doctrine of\\n', 'nullification so recently condemned by them when it came from Kentucky.\\n', 'The Senate of Massachusetts, while the war was in progress, resolved\\n', 'that it was waged \"without justifiable cause,\" and refused to approve\\n', 'military and naval projects not connected with \"the defense of our\\n', 'nothing but a treaty among sovereign states, that states could decide\\n', 'for themselves the question of obeying federal law, and that armed\\n', 'resistance under the banner of a state would not be rebellion or\\n', 'treason. The general assembly of Connecticut reminded the administration\\n', 'at Washington that \"the state of Connecticut is a free, sovereign, and\\n', 'independent state.\" Gouverneur Morris, a member of the convention which\\n', 'had drafted the Constitution, suggested the holding of another\\n', 'conference to consider whether the Northern states should remain in the\\n', 'union.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old cartoon_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'In October, 1814, a convention of delegates from Connecticut,\\n', 'Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and certain counties of New Hampshire and\\n', 'Vermont was held at Hartford, on the call of Massachusetts. The counsels\\n', 'of the extremists were rejected but the convention solemnly went on\\n', 'record to the effect that acts of Congress in violation of the\\n', 'Constitution are void; that in cases of deliberate, dangerous, and\\n', 'palpable infractions the state is duty bound to interpose its authority\\n', 'for the protection of its citizens; and that when emergencies occur the\\n', 'states must be their own judges and execute their own decisions. Thus\\n', 'New England answered the challenge of Calhoun and Clay. Fortunately its\\n', 'actions were not as rash as its words. The Hartford convention merely\\n', 'proposed certain amendments to the Constitution and adjourned. At the\\n', 'close of the war, its proposals vanished harmlessly; but the men who\\n', 'made them were hopelessly discredited.\\n', '\\n', '=The Second United States Bank.=--In driving the Federalists towards\\n', 'nullification and waging a national war themselves, the Republicans lost\\n', 'all their old taint of provincialism. Moreover, in turning to measures\\n', 'of reconstruction called forth by the war, they resorted to the national\\n', 'devices of the Federalists. In 1816, they chartered for a period of\\n', 'twenty years a second United States Bank--the institution which\\n', 'Jefferson and Madison once had condemned as unsound and\\n', 'unconstitutional. The Constitution remained unchanged; times and\\n', 'circumstances had changed. Calhoun dismissed the vexed question of\\n', 'constitutionality with a scant reference to an ancient dispute, while\\n', 'Madison set aside his scruples and signed the bill.\\n', '\\n', '=The Protective Tariff of 1816.=--The Republicans supplemented the Bank\\n', 'by another Federalist measure--a high protective tariff. Clay viewed it\\n', 'as the beginning of his \"American system\" of protection. Calhoun\\n', 'defended it on national principles. For this sudden reversal of policy\\n', 'the young Republicans were taunted by some of their older party\\n', 'colleagues with betraying the \"agricultural interest\" that Jefferson had\\n', 'fostered; but Calhoun refused to listen to their criticisms. \"When the\\n', 'seas are open,\" he said, \"the produce of the South may pour anywhere\\n', 'into the markets of the Old World.... What are the effects of a war with\\n', 'a maritime power--with England? Our commerce annihilated ... our\\n', 'agriculture cut off from its accustomed markets, the surplus of the\\n', 'farmer perishes on his hands.... The recent war fell with peculiar\\n', 'pressure on the growers of cotton and tobacco and the other great\\n', 'staples of the country; and the same state of things will recur in the\\n', 'event of another war unless prevented by the foresight of this body....\\n', 'When our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection, as they soon\\n', 'will be under the fostering care of the government, we shall no longer\\n', 'experience these evils.\" With the Republicans nationalized, the\\n', 'Federalist party, as an organization, disappeared after a crushing\\n', 'defeat in the presidential campaign of 1816.\\n', '\\n', '=Monroe and the Florida Purchase.=--To the victor in that political\\n', 'contest, James Monroe of Virginia, fell two tasks of national\\n', 'importance, adding to the prestige of the whole country and deepening\\n', 'the sense of patriotism that weaned men away from mere allegiance to\\n', 'states. The first of these was the purchase of Florida from Spain. The\\n', 'acquisition of Louisiana let the Mississippi flow \"unvexed to the sea\";\\n', 'but it left all the states east of the river cut off from the Gulf,\\n', 'affording them ground for discontent akin to that which had moved the\\n', 'pioneers of Kentucky to action a generation earlier. The uncertainty as\\n', 'to the boundaries of Louisiana gave the United States a claim to West\\n', 'Florida, setting on foot a movement for occupation. The Florida swamps\\n', 'were a basis for Indian marauders who periodically swept into the\\n', 'frontier settlements, and hiding places for runaway slaves. Thus the\\n', 'sanction of international law was given to punitive expeditions into\\n', 'alien territory.\\n', '\\n', 'The pioneer leaders stood waiting for the signal. It came. President\\n', 'Monroe, on the occasion of an Indian outbreak, ordered General Jackson\\n', 'to seize the offenders, in the Floridas, if necessary. The high-spirited\\n', 'warrior, taking this as a hint that he was to occupy the coveted region,\\n', 'replied that, if possession was the object of the invasion, he could\\n', 'occupy the Floridas within sixty days. Without waiting for an answer to\\n', 'this letter, he launched his expedition, and in the spring of 1818 was\\n', \"master of the Spanish king's domain to the south.\\n\", '\\n', 'There was nothing for the king to do but to make the best of the\\n', 'inevitable by ceding the Floridas to the United States in return for\\n', 'five million dollars to be paid to American citizens having claims\\n', \"against Spain. On Washington's birthday, 1819, the treaty was signed. It\\n\", 'ceded the Floridas to the United States and defined the boundary between\\n', 'Mexico and the United States by drawing a line from the mouth of the\\n', 'Sabine River in a northwesterly direction to the Pacific. On this\\n', 'occasion even Monroe, former opponent of the Constitution, forgot to\\n', 'inquire whether new territory could be constitutionally acquired and\\n', 'incorporated into the American union. The Republicans seemed far away\\n', 'from the days of \"strict construction.\" And Jefferson still lived!\\n', '\\n', '=The Monroe Doctrine.=--Even more effective in fashioning the national\\n', \"idea was Monroe's enunciation of the famous doctrine that bears his\\n\", 'name. The occasion was another European crisis. During the Napoleonic\\n', 'upheaval and the years of dissolution that ensued, the Spanish colonies\\n', 'in America, following the example set by their English neighbors in\\n', '1776, declared their independence. Unable to conquer them alone, the\\n', 'king of Spain turned for help to the friendly powers of Europe that\\n', 'looked upon revolution and republics with undisguised horror.\\n', '\\n', 'sympathy. Three of them, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, under the\\n', 'into a Holy Alliance to sustain by reciprocal service the autocratic\\n', 'principle in government. Although the effusive, almost maudlin, language\\n', 'of the treaty did not express their purpose explicitly, the Alliance was\\n', 'later regarded as a mere union of monarchs to prevent the rise and\\n', 'growth of popular government.\\n', '\\n', 'The American people thought their worst fears confirmed when, in 1822, a\\n', 'conference of delegates from Russia, Austria, Prussia, and France met at\\n', 'Verona to consider, among other things, revolutions that had just broken\\n', 'out in Spain and Italy. The spirit of the conference is reflected in the\\n', 'first article of the agreement reached by the delegates: \"The high\\n', 'contracting powers, being convinced that the system of representative\\n', 'government is equally incompatible with the monarchical principle and\\n', 'the maxim of the sovereignty of the people with the divine right,\\n', 'mutually engage in the most solemn manner to use all their efforts to\\n', 'put an end to the system of representative government in whatever\\n', 'country it may exist in Europe and to prevent its being introduced in\\n', 'those countries where it is not yet known.\" The Czar, who incidentally\\n', 'coveted the west coast of North America, proposed to send an army to aid\\n', 'the king of Spain in his troubles at home, thus preparing the way for\\n', 'intervention in Spanish America. It was material weakness not want of\\n', 'spirit, that prevented the grand union of monarchs from making open war\\n', 'on popular government.\\n', '\\n', 'England refused to cooperate. English merchants had built up a large\\n', 'trade with the independent Latin-American colonies and they protested\\n', 'against the restoration of Spanish sovereignty, which meant a renewal of\\n', \"Spain's former trade monopoly. Moreover, divine right doctrines had been\\n\", 'laid to rest in England and the representative principle thoroughly\\n', 'established. Already there were signs of the coming democratic flood\\n', 'which was soon to carry the first reform bill of 1832, extending the\\n', 'suffrage, and sweep on to even greater achievements. British statesmen,\\n', 'therefore, had to be cautious. In such circumstances, instead of\\n', 'cooperating with the autocrats of Russia, Austria, and Prussia, they\\n', 'turned to the minister of the United States in London. The British prime\\n', 'minister, Canning, proposed that the two countries join in declaring\\n', 'their unwillingness to see the Spanish colonies transferred to any other\\n', 'power.\\n', '\\n', 'took up the suggestion with Madison and Jefferson as well as with his\\n', 'Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams. They favored the plan. Jefferson\\n', 'said: \"One nation, most of all, could disturb us in this pursuit [of\\n', 'freedom]; she now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us in it. By\\n', 'acceding to her proposition we detach her from the bands, bring her\\n', 'mighty weight into the scale of free government and emancipate a\\n', 'continent at one stroke.... With her on our side we need not fear the\\n', 'whole world. With her then we should most sedulously cherish a cordial\\n', 'friendship.\"\\n', '\\n', 'friends, President Monroe embodied in his message to Congress, on\\n', 'December 2, 1823, a statement of principles now famous throughout the\\n', 'world as the Monroe Doctrine. To the autocrats of Europe he announced\\n', 'that he would regard \"any attempt on their part to extend their system\\n', 'to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety.\"\\n', 'While he did not propose to interfere with existing colonies dependent\\n', 'on European powers, he ranged himself squarely on the side of those that\\n', 'had declared their independence. Any attempt by a European power to\\n', 'oppress them or control their destiny in any manner he characterized as\\n', '\"a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States.\"\\n', 'Referring in another part of his message to a recent claim which the\\n', 'Czar had made to the Pacific coast, President Monroe warned the Old\\n', 'World that \"the American continents, by the free and independent\\n', 'condition which they have assumed and maintained, are henceforth not to\\n', 'be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European\\n', 'powers.\" The effect of this declaration was immediate and profound. Men\\n', 'whose political horizon had been limited to a community or state were\\n', 'led to consider their nation as a great power among the sovereignties of\\n', 'the earth, taking its part in shaping their international relations.\\n', '\\n', '=The Missouri Compromise.=--Respecting one other important measure of\\n', 'this period, the Republicans also took a broad view of their obligations\\n', 'under the Constitution; namely, the Missouri Compromise. It is true,\\n', 'they insisted on the admission of Missouri as a slave state, balanced\\n', 'against the free state of Maine; but at the same time they assented to\\n', 'the prohibition of slavery in the Louisiana territory north of the line\\n', \"36 o 30'. During the debate on the subject an extreme view had been\\n\", 'presented, to the effect that Congress had no constitutional warrant for\\n', 'abolishing slavery in the territories. The precedent of the Northwest\\n', 'Ordinance, ratified by Congress in 1789, seemed a conclusive answer from\\n', 'practice to this contention; but Monroe submitted the issue to his\\n', 'cabinet, which included Calhoun of South Carolina, Crawford of Georgia,\\n', 'and Wirt of Virginia, all presumably adherents to the Jeffersonian\\n', 'principle of strict construction. He received in reply a unanimous\\n', 'verdict to the effect that Congress did have the power to prohibit\\n', 'slavery in the territories governed by it. Acting on this advice he\\n', 'approved, on March 6, 1820, the bill establishing freedom north of the\\n', 'compromise line. This generous interpretation of the powers of Congress\\n', 'stood for nearly forty years, until repudiated by the Supreme Court in\\n', 'the Dred Scott case.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=John Marshall, the Nationalist.=--The Republicans in the lower ranges\\n', 'of state politics, who did not catch the grand national style of their\\n', 'leaders charged with responsibilities in the national field, were\\n', 'assisted in their education by a Federalist from the Old Dominion, John\\n', 'Marshall, who, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United\\n', 'States from 1801 to 1835, lost no occasion to exalt the Constitution\\n', 'above the claims of the provinces. No differences of opinion as to his\\n', 'political views have ever led even his warmest opponents to deny his\\n', 'superb abilities or his sincere devotion to the national idea. All will\\n', 'likewise agree that for talents, native and acquired, he was an ornament\\n', 'to the humble democracy that brought him forth. His whole career was\\n', 'American. Born on the frontier of Virginia, reared in a log cabin,\\n', 'granted only the barest rudiments of education, inured to hardship and\\n', 'rough life, he rose by masterly efforts to the highest judicial honor\\n', 'America can bestow.\\n', '\\n', 'On him the bitter experience of the Revolution and of later days made a\\n', 'lasting impression. He was no \"summer patriot.\" He had been a soldier in\\n', 'the Revolutionary army. He had suffered with Washington at Valley Forge.\\n', 'He had seen his comrades in arms starving and freezing because the\\n', 'Continental Congress had neither the power nor the inclination to force\\n', 'the states to do their full duty. To him the Articles of Confederation\\n', 'were the symbol of futility. Into the struggle for the formation of the\\n', 'Constitution and its ratification in Virginia he had thrown himself with\\n', 'the ardor of a soldier. Later, as a member of Congress, a representative\\n', 'to France, and Secretary of State, he had aided the Federalists in\\n', 'establishing the new government. When at length they were driven from\\n', 'power in the executive and legislative branches of the government, he\\n', 'was chosen for their last stronghold, the Supreme Court. By historic\\n', 'irony he administered the oath of office to his bitterest enemy, Thomas\\n', 'Jefferson; and, long after the author of the Declaration of Independence\\n', 'had retired to private life, the stern Chief Justice continued to\\n', 'announce the old Federalist principles from the Supreme Bench.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'his high office only two years when he laid down for the first time in\\n', 'the name of the entire Court the doctrine that the judges have the power\\n', 'to declare an act of Congress null and void when in their opinion it\\n', 'violates the Constitution. This power was not expressly conferred on the\\n', 'Court. Though many able men held that the judicial branch of the\\n', 'government enjoyed it, the principle was not positively established\\n', 'rendering the opinion of the Court, Marshall cited no precedents. He\\n', 'sought no foundations for his argument in ancient history. He rested it\\n', 'on the general nature of the American system. The Constitution, ran his\\n', 'reasoning, is the supreme law of the land; it limits and binds all who\\n', 'act in the name of the United States; it limits the powers of Congress\\n', 'and defines the rights of citizens. If Congress can ignore its\\n', 'limitations and trespass upon the rights of citizens, Marshall argued,\\n', 'then the Constitution disappears and Congress is supreme. Since,\\n', 'however, the Constitution is supreme and superior to Congress, it is the\\n', 'duty of judges, under their oath of office, to sustain it against\\n', 'measures which violate it. Therefore, from the nature of the American\\n', 'constitutional system the courts must declare null and void all acts\\n', 'closed, \"is void and the courts as well as other departments are bound\\n', 'by that instrument.\" From that day to this the practice of federal and\\n', 'state courts in passing upon the constitutionality of laws has remained\\n', 'unshaken.\\n', '\\n', 'This doctrine was received by Jefferson and many of his followers with\\n', 'consternation. If the idea was sound, he exclaimed, \"then indeed is our\\n', 'Constitution a complete _felo de se_ [legally, a suicide]. For,\\n', 'intending to establish three departments, coordinate and independent\\n', 'that they might check and balance one another, it has given, according\\n', 'to this opinion, to one of them alone the right to prescribe rules for\\n', 'the government of the others, and to that one, too, which is unelected\\n', 'by and independent of the nation.... The Constitution, on this\\n', 'hypothesis, is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary which\\n', 'they may twist and shape into any form they please. It should be\\n', 'remembered, as an axiom of eternal truth in politics, that whatever\\n', 'independent of a king or executive alone is a good thing; but\\n', 'independence of the will of the nation is a solecism, at least in a\\n', 'republican government.\" But Marshall was mighty and his view prevailed,\\n', \"though from time to time other men, clinging to Jefferson's opinion,\\n\", 'likewise opposed the exercise by the Courts of the high power of passing\\n', 'upon the constitutionality of acts of Congress.\\n', '\\n', '=Acts of State Legislatures Declared Unconstitutional.=--Had Marshall\\n', 'stopped with annulling an act of Congress, he would have heard less\\n', 'criticism from Republican quarters; but, with the same firmness, he set\\n', 'aside acts of state legislatures as well, whenever, in his opinion, they\\n', 'violated the federal Constitution. In 1810, in the case of Fletcher\\n', 'state that it was not sovereign, but \"a part of a large empire, ... a\\n', 'member of the American union; and that union has a constitution ...\\n', 'which imposes limits to the legislatures of the several states.\" In the\\n', 'act of the Maryland legislature designed to paralyze the branches of the\\n', 'United States Bank established in that state. In the same year, in the\\n', 'still more memorable Dartmouth College case, he annulled an act of the\\n', 'New Hampshire legislature which infringed upon the charter received by\\n', 'the college from King George long before. That charter, he declared, was\\n', 'a contract between the state and the college, which the legislature\\n', 'under the federal Constitution could not impair. Two years later he\\n', 'stirred the wrath of Virginia by summoning her to the bar of the Supreme\\n', 'Court to answer in a case in which the validity of one of her laws was\\n', 'involved and then justified his action in a powerful opinion rendered in\\n', '\\n', 'All these decisions aroused the legislatures of the states. They passed\\n', 'sheaves of resolutions protesting and condemning; but Marshall never\\n', 'turned and never stayed. The Constitution of the United States, he\\n', 'fairly thundered at them, is the supreme law of the land; the Supreme\\n', 'Court is the proper tribunal to pass finally upon the validity of the\\n', 'laws of the states; and \"those sovereignties,\" far from possessing the\\n', 'right of review and nullification, are irrevocably bound by the\\n', 'decisions of that Court. This was strong medicine for the authors of the\\n', 'Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions and for the members of the Hartford\\n', 'convention; but they had to take it.\\n', '\\n', '=The Doctrine of Implied Powers.=--While restraining Congress in the\\n', 'Marbury case and the state legislatures in a score of cases, Marshall\\n', 'also laid the judicial foundation for a broad and liberal view of the\\n', 'Constitution as opposed to narrow and strict construction. In McCulloch\\n', 'in such a way as to confer upon Congress a wide range of \"implied\\n', 'powers\" in addition to their express powers. That case involved, among\\n', 'other things, the question whether the act establishing the second\\n', 'United States Bank was authorized by the Constitution. Marshall answered\\n', 'in the affirmative. Congress, ran his reasoning, has large powers over\\n', 'taxation and the currency; a bank is of appropriate use in the exercise\\n', 'of these enumerated powers; and therefore, though not absolutely\\n', 'necessary, a bank is entirely proper and constitutional. \"With respect\\n', 'to the means by which the powers that the Constitution confers are to be\\n', 'carried into execution,\" he said, Congress must be allowed the\\n', 'discretion which \"will enable that body to perform the high duties\\n', 'assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people.\" In short,\\n', 'the Constitution of the United States is not a strait jacket but a\\n', 'flexible instrument vesting in Congress the powers necessary to meet\\n', 'national problems as they arise. In delivering this opinion Marshall\\n', 'used language almost identical with that employed by Lincoln when,\\n', 'standing on the battle field of a war waged to preserve the nation, he\\n', 'said that \"a government of the people, by the people, for the people\\n', 'shall not perish from the earth.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'During the strenuous period between the establishment of American\\n', 'independence and the advent of Jacksonian democracy the great American\\n', 'experiment was under the direction of the men who had launched it. All\\n', 'the Presidents in that period, except John Quincy Adams, had taken part\\n', 'in the Revolution. James Madison, the chief author of the Constitution,\\n', 'lived until 1836. This age, therefore, was the \"age of the fathers.\" It\\n', 'saw the threatened ruin of the country under the Articles of\\n', 'Confederation, the formation of the Constitution, the rise of political\\n', 'parties, the growth of the West, the second war with England, and the\\n', 'apparent triumph of the national spirit over sectionalism.\\n', '\\n', 'The new republic had hardly been started in 1783 before its troubles\\n', 'began. The government could not raise money to pay its debts or running\\n', 'expenses; it could not protect American commerce and manufactures\\n', 'against European competition; it could not stop the continual issues of\\n', 'paper money by the states; it could not intervene to put down domestic\\n', 'uprisings that threatened the existence of the state governments.\\n', 'Without money, without an army, without courts of law, the union under\\n', 'the Articles of Confederation was drifting into dissolution. Patriots,\\n', 'who had risked their lives for independence, began to talk of monarchy\\n', 'again. Washington, Hamilton, and Madison insisted that a new\\n', 'constitution alone could save America from disaster.\\n', '\\n', 'By dint of much labor the friends of a new form of government induced\\n', 'the Congress to call a national convention to take into account the\\n', 'state of America. In May, 1787, it assembled at Philadelphia and for\\n', 'months it debated and wrangled over plans for a constitution. The small\\n', 'states clamored for equal rights in the union. The large states vowed\\n', 'compromise saved the convention from breaking up. In addition, there\\n', 'were jealousies between the planting states and the commercial states.\\n', 'Here, too, compromises had to be worked out. Some of the delegates\\n', 'feared the growth of democracy and others cherished it. These factions\\n', 'also had to be placated. At last a plan of government was drafted--the\\n', 'Constitution of the United States--and submitted to the states for\\n', 'approval. Only after a long and acrimonious debate did enough states\\n', 'ratify the instrument to put it into effect. On April 30, 1789, George\\n', 'Washington was inaugurated first President.\\n', '\\n', 'The new government proceeded to fund the old debt of the nation, assume\\n', 'the debts of the states, found a national bank, lay heavy taxes to pay\\n', 'the bills, and enact laws protecting American industry and commerce.\\n', 'Hamilton led the way, but he had not gone far before he encountered\\n', 'opposition. He found a formidable antagonist in Jefferson. In time two\\n', 'political parties appeared full armed upon the scene: the Federalists\\n', 'and the Republicans. For ten years they filled the country with\\n', 'political debate. In 1800 the Federalists were utterly vanquished by the\\n', 'Republicans with Jefferson in the lead.\\n', '\\n', 'By their proclamations of faith the Republicans favored the states\\n', 'rather than the new national government, but in practice they added\\n', 'immensely to the prestige and power of the nation. They purchased\\n', 'Louisiana from France, they waged a war for commercial independence\\n', 'against England, they created a second United States Bank, they enacted\\n', 'the protective tariff of 1816, they declared that Congress had power to\\n', 'abolish slavery north of the Missouri Compromise line, and they spread\\n', 'the shield of the Monroe Doctrine between the Western Hemisphere and\\n', 'Europe.\\n', '\\n', 'Still America was a part of European civilization. Currents of opinion\\n', 'flowed to and fro across the Atlantic. Friends of popular government in\\n', 'Europe looked to America as the great exemplar of their ideals. Events\\n', 'in Europe reacted upon thought in the United States. The French\\n', 'Revolution exerted a profound influence on the course of political\\n', 'debate. While it was in the stage of mere reform all Americans favored\\n', 'it. When the king was executed and a radical democracy set up, American\\n', 'opinion was divided. When France fell under the military dominion of\\n', 'Napoleon and preyed upon American commerce, the United States made ready\\n', 'for war.\\n', '\\n', 'The conduct of England likewise affected American affairs. In 1793 war\\n', 'broke out between England and France and raged with only a slight\\n', 'intermission until 1815. England and France both ravaged American\\n', 'commerce, but England was the more serious offender because she had\\n', 'command of the seas. Though Jefferson and Madison strove for peace, the\\n', 'country was swept into war by the vehemence of the \"Young Republicans,\"\\n', 'headed by Clay and Calhoun.\\n', '\\n', 'When the armed conflict was closed, one in diplomacy opened. The\\n', 'autocratic powers of Europe threatened to intervene on behalf of Spain\\n', 'in her attempt to recover possession of her Latin-American colonies.\\n', 'Their challenge to America brought forth the Monroe Doctrine. The powers\\n', 'of Europe were warned not to interfere with the independence or the\\n', 'republican policies of this hemisphere or to attempt any new\\n', 'colonization in it.

The democracy of Jefferson\\n', 'was, in the beginning, provincial. The historic mission of uniting\\n', 'nationalism and democracy was in the course of time given to new leaders\\n', 'from a region beyond the mountains, peopled by men and women from all\\n', 'sections and free from those state traditions which ran back to the\\n', 'early days of colonization. The voice of the democratic nationalism\\n', 'nourished in the West was heard when Clay of Kentucky advocated his\\n', 'American system of protection for industries; when Jackson of Tennessee\\n', 'condemned nullification in a ringing proclamation that has taken its\\n', 'place among the great American state papers; and when Lincoln of\\n', 'Illinois, in a fateful hour, called upon a bewildered people to meet the\\n', 'supreme test whether this was a nation destined to survive or to perish.\\n', \"And it will be remembered that Lincoln's party chose for its banner that\\n\", 'earlier device--Republican--which Jefferson had made a sign of power.\\n', 'The \"rail splitter\" from Illinois united the nationalism of Hamilton\\n', 'with the democracy of Jefferson, and his appeal was clothed in the\\n', 'simple language of the people, not in the sonorous rhetoric which\\n', 'Webster learned in the schools.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The West and the American Revolution.=--The excessive attention devoted\\n', 'by historians to the military operations along the coast has obscured\\n', 'the role played by the frontier in the American Revolution. The action\\n', 'of Great Britain in closing western land to easy settlement in 1763 was\\n', 'more than an incident in precipitating the war for independence.\\n', 'Americans on the frontier did not forget it; when Indians were employed\\n', 'by England to defend that land, zeal for the patriot cause set the\\n', 'interior aflame. It was the members of the western vanguard, like Daniel\\n', 'Boone, John Sevier, and George Rogers Clark, who first understood the\\n', 'value of the far-away country under the guns of the English forts, where\\n', 'the Red Men still wielded the tomahawk and the scalping knife. It was\\n', 'they who gave the East no rest until their vision was seen by the\\n', 'leaders on the seaboard who directed the course of national policy. It\\n', 'was one of their number, a seasoned Indian fighter, George Rogers Clark,\\n', 'who with aid from Virginia seized Kaskaskia and Vincennes and secured\\n', \"the whole Northwest to the union while the fate of Washington's army was\\n\", 'still hanging in the balance.\\n', '\\n', '=Western Problems at the End of the Revolution.=--The treaty of peace,\\n', 'signed with Great Britain in 1783, brought the definite cession of the\\n', 'coveted territory west to the Mississippi River, but it left unsolved\\n', 'many problems. In the first place, tribes of resentful Indians in the\\n', 'Ohio region, even though British support was withdrawn at last, had to\\n', 'be reckoned with; and it was not until after the establishment of the\\n', 'federal Constitution that a well-equipped army could be provided to\\n', 'guarantee peace on the border. In the second place, British garrisons\\n', 'still occupied forts on Lake Erie pending the execution of the terms of\\n', 'the treaty of 1783--terms which were not fulfilled until after the\\n', 'ratification of the Jay treaty twelve years later. In the third place,\\n', 'Virginia, Connecticut, and Massachusetts had conflicting claims to the\\n', 'land in the Northwest based on old English charters and Indian treaties.\\n', 'It was only after a bitter contest that the states reached an agreement\\n', 'to transfer their rights to the government of the United States,\\n', 'Virginia executing her deed of cession on March 1, 1784. In the fourth\\n', 'place, titles to lands bought by individuals remained uncertain in the\\n', 'absence of official maps and records. To meet this last situation,\\n', 'Congress instituted a systematic survey of the Ohio country, laying it\\n', 'out into townships, sections of 640 acres each, and quarter sections. In\\n', 'every township one section of land was set aside for the support of\\n', 'public schools.\\n', '\\n', '=The Northwest Ordinance.=--The final problem which had to be solved\\n', 'before settlement on a large scale could be begun was that of governing\\n', 'the territory. Pioneers who looked with hungry eyes on the fertile\\n', 'valley of the Ohio could hardly restrain their impatience. Soldiers of\\n', 'the Revolution, who had been paid for their services in land warrants\\n', 'entitling them to make entries in the West, called for action.\\n', '\\n', 'Congress answered by passing in 1787 the famous Northwest Ordinance\\n', 'providing for temporary territorial government to be followed by the\\n', 'creation of a popular assembly as soon as there were five thousand free\\n', 'males in any district. Eventual admission to the union on an equal\\n', 'footing with the original states was promised to the new territories.\\n', 'Religious freedom was guaranteed. The safeguards of trial by jury,\\n', 'regular judicial procedure, and _habeas corpus_ were established, in order\\n', 'that the methods of civilized life might take the place of the\\n', 'rough-and-ready justice of lynch law. During the course of the debate on\\n', 'the Ordinance, Congress added the sixth article forbidding slavery and\\n', 'involuntary servitude.\\n', '\\n', 'This Charter of the Northwest, so well planned by the Congress under the\\n', 'Articles of Confederation, was continued in force by the first Congress\\n', 'under the Constitution in 1789. The following year its essential\\n', 'provisions, except the ban on slavery, were applied to the territory\\n', 'south of the Ohio, ceded by North Carolina to the national government,\\n', 'and in 1798 to the Mississippi territory, once held by Georgia. Thus it\\n', 'was settled for all time that \"the new colonies were not to be exploited\\n', 'for the benefit of the parent states (any more than for the benefit of\\n', 'England) but were to be autonomous and coordinate commonwealths.\" This\\n', 'outcome, bitterly opposed by some Eastern leaders who feared the triumph\\n', 'of Western states over the seaboard, completed the legal steps necessary\\n', 'by way of preparation for the flood of settlers.\\n', '\\n', '=The Land Companies, Speculators, and Western Land Tenure.=--As in the\\n', 'original settlement of America, so in the opening of the West, great\\n', 'companies and single proprietors of large grants early figured. In 1787\\n', 'the Ohio Land Company, a New England concern, acquired a million and a\\n', 'half acres on the Ohio and began operations by planting the town of\\n', 'acres lower down where the city of Cincinnati was founded. Other\\n', \"individuals bought up soldiers' claims and so acquired enormous holdings\\n\", 'for speculative purposes. Indeed, there was such a rush to make fortunes\\n', 'quickly through the rise in land values that Washington was moved to cry\\n', 'out against the \"rage for speculating in and forestalling of land on the\\n', 'North West of the Ohio,\" protesting that \"scarce a valuable spot within\\n', 'any tolerable distance of it is left without a claimant.\" He therefore\\n', 'urged Congress to fix a reasonable price for the land, not \"too\\n', 'exorbitant and burdensome for real occupiers, but high enough to\\n', 'discourage monopolizers.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Congress, however, was not prepared to use the public domain for the\\n', 'sole purpose of developing a body of small freeholders in the West. It\\n', 'still looked upon the sale of public lands as an important source of\\n', 'revenue with which to pay off the public debt; consequently it thought\\n', 'more of instant income than of ultimate results. It placed no limit on\\n', 'the amount which could be bought when it fixed the price at $2 an acre\\n', 'in 1796, and it encouraged the professional land operator by making the\\n', 'first installment only twenty cents an acre in addition to the small\\n', 'registration and survey fee. On such terms a speculator with a few\\n', 'thousand dollars could get possession of an enormous plot of land. If he\\n', 'was fortunate in disposing of it, he could meet the installments, which\\n', 'were spread over a period of four years, and make a handsome profit for\\n', 'himself. Even when the credit or installment feature was abolished in\\n', 'the opportunity for large speculative purchases continued to attract\\n', 'capital to land ventures.\\n', '\\n', '=The Development of the Small Freehold.=--The cheapness of land and the\\n', 'scarcity of labor, nevertheless, made impossible the triumph of the huge\\n', 'estate with its semi-servile tenantry. For about $45 a man could get a\\n', 'farm of 160 acres on the installment plan; another payment of $80 was\\n', 'due in forty days; but a four-year term was allowed for the discharge of\\n', 'the balance. With a capital of from two to three hundred dollars a\\n', 'family could embark on a land venture. If it had good crops, it could\\n', 'meet the deferred payments. It was, however, a hard battle at best. Many\\n', 'a man forfeited his land through failure to pay the final installment;\\n', 'yet in the end, in spite of all the handicaps, the small freehold of a\\n', 'few hundred acres at most became the typical unit of Western\\n', 'agriculture, except in the planting states of the Gulf. Even the lands\\n', 'of the great companies were generally broken up and sold in small lots.\\n', '\\n', 'The tendency toward moderate holdings, so favored by Western conditions,\\n', 'was also promoted by a clause in the Northwest Ordinance declaring that\\n', 'the land of any person dying intestate--that is, without any will\\n', 'disposing of it--should be divided equally among his descendants.\\n', 'Hildreth says of this provision: \"It established the important\\n', 'republican principle, not then introduced into all the states, of the\\n', 'equal distribution of landed as well as personal property.\" All these\\n', 'forces combined made the wide dispersion of wealth, in the early days of\\n', 'the nineteenth century, an American characteristic, in marked contrast\\n', 'with the European system of family prestige and vast estates based on\\n', 'the law of primogeniture.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The People.=--With government established, federal arms victorious over\\n', 'the Indians, and the lands surveyed for sale, the way was prepared for\\n', 'the immigrants. They came with a rush. Young New Englanders, weary of\\n', 'tilling the stony soil of their native states, poured through New York\\n', 'and Pennsylvania, some settling on the northern bank of the Ohio but\\n', 'most of them in the Lake region. Sons and daughters of German farmers in\\n', 'Pennsylvania and many a redemptioner who had discharged his bond of\\n', 'servitude pressed out into Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, or beyond. From\\n', 'the exhausted fields and the clay hills of the Southern states came\\n', 'pioneers of English and Scotch-Irish descent, the latter in great\\n', 'numbers. Indeed one historian of high authority has ventured to say that\\n', '\"the rapid expansion of the United States from a coast strip to a\\n', 'continental area is largely a Scotch-Irish achievement.\" While native\\n', 'Americans of mixed stocks led the way into the West, it was not long\\n', 'before immigrants direct from Europe, under the stimulus of company\\n', 'enterprise, began to filter into the new settlements in increasing\\n', 'numbers.\\n', '\\n', 'The types of people were as various as the nations they represented.\\n', 'Timothy Flint, who published his entertaining _Recollections_ in 1826,\\n', 'found the West a strange mixture of all sorts and conditions of people.\\n', 'Some of them, he relates, had been hunters in the upper world of the\\n', 'Mississippi, above the falls of St. Anthony. Some had been still farther\\n', 'north, in Canada. Still others had wandered from the South--the Gulf of\\n', 'Mexico, the Red River, and the Spanish country. French boatmen and\\n', 'trappers, Spanish traders from the Southwest, Virginia planters with\\n', 'their droves of slaves mingled with English, German, and Scotch-Irish\\n', 'farmers. Hunters, forest rangers, restless bordermen, and squatters,\\n', 'like the foaming combers of an advancing tide, went first. Then followed\\n', 'the farmers, masters of the ax and plow, with their wives who shared\\n', 'every burden and hardship and introduced some of the features of\\n', 'civilized life. The hunters and rangers passed on to new scenes; the\\n', 'home makers built for all time.\\n', '\\n', '=The Number of Immigrants.=--There were no official stations on the\\n', 'frontier to record the number of immigrants who entered the West during\\n', 'the decades following the American Revolution. But travelers of the time\\n', 'record that every road was \"crowded\" with pioneers and their families,\\n', 'their wagons and cattle; and that they were seldom out of the sound of\\n', 'the snapping whip of the teamster urging forward his horses or the crack\\n', 'of the hunter\\'s rifle as he brought down his evening meal. \"During the\\n', 'latter half of 1787,\" says Coman, \"more than nine hundred boats floated\\n', 'down the Ohio carrying eighteen thousand men, women, and children, and\\n', 'twelve thousand horses, sheep, and cattle, and six hundred and fifty\\n', 'wagons.\" Other lines of travel were also crowded and with the passing\\n', 'years the flooding tide of home seekers rose higher and higher.\\n', '\\n', '=The Western Routes.=--Four main routes led into the country beyond the\\n', 'Appalachians. The Genesee road, beginning at Albany, ran almost due west\\n', 'to the present site of Buffalo on Lake Erie, through a level country. In\\n', 'the dry season, wagons laden with goods could easily pass along it into\\n', 'eastern branches, one starting at Philadelphia, one at Baltimore, and\\n', 'from Alexandria to Boonesboro in Kentucky and then westward across the\\n', 'the Cumberland Gap and by branches extended into the Cumberland valley\\n', 'and the Kentucky country.\\n', '\\n', 'Of these four lines of travel, the Pittsburgh route offered the most\\n', 'advantages. Pioneers, no matter from what section they came, when once\\n', 'they were on the headwaters of the Ohio and in possession of a flatboat,\\n', 'could find a quick and easy passage into all parts of the West and\\n', 'Southwest. Whether they wanted to settle in Ohio, Kentucky, or western\\n', 'Tennessee they could find their way down the drifting flood to their\\n', 'destination or at least to some spot near it. Many people from the South\\n', 'as well as the Northern and Middle states chose this route; so it came\\n', 'about that the sons and daughters of Virginia and the Carolinas mingled\\n', 'with those of New York, Pennsylvania, and New England in the settlement\\n', 'of the Northwest territory.\\n', '\\n', '=The Methods of Travel into the West.=--Many stories giving exact\\n', 'descriptions of methods of travel into the West in the early days have\\n', 'been preserved. The country was hardly opened before visitors from the\\n', 'Old World and from the Eastern states, impelled by curiosity, made their\\n', 'way to the very frontier of civilization and wrote books to inform or\\n', 'amuse the public. One of them, Gilbert Imlay, an English traveler, has\\n', 'given us an account of the Pittsburgh route as he found it in 1791. \"If\\n', 'a man ... \" he writes, \"has a family or goods of any sort to remove, his\\n', 'best way, then, would be to purchase a waggon and team of horses to\\n', 'carry his property to Redstone Old Fort or to Pittsburgh, according as\\n', 'cost, at Philadelphia, about $10 ... and the horses about $12 each; they\\n', 'would cost something more both at Baltimore and Alexandria. The waggon\\n', 'may be covered with canvass, and if it is the choice of the people, they\\n', 'may sleep in it of nights with the greatest safety. But if they dislike\\n', 'that, there are inns of accommodation the whole distance on the\\n', '[that is, from the farmers along the road]; and by having two or three\\n', 'camp kettles and stopping every evening when the weather is fine upon\\n', 'the brink of some rivulet and by kindling a fire they may soon dress\\n', 'their own food.... This manner of journeying is so far from being\\n', 'disagreeable that in a fine season it is extremely pleasant.\" The\\n', 'immigrant once at Pittsburgh or Wheeling could then buy a flatboat of a\\n', 'size required for his goods and stock, and drift down the current to his\\n', \"journey's end.\\n\", '\\n', '\\n', '=The Admission of Kentucky and Tennessee.=--When the eighteenth century\\n', 'drew to a close, Kentucky had a population larger than Delaware, Rhode\\n', 'Island, or New Hampshire. Tennessee claimed 60,000 inhabitants. In 1792\\n', 'Kentucky took her place as a state beside her none too kindly parent,\\n', 'Virginia. The Eastern Federalists resented her intrusion; but they took\\n', 'some consolation in the admission of Vermont because the balance of\\n', 'Eastern power was still retained.\\n', '\\n', 'As if to assert their independence of old homes and conservative ideas\\n', \"the makers of Kentucky's first constitution swept aside the landed\\n\", 'qualification on the suffrage and gave the vote to all free white males.\\n', \"Four years later, Kentucky's neighbor to the south, Tennessee, followed\\n\", 'this step toward a wider democracy. After encountering fierce opposition\\n', 'from the Federalists, Tennessee was accepted as the sixteenth state.\\n', '\\n', '=Ohio.=--The door of the union had hardly opened for Tennessee when\\n', 'another appeal was made to Congress, this time from the pioneers in\\n', 'Ohio. The little posts founded at Marietta and Cincinnati had grown into\\n', 'flourishing centers of trade. The stream of immigrants, flowing down the\\n', 'river, added daily to their numbers and the growing settlements all\\n', 'around poured produce into their markets to be exchanged for \"store\\n', 'goods.\" After the Indians were disposed of in 1794 and the last British\\n', 'soldier left the frontier forts under the terms of the Jay treaty of\\n', '1795, tiny settlements of families appeared on Lake Erie in the \"Western\\n', 'Reserve,\" a region that had been retained by Connecticut when she\\n', 'surrendered her other rights in the Northwest.\\n', '\\n', 'At the close of the century, Ohio, claiming a population of more than\\n', '50,000, grew discontented with its territorial status. Indeed, two years\\n', 'before the enactment of the Northwest Ordinance, squatters in that\\n', 'region had been invited by one John Emerson to hold a convention after\\n', 'the fashion of the men of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield in old\\n', 'Connecticut and draft a frame of government for themselves. This true\\n', 'son of New England declared that men \"have an undoubted right to pass\\n', 'into every vacant country and there to form their constitution and that\\n', 'from the confederation of the whole United States Congress is not\\n', 'empowered to forbid them.\" This grand convention was never held because\\n', 'the heavy hand of the government fell upon the leaders; but the spirit\\n', 'of John Emerson did not perish. In November, 1802, a convention chosen\\n', 'by voters, assembled under the authority of Congress at Chillicothe,\\n', 'drew up a constitution. It went into force after a popular ratification.\\n', 'The roll of the convention bore such names as Abbot, Baldwin, Cutler,\\n', 'Huntington, Putnam, and Sargent, and the list of counties from which\\n', 'they came included Adams, Fairfield, Hamilton, Jefferson, Trumbull, and\\n', 'Washington, showing that the new America in the West was peopled and led\\n', 'by the old stock. In 1803 Ohio was admitted to the union.\\n', '\\n', '=Indiana and Illinois.=--As in the neighboring state, the frontier in\\n', 'Indiana advanced northward from the Ohio, mainly under the leadership,\\n', 'however, of settlers from the South--restless Kentuckians hoping for\\n', 'better luck in a newer country and pioneers from the far frontiers of\\n', 'Virginia and North Carolina. As soon as a tier of counties swinging\\n', 'upward like the horns of the moon against Ohio on the east and in the\\n', 'Wabash Valley on the west was fairly settled, a clamor went up for\\n', 'statehood. Under the authority of an act of Congress in 1816 the\\n', 'Indianians drafted a constitution and inaugurated their government at\\n', 'Corydon. \"The majority of the members of the convention,\" we are told by\\n', 'a local historian, \"were frontier farmers who had a general idea of what\\n', 'they wanted and had sense enough to let their more erudite colleagues\\n', 'put it into shape.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Two years later, the pioneers of Illinois, also settled upward from the\\n', 'Ohio, like Indiana, elected their delegates to draft a constitution.\\n', 'Leadership in the convention, quite properly, was taken by a man born in\\n', 'New York and reared in Tennessee; and the constitution as finally\\n', 'drafted \"was in its principal provisions a copy of the then existing\\n', 'constitutions of Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana.... Many of the articles\\n', 'are exact copies in wording although differently arranged and\\n', 'numbered.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.=--Across the Mississippi to the\\n', 'far south, clearing and planting had gone on with much bustle and\\n', 'enterprise. The cotton and sugar lands of Louisiana, opened by French\\n', 'and Spanish settlers, were widened in every direction by planters with\\n', 'their armies of slaves from the older states. New Orleans, a good market\\n', 'and a center of culture not despised even by the pioneer, grew apace. In\\n', '1810 the population of lower Louisiana was over 75,000. The time had\\n', 'come, said the leaders of the people, to fulfill the promise made to\\n', 'France in the treaty of cession; namely, to grant to the inhabitants of\\n', 'the territory statehood and the rights of American citizens. Federalists\\n', 'from New England still having a voice in Congress, if somewhat weaker,\\n', 'deliberate opinion,\" pronounced Josiah Quincy in the House of\\n', 'Representatives, \"that if this bill [to admit Louisiana] passes, the\\n', 'bonds of this Union are virtually dissolved ... that as it will be the\\n', 'right of all, so it will be the duty of some [states] to prepare\\n', 'definitely for a separation; amicably if they can, violently if they\\n', 'must.... It is a death blow to the Constitution. It may afterwards\\n', 'linger; but lingering, its fate will, at no very distant period, be\\n', 'consummated.\" Federalists from New York like those from New England had\\n', 'their doubts about the wisdom of admitting Western states; but the party\\n', 'of Jefferson and Madison, having the necessary majority, granted the\\n', 'coveted statehood to Louisiana in 1812.\\n', '\\n', 'When, a few years later, Mississippi and Alabama knocked at the doors of\\n', 'the union, the Federalists had so little influence, on account of their\\n', 'conduct during the second war with England, that spokesmen from the\\n', 'Southwest met a kindlier reception at Washington. Mississippi, in 1817,\\n', 'and Alabama, in 1819, took their places among the United States of\\n', 'America. Both of them, while granting white manhood suffrage, gave their\\n', 'constitutions the tone of the old East by providing landed\\n', 'qualifications for the governor and members of the legislature.\\n', '\\n', '=Missouri.=--Far to the north in the Louisiana purchase, a new\\n', 'commonwealth was rising to power. It was peopled by immigrants who came\\n', 'down the Ohio in fleets of boats or crossed the Mississippi from\\n', 'Kentucky and Tennessee. Thrifty Germans from Pennsylvania, hardy farmers\\n', 'from Virginia ready to work with their own hands, freemen seeking\\n', \"freemen's homes, planters with their slaves moving on from worn-out\\n\", 'fields on the seaboard, came together in the widening settlements of the\\n', 'Missouri country. Peoples from the North and South flowed together,\\n', 'small farmers and big planters mingling in one community. When their\\n', 'numbers had reached sixty thousand or more, they precipitated a contest\\n', 'over their admission to the union, \"ringing an alarm bell in the night,\"\\n', 'as Jefferson phrased it. The favorite expedient of compromise with\\n', 'slavery was brought forth in Congress once more. Maine consequently was\\n', 'brought into the union without slavery and Missouri with slavery. At the\\n', 'same time there was drawn westward through the rest of the Louisiana\\n', 'territory a line separating servitude from slavery.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Land Tenure and Liberty.=--Over an immense western area there developed\\n', 'an unbroken system of freehold farms. In the Gulf states and the lower\\n', 'Mississippi Valley, it is true, the planter with his many slaves even\\n', 'led in the pioneer movement; but through large sections of Tennessee and\\n', 'Kentucky, as well as upper Georgia and Alabama, and all throughout the\\n', 'Northwest territory the small farmer reigned supreme. In this immense\\n', 'dominion there sprang up a civilization without caste or class--a body\\n', \"of people all having about the same amount of this world's goods and\\n\", 'deriving their livelihood from one source: the labor of their own hands\\n', 'on the soil. The Northwest territory alone almost equaled in area all\\n', 'the original thirteen states combined, except Georgia, and its system of\\n', 'agricultural economy was unbroken by plantations and feudal estates. \"In\\n', 'the subdivision of the soil and the great equality of condition,\" as\\n', 'Webster said on more than one occasion, \"lay the true basis, most\\n', 'certainly, of popular government.\" There was the undoubted source of\\n', 'Jacksonian democracy.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Characteristics of the Western People.=--Travelers into the\\n', 'Northwest during the early years of the nineteenth century were agreed\\n', 'that the people of that region were almost uniformly marked by the\\n', 'willingness to go through any hardship to accomplish an object....\\n', 'Independence of thought and action. They have felt the influence of\\n', 'these principles from their childhood. Men who can endure anything; that\\n', 'have lived almost without restraint, free as the mountain air or as the\\n', 'deer and the buffalo of their forests, and who know they are Americans\\n', 'all.... An apparent roughness which some would deem rudeness of\\n', 'manner.... Where there is perfect equality in a neighborhood of people\\n', \"who know little about each other's previous history or ancestry but\\n\", 'where each is lord of the soil he cultivates. Where a log cabin is all\\n', 'that the best of families can expect to have for years and of course can\\n', 'possess few of the external decorations which have so much influence in\\n', 'creating a diversity of rank in society. These circumstances have laid\\n', 'the foundation for that equality of intercourse, simplicity of manners,\\n', 'want of deference, want of reserve, great readiness to make\\n', 'acquaintances, freedom of speech, indisposition to brook real or\\n', 'imaginary insults which one witnesses among people of the West.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This equality, this independence, this rudeness so often described by\\n', 'the traveler as marking a new country, were all accentuated by the\\n', 'character of the settlers themselves. Traces of the fierce, unsociable,\\n', 'eagle-eyed, hard-drinking hunter remained. The settlers who followed the\\n', 'hunter were, with some exceptions, soldiers of the Revolutionary army,\\n', 'farmers of the \"middling order,\" and mechanics from the towns,--English,\\n', 'Scotch-Irish, Germans,--poor in possessions and thrown upon the labor of\\n', 'their own hands for support. Sons and daughters from well-to-do Eastern\\n', 'homes sometimes brought softer manners; but the equality of life and the\\n', 'leveling force of labor in forest and field soon made them one in spirit\\n', 'with their struggling neighbors. Even the preachers and teachers, who\\n', 'came when the cabins were raised in the clearings and rude churches and\\n', 'schoolhouses were built, preached sermons and taught lessons that\\n', 'savored of the frontier, as any one may know who reads Peter\\n', \"Cartwright's _A Muscular Christian_ or Eggleston's _The Hoosier\\n\", 'Schoolmaster_.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'attached to local self-government gave the conservative East many a rude\\n', 'shock, setting gentlemen in powdered wigs and knee breeches agog with\\n', 'the idea that terrible things might happen in the Mississippi Valley.\\n', 'Not without good grounds did Washington fear that \"a touch of a feather\\n', 'would turn\" the Western settlers away from the seaboard to the\\n', 'Spaniards; and seriously did he urge the East not to neglect them, lest\\n', 'they be \"drawn into the arms of, or be dependent upon foreigners.\"\\n', 'Taking advantage of the restless spirit in the Southwest, Aaron Burr,\\n', 'having disgraced himself by killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel, laid\\n', 'wild plans, if not to bring about a secession in that region, at least\\n', 'to build a state of some kind out of the Spanish dominions adjoining\\n', 'Louisiana. Frightened at such enterprises and fearing the dominance of\\n', 'the West, the Federalists, with a few conspicuous exceptions, opposed\\n', 'equality between the sections. Had their narrow views prevailed, the\\n', 'West, with its new democracy, would have been held in perpetual tutelage\\n', 'to the seaboard or perhaps been driven into independence as the thirteen\\n', 'colonies had been not long before.\\n', '\\n', '=Eastern Friends of the West.=--Fortunately for the nation, there were\\n', 'many Eastern leaders, particularly from the South, who understood the\\n', 'West, approved its spirit, and sought to bring the two sections together\\n', 'by common bonds. Washington kept alive and keen the zeal for Western\\n', 'advancement which he acquired in his youth as a surveyor. He never grew\\n', 'tired of urging upon his Eastern friends the importance of the lands\\n', 'beyond the mountains. He pressed upon the governor of Virginia a project\\n', 'for a wagon road connecting the seaboard with the Ohio country and was\\n', 'active in a movement to improve the navigation of the Potomac. He\\n', 'advocated strengthening the ties of commerce. \"Smooth the roads,\" he\\n', 'said, \"and make easy the way for them, and then see what an influx of\\n', 'articles will be poured upon us; how amazingly our exports will be\\n', 'increased by them; and how amply we shall be compensated for any trouble\\n', 'and expense we may encounter to effect it.\" Jefferson, too, was\\n', 'interested in every phase of Western development--the survey of lands,\\n', 'the exploration of waterways, the opening of trade, and even the\\n', 'discovery of the bones of prehistoric animals. Robert Fulton, the\\n', 'inventor of the steamboat, was another man of vision who for many years\\n', 'pressed upon his countrymen the necessity of uniting East and West by a\\n', 'canal which would cement the union, raise the value of the public lands,\\n', 'and extend the principles of confederate and republican government.\\n', '\\n', '=The Difficulties of Early Transportation.=--Means of communication\\n', 'played an important part in the strategy of all those who sought to\\n', 'bring together the seaboard and the frontier. The produce of the\\n', 'West--wheat, corn, bacon, hemp, cattle, and tobacco--was bulky and the\\n', 'cost of overland transportation was prohibitive. In the Eastern market,\\n', '\"a cow and her calf were given for a bushel of salt, while a suit of\\n', '\\'store clothes\\' cost as much as a farm.\" In such circumstances, the\\n', 'inhabitants of the Mississippi Valley were forced to ship their produce\\n', 'over a long route by way of New Orleans and to pay high freight rates\\n', 'for everything that was brought across the mountains. Scows of from five\\n', 'to fifty tons were built at the towns along the rivers and piloted down\\n', 'the stream to the Crescent City. In a few cases small ocean-going\\n', 'vessels were built to transport goods to the West Indies or to the\\n', 'Eastern coast towns. Salt, iron, guns, powder, and the absolute\\n', 'essentials which the pioneers had to buy mainly in Eastern markets were\\n', 'carried over narrow wagon trails that were almost impassable in the\\n', 'rainy season.\\n', '\\n', '=The National Road.=--To far-sighted men, like Albert Gallatin, \"the\\n', 'father of internal improvements,\" the solution of this problem was the\\n', \"construction of roads and canals. Early in Jefferson's administration,\\n\", 'Congress dedicated a part of the proceeds from the sale of lands to\\n', 'building highways from the headwaters of the navigable waters emptying\\n', 'into the Atlantic to the Ohio River and beyond into the Northwest\\n', 'territory. In 1806, after many misgivings, it authorized a great\\n', 'national highway binding the East and the West. The Cumberland Road, as\\n', 'it was called, began in northwestern Maryland, wound through southern\\n', 'Pennsylvania, crossed the narrow neck of Virginia at Wheeling, and then\\n', 'shot almost straight across Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, into Missouri.\\n', 'By 1817, stagecoaches were running between Washington and Wheeling; by\\n', '1833 contractors had carried their work to Columbus, Ohio, and by 1852,\\n', 'to Vandalia, Illinois. Over this ballasted road mail and passenger\\n', 'coaches could go at high speed, and heavy freight wagons proceed in\\n', 'safety at a steady pace.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'East and West was reached with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825,\\n', 'offering an all-water route from New York City to the Great Lakes and\\n', 'the Mississippi Valley. Pennsylvania, alarmed by the advantages\\n', 'conferred on New York by this enterprise, began her system of canals and\\n', 'portages from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, completing the last link in\\n', '1834. In the South, the Chesapeake and Ohio Company, chartered in 1825,\\n', 'was busy with a project to connect Georgetown and Cumberland when\\n', 'railways broke in upon the undertaking before it was half finished.\\n', 'About the same time, Ohio built a canal across the state, affording\\n', 'water communication between Lake Erie and the Ohio River through a rich\\n', 'wheat belt. Passengers could now travel by canal boat into the West with\\n', 'comparative ease and comfort, if not at a rapid speed, and the bulkiest\\n', 'of freight could be easily handled. Moreover, the rate charged for\\n', 'carrying goods was cut by the Erie Canal from $32 a ton per hundred\\n', 'miles to $1. New Orleans was destined to lose her primacy in the\\n', 'Mississippi Valley.\\n', '\\n', 'The diversion of traffic to Eastern markets was also stimulated by\\n', 'steamboats which appeared on the Ohio about 1810, three years after\\n', 'Fulton had made his famous trip on the Hudson. It took twenty men to\\n', 'sail and row a five-ton scow up the river at a speed of from ten to\\n', 'twenty miles a day. In 1825, Timothy Flint traveled a hundred miles a\\n', 'day on the new steamer _Grecian_ \"against the whole weight of the\\n', 'Mississippi current.\" Three years later the round trip from Louisville\\n', 'to New Orleans was cut to eight days. Heavy produce that once had to\\n', 'float down to New Orleans could be carried upstream and sent to the East\\n', 'by way of the canal systems.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Thus the far country was brought near.

The Southern states will first avail themselves of their\\n', 'new confederates to govern the East, and finally the Western states,\\n', 'multiplied in number, and augmented in population, will control the\\n', 'interests of the whole.\" Strangely enough the fulfillment of this\\n', 'prophecy was being prepared even in Federalist strongholds by the rise\\n', 'of a new urban democracy that was to make common cause with the farmers\\n', 'beyond the mountains.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Aristocratic Features of the Old Order.=--The Revolutionary\\n', 'fathers, in setting up their first state constitutions, although they\\n', 'often spoke of government as founded on the consent of the governed, did\\n', 'not think that consistency required giving the vote to all adult males.\\n', 'On the contrary they looked upon property owners as the only safe\\n', '\"depositary\" of political power. They went back to the colonial\\n', 'tradition that related taxation and representation. This, they argued,\\n', 'was not only just but a safeguard against the \"excesses of democracy.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In carrying their theory into execution they placed taxpaying or\\n', 'property qualifications on the right to vote. Broadly speaking, these\\n', 'limitations fell into three classes. Three states, Pennsylvania (1776),\\n', 'New Hampshire (1784), and Georgia (1798), gave the ballot to all who\\n', 'paid taxes, without reference to the value of their property. Three,\\n', 'Virginia, Delaware, and Rhode Island, clung firmly to the ancient\\n', 'principles that only freeholders could be intrusted with electoral\\n', 'rights. Still other states, while closely restricting the suffrage,\\n', 'accepted the ownership of other things as well as land in fulfillment of\\n', 'the requirements. In Massachusetts, for instance, the vote was granted\\n', 'to all men who held land yielding an annual income of three pounds or\\n', 'possessed other property worth sixty pounds.\\n', '\\n', 'The electors thus enfranchised, numerous as they were, owing to the wide\\n', 'distribution of land, often suffered from a very onerous disability. In\\n', 'many states they were able to vote only for persons of wealth because\\n', 'heavy property qualifications were imposed on public officers. In New\\n', 'Hampshire, the governor had to be worth five hundred pounds, one-half in\\n', 'land; in Massachusetts, one thousand pounds, all freehold; in Maryland,\\n', 'five thousand pounds, one thousand of which was freehold; in North\\n', 'Carolina, one thousand pounds freehold; and in South Carolina, ten\\n', 'owner of a freehold worth three hundred pounds or personal property\\n', \"worth six hundred pounds; in New Jersey, one thousand pounds' worth of\\n\", 'property; in North Carolina, three hundred acres of land; in South\\n', 'Carolina, two thousand pounds freehold. For members of the lower house\\n', 'of the legislature lower qualifications were required.\\n', '\\n', 'In most of the states the suffrage or office holding or both were\\n', 'further restricted by religious provisions. No single sect was powerful\\n', 'enough to dominate after the Revolution, but, for the most part,\\n', 'Catholics and Jews were either disfranchised or excluded from office.\\n', 'North Carolina and Georgia denied the ballot to any one who was not a\\n', 'Protestant. Delaware withheld it from all who did not believe in the\\n', 'Trinity and the inspiration of the Scriptures. Massachusetts and\\n', 'Maryland limited it to Christians. Virginia and New York, advanced for\\n', 'their day, made no discrimination in government on account of religious\\n', 'opinion.\\n', '\\n', '=The Defense of the Old Order.=--It must not be supposed that property\\n', 'qualifications were thoughtlessly imposed at the outset or considered of\\n', 'little consequence in practice. In the beginning they were viewed as\\n', 'fundamental. As towns grew in size and the number of landless citizens\\n', 'increased, the restrictions were defended with even more vigor. In\\n', 'Massachusetts, the great Webster upheld the rights of property in\\n', 'government, saying: \"It is entirely just that property should have its\\n', 'due weight and consideration in political arrangements.... The\\n', 'disastrous revolutions which the world has witnessed, those political\\n', 'thunderstorms and earthquakes which have shaken the pillars of society\\n', 'to their deepest foundations, have been revolutions against property.\"\\n', 'In Pennsylvania, a leader in local affairs cried out against a plan to\\n', 'remove the taxpaying limitation on the suffrage: \"What does the delegate\\n', 'propose? To place the vicious vagrant, the wandering Arabs, the Tartar\\n', 'hordes of our large cities on the level with the virtuous and good man?\"\\n', 'In Virginia, Jefferson himself had first believed in property\\n', 'qualifications and had feared with genuine alarm the \"mobs of the great\\n', 'cities.\" It was near the end of the eighteenth century before he\\n', 'accepted the idea of manhood suffrage. Even then he was unable to\\n', 'convince the constitution-makers of his own state. \"It is not an idle\\n', 'chimera of the brain,\" urged one of them, \"that the possession of land\\n', 'furnishes the strongest evidence of permanent, common interest with, and\\n', 'place the right of suffrage. This is the best general standard which can\\n', 'be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the persons to be\\n', 'invested with the right of suffrage are such persons as could be,\\n', 'consistently with the safety and well-being of the community, intrusted\\n', 'with the exercise of that right.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Attacks on the Restricted Suffrage.=--The changing circumstances of\\n', 'American life, however, soon challenged the rule of those with property.\\n', 'Prominent among the new forces were the rising mercantile and business\\n', 'interests. Where the freehold qualification was applied, business men\\n', 'who did not own land were deprived of the vote and excluded from office.\\n', 'In New York, for example, the most illiterate farmer who had one hundred\\n', \"pounds' worth of land could vote for state senator and governor, while\\n\", 'the landless banker or merchant could not. It is not surprising,\\n', 'therefore, to find business men taking the lead in breaking down\\n', 'freehold limitations on the suffrage. The professional classes also were\\n', 'interested in removing the barriers which excluded many of them from\\n', 'public affairs. It was a schoolmaster, Thomas Dorr, who led the popular\\n', 'uprising in Rhode Island which brought the exclusive rule by freeholders\\n', 'to an end.\\n', '\\n', 'In addition to the business and professional classes, the mechanics of\\n', 'the towns showed a growing hostility to a system of government that\\n', 'generally barred them from voting or holding office. Though not\\n', 'numerous, they had early begun to exercise an influence on the course of\\n', 'public affairs. They had led the riots against the Stamp Act, overturned\\n', 'King George\\'s statue, and \"crammed stamps down the throats of\\n', 'collectors.\" When the state constitutions were framed they took a lively\\n', 'interest, particularly in New York City and Philadelphia. In June, 1776,\\n', 'the \"mechanicks in union\" in New York protested against putting the new\\n', 'state constitution into effect without their approval, declaring that\\n', 'the right to vote on the acceptance or rejection of a fundamental law\\n', '\"is the birthright of every man to whatever state he may belong.\" Though\\n', 'their petition was rejected, their spirit remained. When, a few years\\n', 'later, the federal Constitution was being framed, the mechanics watched\\n', 'the process with deep concern; they knew that one of its main objects\\n', 'was to promote trade and commerce, affecting directly their daily bread.\\n', 'During the struggle over ratification, they passed resolutions approving\\n', 'its provisions and they often joined in parades organized to stir up\\n', 'sentiment for the Constitution, even though they could not vote for\\n', 'members of the state conventions and so express their will directly.\\n', 'After the organization of trade unions they collided with the courts of\\n', 'law and thus became interested in the election of judges and lawmakers.\\n', '\\n', 'Those who attacked the old system of class rule found a strong moral\\n', 'support in the Declaration of Independence. Was it not said that all men\\n', 'are created equal? Whoever runs may read. Was it not declared that\\n', 'governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed?\\n', 'appropriate for use against the privileged classes of Massachusetts or\\n', 'Virginia. \"How do the principles thus proclaimed,\" asked the\\n', 'non-freeholders of Richmond, in petitioning for the ballot, \"accord with\\n', 'the equality nature ordains, creates an odious distinction between\\n', 'members of the same community ... and vests in a favored class, not in\\n', 'consideration of their public services but of their private possessions,\\n', 'the highest of all privileges.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Abolition of Property Qualifications.=--By many minor victories rather\\n', 'than by any spectacular triumphs did the advocates of manhood suffrage\\n', 'carry the day. Slight gains were made even during the Revolution or\\n', 'shortly afterward. In Pennsylvania, the mechanics, by taking an active\\n', 'part in the contest over the Constitution of 1776, were able to force\\n', 'the qualification down to the payment of a small tax. Vermont came into\\n', 'the union in 1792 without any property restrictions. In the same year\\n', 'Delaware gave the vote to all men who paid taxes. Maryland, reckoned one\\n', 'of the most conservative of states, embarked on the experiment of\\n', 'manhood suffrage in 1809; and nine years later, Connecticut, equally\\n', 'conservative, decided that all taxpayers were worthy of the ballot.\\n', '\\n', 'Five states, Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, Rhode Island, and North\\n', 'Carolina, remained obdurate while these changes were going on around\\n', 'them; finally they had to yield themselves. The last struggle in\\n', 'Massachusetts took place in the constitutional convention of 1820. There\\n', 'Webster, in the prime of his manhood, and John Adams, in the closing\\n', 'years of his old age, alike protested against such radical innovations\\n', 'as manhood suffrage. Their protests were futile. The property test was\\n', 'abolished and a small tax-paying qualification was substituted. New York\\n', 'surrendered the next year and, after trying some minor restrictions for\\n', 'five years, went completely over to white manhood suffrage in 1826.\\n', 'Rhode Island clung to her freehold qualification through thirty years of\\n', \"agitation. Then Dorr's Rebellion, almost culminating in bloodshed,\\n\", 'brought about a reform in 1843 which introduced a slight tax-paying\\n', 'qualification as an alternative to the freehold. Virginia and North\\n', 'Carolina were still unconvinced. The former refused to abandon ownership\\n', 'of land as the test for political rights until 1850 and the latter until\\n', '1856. Although religious discriminations and property qualifications for\\n', 'office holders were sometimes retained after the establishment of\\n', 'manhood suffrage, they were usually abolished along with the monopoly of\\n', 'government enjoyed by property owners and taxpayers.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'At the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century, the white\\n', 'male industrial workers and the mechanics of the Northern cities, at\\n', 'least, could lay aside the petition for the ballot and enjoy with the\\n', 'free farmer a voice in the government of their common country.\\n', '\"Universal democracy,\" sighed Carlyle, who was widely read in the United\\n', 'States, \"whatever we may think of it has declared itself the inevitable\\n', 'fact of the days in which we live; and he who has any chance to instruct\\n', 'or lead in these days must begin by admitting that ... Where no\\n', 'government is wanted, save that of the parish constable, as in America\\n', 'with its boundless soil, every man being able to find work and\\n', 'recompense for himself, democracy may subsist; not elsewhere.\" Amid the\\n', 'grave misgivings of the first generation of statesmen, America was\\n', 'committed to the great adventure, in the populous towns of the East as\\n', 'well as in the forests and fields of the West.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The spirit of the new order soon had a pronounced effect on the\\n', 'machinery of government and the practice of politics. The enfranchised\\n', 'electors were not long in demanding for themselves a larger share in\\n', 'administration.\\n', '\\n', '=The Spoils System and Rotation in Office.=--First of all they wanted\\n', 'office for themselves, regardless of their fitness. They therefore\\n', 'extended the system of rewarding party workers with government\\n', 'positions--a system early established in several states, notably New\\n', 'York and Pennsylvania. Closely connected with it was the practice of\\n', 'fixing short terms for officers and making frequent changes in\\n', 'personnel. \"Long continuance in office,\" explained a champion of this\\n', 'idea in Pennsylvania in 1837, \"unfits a man for the discharge of its\\n', 'duties, by rendering him arbitrary and aristocratic, and tends to beget,\\n', 'first life office, and then hereditary office, which leads to the\\n', 'destruction of free government.\" The solution offered was the historic\\n', 'doctrine of \"rotation in office.\" At the same time the principle of\\n', 'popular election was extended to an increasing number of officials who\\n', 'had once been appointed either by the governor or the legislature. Even\\n', 'geologists, veterinarians, surveyors, and other technical officers were\\n', 'declared elective on the theory that their appointment \"smacked of\\n', 'monarchy.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Popular Election of Presidential Electors.=--In a short time the spirit\\n', 'of democracy, while playing havoc with the old order in state\\n', 'government, made its way upward into the federal system. The framers of\\n', 'the Constitution, bewildered by many proposals and unable to agree on\\n', 'any single plan, had committed the choice of presidential electors to\\n', 'the discretion of the state legislatures. The legislatures, in turn,\\n', 'greedy of power, early adopted the practice of choosing the electors\\n', 'themselves; but they did not enjoy it long undisturbed. Democracy,\\n', 'thundering at their doors, demanded that they surrender the privilege to\\n', 'the people. Reluctantly they yielded, sometimes granting popular\\n', 'election and then withdrawing it. The drift was inevitable, and the\\n', 'climax came with the advent of Jacksonian democracy. In 1824, Vermont,\\n', 'New York, Delaware, South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana, though some\\n', 'had experimented with popular election, still left the choice of\\n', 'electors with the legislature. Eight years later South Carolina alone\\n', 'held to the old practice. Popular election had become the final word.\\n', 'The fanciful idea of an electoral college of \"good and wise men,\"\\n', 'selected without passion or partisanship by state legislatures acting as\\n', 'deliberative bodies, was exploded for all time; the election of the\\n', \"nation's chief magistrate was committed to the tempestuous methods of\\n\", 'democracy.\\n', '\\n', '=The Nominating Convention.=--As the suffrage was widened and the\\n', 'popular choice of presidential electors extended, there arose a violent\\n', 'protest against the methods used by the political parties in nominating\\n', 'candidates. After the retirement of Washington, both the Republicans and\\n', 'the Federalists found it necessary to agree upon their favorites before\\n', 'the election, and they adopted a colonial device--the pre-election\\n', 'caucus. The Federalist members of Congress held a conference and\\n', 'selected their candidate, and the Republicans followed the example. In\\n', 'a short time the practice of nominating by a \"congressional caucus\"\\n', 'became a recognized institution. The election still remained with the\\n', 'people; but the power of picking candidates for their approval passed\\n', 'into the hands of a small body of Senators and Representatives.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'people,\" like Andrew Jackson, it was intolerable, all the more so\\n', 'because the caucus never favored him with the nomination. More\\n', 'conservative men also found grave objections to it. They pointed out\\n', 'that, whereas the Constitution intended the President to be an\\n', 'independent officer, he had now fallen under the control of a caucus of\\n', 'congressmen. The supremacy of the legislative branch had been obtained\\n', 'by an extra-legal political device. To such objections were added\\n', 'practical considerations. In 1824, when personal rivalry had taken the\\n', 'place of party conflicts, the congressional caucus selected as the\\n', 'great popularity, passing by such an obvious hero as General Jackson.\\n', 'The followers of the General were enraged and demanded nothing short of\\n', 'the death of \"King Caucus.\" Their clamor was effective. Under their\\n', 'attacks, the caucus came to an ignominious end.\\n', '\\n', 'In place of it there arose in 1831 a new device, the national nominating\\n', 'convention, composed of delegates elected by party voters for the sole\\n', 'purpose of nominating candidates. Senators and Representatives were\\n', 'still prominent in the party councils, but they were swamped by hundreds\\n', 'of delegates \"fresh from the people,\" as Jackson was wont to say. In\\n', 'fact, each convention was made up mainly of office holders and office\\n', 'seekers, and the new institution was soon denounced as vigorously as\\n', 'King Caucus had been, particularly by statesmen who failed to obtain a\\n', 'nomination. Still it grew in strength and by 1840 was firmly\\n', 'established.\\n', '\\n', '=The End of the Old Generation.=--In the election of 1824, the\\n', 'representatives of the \"aristocracy\" made their last successful stand.\\n', 'Until then the leadership by men of \"wealth and talents\" had been\\n', 'undisputed. There had been five Presidents--Washington, John Adams,\\n', 'Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe--all Eastern men brought up in prosperous\\n', 'families with the advantages of culture which come from leisure and the\\n', \"possession of life's refinements. None of them had ever been compelled\\n\", 'to work with his hands for a livelihood. Four of them had been\\n', 'slaveholders. Jefferson was a philosopher, learned in natural science, a\\n', 'master of foreign languages, a gentleman of dignity and grace of manner,\\n', 'notwithstanding his studied simplicity. Madison, it was said, was armed\\n', '\"with all the culture of his century.\" Monroe was a graduate of William\\n', 'and Mary, a gentleman of the old school. Jefferson and his three\\n', 'successors called themselves Republicans and professed a genuine faith\\n', 'in the people but they were not \"of the people\" themselves; they were\\n', 'not sons of the soil or the workshop. They were all men of \"the grand\\n', '\\n', 'old order of society\" who gave finish and style even to popular\\n', 'government.\\n', '\\n', 'Monroe was the last of the Presidents belonging to the heroic epoch of\\n', 'the Revolution. He had served in the war for independence, in the\\n', 'Congress under the Articles of Confederation, and in official capacity\\n', 'after the adoption of the Constitution. In short, he was of the age that\\n', 'had wrought American independence and set the government afloat. With\\n', 'his passing, leadership went to a new generation; but his successor,\\n', 'John Quincy Adams, formed a bridge between the old and the new in that\\n', 'he combined a high degree of culture with democratic sympathies.\\n', 'Washington had died in 1799, preceded but a few months by Patrick Henry\\n', 'and followed in four years by Samuel Adams. Hamilton had been killed in\\n', 'a duel with Burr in 1804. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were yet alive\\n', 'in 1824 but they were soon to pass from the scene, reconciled at last,\\n', 'full of years and honors. Madison was in dignified retirement, destined\\n', 'to live long enough to protest against the doctrine of nullification\\n', 'proclaimed by South Carolina before death carried him away at the ripe\\n', 'old age of eighty-five.\\n', '\\n', '=The Election of John Quincy Adams (1824).=--The campaign of 1824 marked\\n', 'the end of the \"era of good feeling\" inaugurated by the collapse of the\\n', 'Federalist party after the election of 1816. There were four leading\\n', 'Crawford. The result of the election was a division of the electoral\\n', 'votes into four parts and no one received a majority. Under the\\n', 'Constitution, therefore, the selection of President passed to the House\\n', 'of Representatives. Clay, who stood at the bottom of the poll, threw his\\n', 'weight to Adams and assured his triumph, much to the chagrin of\\n', \"Jackson's friends. They thought, with a certain justification, that\\n\", 'inasmuch as the hero of New Orleans had received the largest electoral\\n', 'vote, the House was morally bound to accept the popular judgment and\\n', 'make him President. Jackson shook hands cordially with Adams on the day\\n', 'of the inauguration, but never forgave him for being elected.\\n', '\\n', 'While Adams called himself a Republican in politics and often spoke of\\n', '\"the rule of the people,\" he was regarded by Jackson\\'s followers as \"an\\n', 'aristocrat.\" He was not a son of the soil. Neither was he acquainted at\\n', 'first hand with the labor of farmers and mechanics. He had been educated\\n', 'at Harvard and in Europe. Like his illustrious father, John Adams, he\\n', 'was a stern and reserved man, little given to seeking popularity.\\n', 'Moreover, he was from the East and the frontiersmen of the West regarded\\n', 'him as a man \"born with a silver spoon in his mouth.\" Jackson\\'s\\n', 'supporters especially disliked him because they thought their hero\\n', 'entitled to the presidency. Their anger was deepened when Adams\\n', 'appointed Clay to the office of Secretary of State; and they set up a\\n', 'cry that there had been a \"deal\" by which Clay had helped to elect Adams\\n', 'to get office for himself.\\n', '\\n', 'Though Adams conducted his administration with great dignity and in a\\n', 'fine spirit of public service, he was unable to overcome the opposition\\n', 'which he encountered on his election to office or to win popularity in\\n', 'the West and South. On the contrary, by advocating government assistance\\n', 'in building roads and canals and public grants in aid of education,\\n', 'arts, and sciences, he ran counter to the current which had set in\\n', 'against appropriations of federal funds for internal improvements. By\\n', 'signing the Tariff Bill of 1828, soon known as the \"Tariff of\\n', 'Abominations,\" he made new enemies without adding to his friends in New\\n', 'York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio where he sorely needed them. Handicapped by\\n', 'the false charge that he had been a party to a \"corrupt bargain\" with\\n', 'Clay to secure his first election; attacked for his advocacy of a high\\n', 'protective tariff; charged with favoring an \"aristocracy of\\n', 'office-holders\" in Washington on account of his refusal to discharge\\n', 'government clerks by the wholesale, Adams was retired from the White\\n', 'House after he had served four years.\\n', '\\n', '=The Triumph of Jackson in 1828.=--Probably no candidate for the\\n', 'presidency ever had such passionate popular support as Andrew Jackson\\n', 'had in 1828. He was truly a man of the people. Born of poor parents in\\n', 'the upland region of South Carolina, schooled in poverty and adversity,\\n', 'without the advantages of education or the refinements of cultivated\\n', 'leisure, he seemed the embodiment of the spirit of the new American\\n', 'democracy. Early in his youth he had gone into the frontier of Tennessee\\n', 'where he soon won a name as a fearless and intrepid Indian fighter. On\\n', 'the march and in camp, he endeared himself to his men by sharing their\\n', 'hardships, sleeping on the ground with them, and eating parched corn\\n', 'when nothing better could be found for the privates. From local\\n', 'prominence he sprang into national fame by his exploit at the battle of\\n', 'New Orleans. His reputation as a military hero was enhanced by the\\n', 'feeling that he had been a martyr to political treachery in 1824. The\\n', 'farmers of the West and South claimed him as their own. The mechanics of\\n', 'the Eastern cities, newly enfranchised, also looked upon him as their\\n', 'friend. Though his views on the tariff, internal improvements, and other\\n', 'issues before the country were either vague or unknown, he was readily\\n', 'elected President.\\n', '\\n', 'The returns of the electoral vote in 1828 revealed the sources of\\n', \"Jackson's power. In New England, he received but one ballot, from\\n\", 'Maine; he had a majority of the electors in New York and all of them in\\n', 'Pennsylvania; and he carried every state south of Maryland and beyond\\n', 'the Appalachians. Adams did not get a single electoral vote in the South\\n', 'and West. The prophecy of the Hartford convention had been fulfilled.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'When Jackson took the oath of office on March 4, 1829, the government of\\n', 'the United States entered into a new era. Until this time the\\n', 'inauguration of a President--even that of Jefferson, the apostle of\\n', 'simplicity--had brought no rude shock to the course of affairs at the\\n', 'capital. Hitherto the installation of a President meant that an\\n', 'old-fashioned gentleman, accompanied by a few servants, had driven to\\n', 'the White House in his own coach, taken the oath with quiet dignity,\\n', 'appointed a few new men to the higher posts, continued in office the\\n', 'long list of regular civil employees, and begun his administration with\\n', 'respectable decorum. Jackson changed all this. When he was inaugurated,\\n', 'men and women journeyed hundreds of miles to witness the ceremony. Great\\n', 'throngs pressed into the White House, \"upset the bowls of punch, broke\\n', 'the glasses, and stood with their muddy boots on the satin-covered\\n', 'chairs to see the people\\'s President.\" If Jefferson\\'s inauguration was,\\n', 'as he called it, the \"great revolution,\" Jackson\\'s inauguration was a\\n', 'cataclysm.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Spoils System.=--The staid and respectable society of Washington\\n', 'was disturbed by this influx of farmers and frontiersmen. To speak of\\n', 'politics became \"bad form\" among fashionable women. The clerks and\\n', 'civil servants of the government who had enjoyed long and secure tenure\\n', 'of office became alarmed at the clamor of new men for their positions.\\n', 'Doubtless the major portion of them had opposed the election of Jackson\\n', 'and looked with feelings akin to contempt upon him and his followers.\\n', \"With a hunter's instinct, Jackson scented his prey. Determined to have\\n\", 'none but his friends in office, he made a clean sweep, expelling old\\n', 'employees to make room for men \"fresh from the people.\" This was a new\\n', 'custom. Other Presidents had discharged a few officers for engaging in\\n', 'opposition politics. They had been careful in making appointments not to\\n', 'choose inveterate enemies; but they discharged relatively few men on\\n', 'account of their political views and partisan activities.\\n', '\\n', 'By wholesale removals and the frank selection of officers on party\\n', 'grounds--a practice already well intrenched in New York--Jackson\\n', 'established the \"spoils system\" at Washington. The famous slogan, \"to\\n', 'the victor belong the spoils of victory,\" became the avowed principle of\\n', 'the national government. Statesmen like Calhoun denounced it; poets like\\n', 'James Russell Lowell ridiculed it; faithful servants of the government\\n', 'suffered under it; but it held undisturbed sway for half a century\\n', 'thereafter, each succeeding generation outdoing, if possible, its\\n', 'predecessor in the use of public office for political purposes. If any\\n', 'one remarked that training and experience were necessary qualifications\\n', \"for important public positions, he met Jackson's own profession of\\n\", 'faith: \"The duties of any public office are so simple or admit of being\\n', 'made so simple that any man can in a short time become master of them.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Tariff and Nullification.=--Jackson had not been installed in power\\n', \"very long before he was compelled to choose between states' rights and\\n\", 'nationalism. The immediate occasion of the trouble was the tariff--a\\n', 'matter on which Jackson did not have any very decided views. His mind\\n', 'did not run naturally to abstruse economic questions; and owing to the\\n', 'divided opinion of the country it was \"good politics\" to be vague and\\n', 'ambiguous in the controversy. Especially was this true, because the\\n', 'tariff issue was threatening to split the country into parties again.\\n', '\\n', '_The Development of the Policy of \"Protection.\"_--The war of 1812 and\\n', 'the commercial policies of England which followed it had accentuated the\\n', 'need for American economic independence. During that conflict, the\\n', 'United States, cut off from English manufactures as during the\\n', 'Revolution, built up home industries to meet the unusual call for iron,\\n', 'steel, cloth, and other military and naval supplies as well as the\\n', 'demands from ordinary markets. Iron foundries and textile mills sprang\\n', 'up as in the night; hundreds of business men invested fortunes in\\n', 'industrial enterprises so essential to the military needs of the\\n', 'government; and the people at large fell into the habit of buying\\n', 'American-made goods again. As the London _Times_ tersely observed of the\\n', 'Americans, \"their first war with England made them independent; their\\n', 'second war made them formidable.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In recognition of this state of affairs, the tariff of 1816 was\\n', 'designed: _first_, to prevent England from ruining these \"infant\\n', 'industries\" by dumping the accumulated stores of years suddenly upon\\n', 'American markets; and, _secondly_, to enlarge in the manufacturing\\n', 'centers the demand for American agricultural produce. It accomplished\\n', 'the purposes of its framers. It kept in operation the mills and furnaces\\n', 'so recently built. It multiplied the number of industrial workers and\\n', 'enhanced the demand for the produce of the soil. It brought about\\n', 'another very important result. It turned the capital and enterprise of\\n', 'New England from shipping to manufacturing, and converted her statesmen,\\n', 'once friends of low tariffs, into ardent advocates of protection.\\n', '\\n', 'In the early years of the nineteenth century, the Yankees had bent their\\n', 'energies toward building and operating ships to carry produce from\\n', 'America to Europe and manufactures from Europe to America. For this\\n', 'reason, they had opposed the tariff of 1816 calculated to increase\\n', 'domestic production and cut down the carrying trade. Defeated in their\\n', 'efforts, they accepted the inevitable and turned to manufacturing. Soon\\n', 'they were powerful friends of protection for American enterprise. As the\\n', 'money invested and the labor employed in the favored industries\\n', 'increased, the demand for continued and heavier protection grew apace.\\n', 'Even the farmers who furnished raw materials, like wool, flax, and hemp,\\n', 'began to see eye to eye with the manufacturers. So the textile interests\\n', 'of New England, the iron masters of Connecticut, New Jersey, and\\n', 'Pennsylvania, the wool, hemp, and flax growers of Ohio, Kentucky, and\\n', 'Tennessee, and the sugar planters of Louisiana developed into a\\n', 'formidable combination in support of a high protective tariff.\\n', '\\n', 'states on the seaboard had forgotten about the havoc wrought during the\\n', 'Napoleonic wars when their produce rotted because there were no ships to\\n', 'carry it to Europe. The seas were now open. The area devoted to cotton\\n', 'had swiftly expanded as Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana were opened\\n', 'up. Cotton had in fact become \"king\" and the planters depended for their\\n', 'prosperity, as they thought, upon the sale of their staple to English\\n', 'manufacturers whose spinning and weaving mills were the wonder of the\\n', 'world. Manufacturing nothing and having to buy nearly everything except\\n', 'farm produce and even much of that for slaves, the planters naturally\\n', 'wanted to purchase manufactures in the cheapest market, England, where\\n', 'they sold most of their cotton. The tariff, they contended, raised the\\n', 'price of the goods they had to buy and was thus in fact a tribute laid\\n', 'on them for the benefit of the Northern mill owners.\\n', '\\n', 'again in 1828 when Northern manufacturers and Western farmers forced\\n', 'Congress to make an upward revision of the tariff. The Act of 1828 known\\n', 'as \"the Tariff of Abominations,\" though slightly modified in 1832, was\\n', '\"the straw which broke the camel\\'s back.\" Southern leaders turned in\\n', 'rage against the whole system. The legislatures of Virginia, North\\n', 'Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama denounced it; a general\\n', 'convention of delegates held at Augusta issued a protest of defiance\\n', 'against it; and South Carolina, weary of verbal battles, decided to\\n', 'prevent its enforcement.\\n', '\\n', 'on October 26, 1832, passed a bill calling for a state convention which\\n', 'duly assembled in the following month. In no mood for compromise, it\\n', \"adopted the famous Ordinance of Nullification after a few days' debate.\\n\", 'Every line of this document was clear and firm. The tariff, it opened,\\n', 'gives \"bounties to classes and individuals ... at the expense and to the\\n', 'injury and oppression of other classes and individuals\"; it is a\\n', 'violation of the Constitution of the United States and therefore null\\n', 'and void; its enforcement in South Carolina is unlawful; if the federal\\n', 'government attempts to coerce the state into obeying the law, \"the\\n', 'people of this state will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all\\n', 'further obligations to maintain or preserve their political connection\\n', 'with the people of the other states and will forthwith proceed to\\n', 'organize a separate government and do all other acts and things which\\n', 'sovereign and independent states may of right do.\"\\n', '\\n', 'this note of defiance, couched in the language used in the Kentucky\\n', 'resolutions and by the New England Federalists during the war of 1812,\\n', 'was quick and positive. The legislatures of the Southern states, while\\n', 'condemning the tariff, repudiated the step which South Carolina had\\n', 'taken. Georgia responded: \"We abhor the doctrine of nullification as\\n', 'neither a peaceful nor a constitutional remedy.\" Alabama found it\\n', '\"unsound in theory and dangerous in practice.\" North Carolina replied\\n', 'that it was \"revolutionary in character, subversive of the Constitution\\n', 'of the United States.\" Mississippi answered: \"It is disunion by\\n', 'force--it is civil war.\" Virginia spoke more softly, condemning the\\n', 'tariff and sustaining the principle of the Virginia resolutions but\\n', 'denying that South Carolina could find in them any sanction for her\\n', 'proceedings.\\n', '\\n', 'upon Andrew Jackson. It was known that he looked with no friendly\\n', 'feelings upon nullification, for, at a Jefferson dinner in the spring of\\n', '1830 while the subject was in the air, he had with laconic firmness\\n', 'announced a toast: \"Our federal union; it must be preserved.\" When two\\n', 'years later the open challenge came from South Carolina, he replied that\\n', 'he would enforce the law, saying with his frontier directness: \"If a\\n', 'single drop of blood shall be shed there in opposition to the laws of\\n', 'ready to keep his word by preparing for the use of military and naval\\n', 'forces in sustaining the authority of the federal government. Then in a\\n', 'long and impassioned proclamation to the people of South Carolina he\\n', 'pointed out the national character of the union, and announced his\\n', 'solemn resolve to preserve it by all constitutional means. Nullification\\n', 'he branded as \"incompatible with the existence of the union,\\n', 'contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized\\n', 'by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was\\n', 'founded, and destructive of the great objects for which it was formed.\"\\n', '\\n', 'suggested that protection should be limited to the articles of domestic\\n', 'manufacture indispensable to safety in war time, and shortly afterward\\n', 'he asked for new legislation to aid him in enforcing the laws. With two\\n', 'propositions before it, one to remove the chief grounds for South\\n', \"Carolina's resistance and the other to apply force if it was continued,\\n\", 'Congress bent its efforts to avoid a crisis. On February 12, 1833,\\n', 'Henry Clay laid before the Senate a compromise tariff bill providing for\\n', 'the gradual reduction of the duties until by 1842 they would reach the\\n', 'level of the law which Calhoun had supported in 1816. About the same\\n', 'time the \"force bill,\" designed to give the President ample authority in\\n', 'executing the law in South Carolina, was taken up. After a short but\\n', 'acrimonious debate, both measures were passed and signed by President\\n', 'Jackson on the same day, March 2. Looking upon the reduction of the\\n', 'tariff as a complete vindication of her policy and an undoubted victory,\\n', 'South Carolina rescinded her ordinance and enacted another nullifying\\n', 'the force bill.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'quarrel, long the subject of high dispute, need not concern us to-day.\\n', 'Perhaps the chief result of the whole affair was a clarification of the\\n', 'issue between the North and the South--a definite statement of the\\n', 'principles for which men on both sides were years afterward to lay down\\n', 'their lives. On behalf of nationalism and a perpetual union, the stanch\\n', 'old Democrat from Tennessee had, in his proclamation on nullification,\\n', 'spoken a language that admitted of only one meaning. On behalf of\\n', 'nullification, Senator Hayne, of South Carolina, a skilled lawyer and\\n', 'courtly orator, had in a great speech delivered in the Senate in\\n', 'January, 1830, set forth clearly and cogently the doctrine that the\\n', 'union is a compact among sovereign states from which the parties may\\n', 'lawfully withdraw. It was this address that called into the arena\\n', 'Daniel Webster, Senator from Massachusetts, who, spreading the mantle\\n', 'of oblivion over the Hartford convention, delivered a reply to Hayne\\n', 'that has been reckoned among the powerful orations of all time--a plea\\n', 'for the supremacy of the Constitution and the national character of the\\n', 'union.\\n', '\\n', '=The War on the United States Bank.=--If events forced the issue of\\n', 'nationalism and nullification upon Jackson, the same could not be said\\n', 'of his attack on the bank. That institution, once denounced by every\\n', 'true Jeffersonian, had been reestablished in 1816 under the\\n', \"administration of Jefferson's disciple, James Madison. It had not been\\n\", 'in operation very long, however, before it aroused bitter opposition,\\n', 'especially in the South and the West. Its notes drove out of circulation\\n', 'the paper currency of unsound banks chartered by the states, to the\\n', 'great anger of local financiers. It was accused of favoritism in making\\n', 'loans, of conferring special privileges upon politicians in return for\\n', 'their support at Washington. To all Jackson\\'s followers it was \"an\\n', 'insidious money power.\" One of them openly denounced it as an\\n', 'institution designed \"to strengthen the arm of wealth and counterpoise\\n', 'the influence of extended suffrage in the disposition of public\\n', 'affairs.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This sentiment President Jackson fully shared. In his first message to\\n', 'Congress he assailed the bank in vigorous language. He declared that its\\n', 'constitutionality was in doubt and alleged that it had failed to\\n', 'establish a sound and uniform currency. If such an institution was\\n', 'necessary, he continued, it should be a public bank, owned and managed\\n', 'by the government, not a private concern endowed with special privileges\\n', 'by it. In his second and third messages, Jackson came back to the\\n', 'subject, leaving the decision, however, to \"an enlightened people and\\n', 'their representatives.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Moved by this frank hostility and anxious for the future, the bank\\n', 'applied to Congress for a renewal of its charter in 1832, four years\\n', 'before the expiration of its life. Clay, with his eye upon the\\n', 'presidency and an issue for the campaign, warmly supported the\\n', 'application. Congress, deeply impressed by his leadership, passed the\\n', 'bill granting the new charter, and sent the open defiance to Jackson.\\n', 'His response was an instant veto. The battle was on and it raged with\\n', 'fury until the close of his second administration, ending in the\\n', 'destruction of the bank, a disordered currency, and a national panic.\\n', '\\n', 'In his veto message, Jackson attacked the bank as unconstitutional and\\n', 'even hinted at corruption. He refused to assent to the proposition that\\n', 'the Supreme Court had settled the question of constitutionality by the\\n', 'decision in the McCulloch case. \"Each public officer,\" he argued, \"who\\n', 'takes an oath to support the Constitution, swears that he will support\\n', 'it as he understands it, not as it is understood by others.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Not satisfied with his veto and his declaration against the bank,\\n', 'Jackson ordered the Secretary of the Treasury to withdraw the government\\n', \"deposits which formed a large part of the institution's funds. This\\n\", 'action he followed up by an open charge that the bank had used money\\n', 'shamefully to secure the return of its supporters to Congress. The\\n', 'Senate, stung by this charge, solemnly resolved that Jackson had\\n', '\"assumed upon himself authority and power not conferred by the\\n', 'Constitution and laws, but in derogation of both.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The effects of the destruction of the bank were widespread. When its\\n', 'charter expired in 1836, banking was once more committed to the control\\n', 'of the states. The state legislatures, under a decision rendered by the\\n', 'Supreme Court after the death of Marshall, began to charter banks under\\n', 'state ownership and control, with full power to issue paper money--this\\n', 'in spite of the provision in the Constitution that states shall not\\n', 'issue bills of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin legal\\n', 'tender in the payment of debts. Once more the country was flooded by\\n', 'paper currency of uncertain value. To make matters worse, Jackson\\n', 'adopted the practice of depositing huge amounts of government funds in\\n', 'these banks, not forgetting to render favors to those institutions which\\n', 'supported him in politics--\"pet banks,\" as they were styled at the\\n', 'time. In 1837, partially, though by no means entirely, as a result of\\n', 'the abolition of the bank, the country was plunged into one of the most\\n', 'disastrous panics which it ever experienced.\\n', '\\n', '=Internal Improvements Checked.=--The bank had presented to Jackson a\\n', 'very clear problem--one of destruction. Other questions were not so\\n', 'simple, particularly the subject of federal appropriations in aid of\\n', 'roads and other internal improvements. Jefferson had strongly favored\\n', 'government assistance in such matters, but his administration was\\n', 'followed by a reaction. Both Madison and Monroe vetoed acts of Congress\\n', 'appropriating public funds for public roads, advancing as their reason\\n', 'the argument that the Constitution authorized no such laws. Jackson,\\n', 'puzzled by the clamor on both sides, followed their example without\\n', 'making the constitutional bar absolute. Congress, he thought, might\\n', 'lawfully build highways of a national and military value, but he\\n', 'strongly deprecated attacks by local interests on the federal treasury.\\n', '\\n', \"=The Triumph of the Executive Branch.=--Jackson's reelection in 1832\\n\", 'served to confirm his opinion that he was the chosen leader of the\\n', 'people, freed and instructed to ride rough shod over Congress and even\\n', 'the courts. No President before or since ever entertained in times of\\n', 'peace such lofty notions of executive prerogative. The entire body of\\n', 'federal employees he transformed into obedient servants of his wishes, a\\n', 'sign or a nod from him making and undoing the fortunes of the humble and\\n', 'the mighty. His lawful cabinet of advisers, filling all of the high\\n', 'posts in the government, he treated with scant courtesy, preferring\\n', 'rather to secure his counsel and advice from an unofficial body of\\n', 'friends and dependents who, owing to their secret methods and back\\n', 'stairs arrangements, became known as \"the kitchen cabinet.\" Under the\\n', 'leadership of a silent, astute, and resourceful politician, Amos\\n', 'Kendall, this informal gathering of the faithful both gave and carried\\n', \"out decrees and orders, communicating the President's lightest wish or\\n\", 'strictest command to the uttermost part of the country. Resolutely and\\n', 'in the face of bitter opposition Jackson had removed the deposits from\\n', 'the United States Bank. When the Senate protested against this arbitrary\\n', 'conduct, he did not rest until it was forced to expunge the resolution\\n', 'of condemnation; in time one of his lieutenants with his own hands was\\n', 'able to tear the censure from the records. When Chief Justice Marshall\\n', 'issued a decree against Georgia which did not suit him, Jackson,\\n', 'according to tradition, blurted out that Marshall could go ahead and\\n', 'enforce his own orders. To the end he pursued his willful way, finally\\n', 'even choosing his own successor.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"=Jackson's Measures Arouse Opposition.=--Measures so decided, policies\\n\", 'so radical, and conduct so high-handed could not fail to arouse against\\n', 'Jackson a deep and exasperated opposition. The truth is the conduct of\\n', 'his entire administration profoundly disturbed the business and finances\\n', 'of the country. It was accompanied by conditions similar to those which\\n', 'unstable and irritating as the worthless notes of revolutionary days,\\n', 'flooded the country, hindering the easy transaction of business. The use\\n', 'of federal funds for internal improvements, so vital to the exchange of\\n', 'commodities which is the very life of industry, was blocked by executive\\n', 'vetoes. The Supreme Court, which, under Marshall, had held refractory\\n', \"states to their obligations under the Constitution, was flouted; states'\\n\", 'rights judges, deliberately selected by Jackson for the bench, began to\\n', 'sap and undermine the rulings of Marshall. The protective tariff, under\\n', 'which the textile industry of New England, the iron mills of\\n', 'Pennsylvania, and the wool, flax, and hemp farms of the West had\\n', 'flourished, had received a severe blow in the compromise of 1833 which\\n', \"promised a steady reduction of duties. To cap the climax, Jackson's\\n\", 'party, casting aside the old and reputable name of Republican, boldly\\n', 'chose for its title the term \"Democrat,\" throwing down the gauntlet to\\n', 'every conservative who doubted the omniscience of the people. All these\\n', 'things worked together to evoke an opposition that was sharp and\\n', 'determined.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Clay and the National Republicans.=--In this opposition movement,\\n', 'leadership fell to Henry Clay, a son of Kentucky, rather than to Daniel\\n', 'Webster of Massachusetts. Like Jackson, Clay was born in a home haunted\\n', 'by poverty. Left fatherless early and thrown upon his own resources, he\\n', 'went from Virginia into Kentucky where by sheer force of intellect he\\n', 'rose to eminence in the profession of law. Without the martial gifts or\\n', 'the martial spirit of Jackson, he slipped more easily into the social\\n', 'habits of the East at the same time that he retained his hold on the\\n', 'affections of the boisterous West. Farmers of Ohio, Indiana, and\\n', 'Kentucky loved him; financiers of New York and Philadelphia trusted him.\\n', 'He was thus a leader well fitted to gather the forces of opposition\\n', 'into union against Jackson.\\n', '\\n', \"Around Clay's standard assembled a motley collection, representing every\\n\", 'species of political opinion, united by one tie only--hatred for \"Old\\n', 'Hickory.\" Nullifiers and less strenuous advocates of states\\' rights were\\n', \"yoked with nationalists of Webster's school; ardent protectionists were\\n\", 'bound together with equally ardent free traders, all fraternizing in one\\n', 'grand confusion of ideas under the title of \"National Republicans.\" Thus\\n', 'the ancient and honorable term selected by Jefferson and his party, now\\n', 'abandoned by Jacksonian Democracy, was adroitly adopted to cover the\\n', 'supporters of Clay. The platform of the party, however, embraced all the\\n', 'old Federalist principles: protection for American industry; internal\\n', 'improvements; respect for the Supreme Court; resistance to executive\\n', 'tyranny; and denunciation of the spoils system. Though Jackson was\\n', 'easily victorious in 1832, the popular vote cast for Clay should have\\n', 'given him some doubts about the faith of \"the whole people\" in the\\n', 'wisdom of his \"reign.\"\\n', '\\n', \"=Van Buren and the Panic of 1837.=--Nothing could shake the General's\\n\", 'superb confidence. At the end of his second term he insisted on\\n', 'selecting his own successor; at a national convention, chosen by party\\n', 'voters, but packed with his office holders and friends, he nominated\\n', 'Martin Van Buren of New York. Once more he proved his strength by\\n', 'carrying the country for the Democrats. With a fine flourish, he\\n', 'attended the inauguration of Van Buren and then retired, amid the\\n', 'applause and tears of his devotees, to the Hermitage, his home in\\n', 'Tennessee.\\n', '\\n', 'Fortunately for him, Jackson escaped the odium of a disastrous panic\\n', 'which struck the country with terrible force in the following summer.\\n', 'Among the contributory causes of this crisis, no doubt, were the\\n', 'destruction of the bank and the issuance of the \"specie circular\" of\\n', '\\n', '1836 which required the purchasers of public lands to pay for them in\\n', 'coin, instead of the paper notes of state banks. Whatever the dominating\\n', 'cause, the ruin was widespread. Bank after bank went under; boom towns\\n', 'in the West collapsed; Eastern mills shut down; and working people in\\n', 'the industrial centers, starving from unemployment, begged for relief.\\n', 'Van Buren braved the storm, offering no measure of reform or assistance\\n', 'to the distracted people. He did seek security for government funds by\\n', 'suggesting the removal of deposits from private banks and the\\n', 'establishment of an independent treasury system, with government\\n', 'depositaries for public funds, in several leading cities. This plan was\\n', 'finally accepted by Congress in 1840.\\n', '\\n', 'Had Van Buren been a captivating figure he might have lived down the\\n', 'discredit of the panic unjustly laid at his door; but he was far from\\n', 'being a favorite with the populace. Though a man of many talents, he\\n', 'owed his position to the quiet and adept management of Jackson rather\\n', 'than to his own personal qualities. The men of the frontier did not care\\n', 'for him. They suspected that he ate from \"gold plate\" and they could not\\n', 'forgive him for being an astute politician from New York. Still the\\n', \"Democratic party, remembering Jackson's wishes, renominated him\\n\", 'unanimously in 1840 and saw him go down to utter defeat.\\n', '\\n', '=The Whigs and General Harrison.=--By this time, the National\\n', 'Republicans, now known as Whigs--a title taken from the party of\\n', 'opposition to the Crown in England, had learned many lessons. Taking a\\n', 'leaf out of the Democratic book, they nominated, not Clay of Kentucky,\\n', 'well known for his views on the bank, the tariff, and internal\\n', 'improvements, but a military hero, General William Henry Harrison, a man\\n', 'of uncertain political opinions. Harrison, a son of a Virginia signer of\\n', 'the Declaration of Independence, sprang into public view by winning a\\n', 'battle more famous than important, \"Tippecanoe\"--a brush with the\\n', 'Indians in Indiana. He added to his laurels by rendering praiseworthy\\n', 'services during the war of 1812. When days of peace returned he was\\n', 'rewarded by a grateful people with a seat in Congress. Then he retired\\n', 'to quiet life in a little village near Cincinnati. Like Jackson he was\\n', 'held to be a son of the South and the West. Like Jackson he was a\\n', 'military hero, a lesser light, but still a light. Like Old Hickory he\\n', 'rode into office on a tide of popular feeling against an Eastern man\\n', 'accused of being something of an aristocrat. His personal popularity was\\n', 'sufficient. The Whigs who nominated him shrewdly refused to adopt a\\n', 'platform or declare their belief in anything. When some Democrat\\n', 'asserted that Harrison was a backwoodsman whose sole wants were a jug of\\n', 'hard cider and a log cabin, the Whigs treated the remark not as an\\n', 'insult but as proof positive that Harrison deserved the votes of Jackson\\n', 'men. The jug and the cabin they proudly transformed into symbols of the\\n', 'campaign, and won for their chieftain 234 electoral votes, while Van\\n', 'Buren got only sixty.\\n', '\\n', '=Harrison and Tyler.=--The Hero of Tippecanoe was not long to enjoy the\\n', 'fruits of his victory. The hungry horde of Whig office seekers descended\\n', 'upon him like wolves upon the fold. If he went out they waylaid him; if\\n', 'he stayed indoors, he was besieged; not even his bed chamber was spared.\\n', 'He was none too strong at best and he took a deep cold on the day of his\\n', 'inauguration. Between driving out Democrats and appeasing Whigs, he fell\\n', 'mortally ill. Before the end of a month he lay dead at the capitol.\\n', '\\n', \"Harrison's successor, John Tyler, the Vice President, whom the Whigs had\\n\", 'nominated to catch votes in Virginia, was more of a Democrat than\\n', 'anything else, though he was not partisan enough to please anybody. The\\n', 'Whigs railed at him because he would not approve the founding of another\\n', 'United States Bank. The Democrats stormed at him for refusing, until\\n', 'near the end of his term, to sanction the annexation of Texas, which had\\n', 'declared its independence of Mexico in 1836. His entire administration,\\n', 'marked by unseemly wrangling, produced only two measures of importance.\\n', 'The Whigs, flushed by victory, with the aid of a few protectionist\\n', 'Democrats, enacted, in 1842, a new tariff law destroying the compromise\\n', 'which had brought about the truce between the North and the South, in\\n', 'the days of nullification. The distinguished leader of the Whigs, Daniel\\n', 'Webster, as Secretary of State, in negotiation with Lord Ashburton\\n', 'representing Great Britain, settled the long-standing dispute between\\n', 'chapter in American diplomacy, Webster withdrew to private life, leaving\\n', 'the President to endure alone the buffets of political fortune.\\n', '\\n', 'To the end, the Whigs regarded Tyler as a traitor to their cause; but\\n', 'the judgment of history is that it was a case of the biter bitten. They\\n', 'had nominated him for the vice presidency as a man of views acceptable\\n', 'to Southern Democrats in order to catch their votes, little reckoning\\n', 'with the chances of his becoming President. Tyler had not deceived them\\n', 'and, thoroughly soured, he left the White House in 1845 not to appear in\\n', 'public life again until the days of secession, when he espoused the\\n', 'Southern confederacy. Jacksonian Democracy, with new leadership, serving\\n', 'through the hour glass before the Whig party was to be broken and\\n', 'scattered as the Federalists had been more than a generation before.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Democracy in England and France.=--During the period of Jacksonian\\n', 'Democracy, as in all epochs of ferment, there was a close relation\\n', 'between the thought of the New World and the Old. In England, the\\n', 'successes of the American experiment were used as arguments in favor of\\n', 'effect against America half a century before. In the United States, on\\n', 'the other hand, conservatives like Chancellor Kent, the stout opponent\\n', 'of manhood suffrage in New York, cited the riots of the British working\\n', 'classes as a warning against admitting the same classes to a share in\\n', 'the government of the United States. Along with the agitation of opinion\\n', \"went epoch-making events. In 1832, the year of Jackson's second\\n\", 'triumph, the British Parliament passed its first reform bill, which\\n', 'conferred the ballot--not on workingmen as yet--but on mill owners and\\n', 'shopkeepers whom the landlords regarded with genuine horror. The initial\\n', 'step was thus taken in breaking down the privileges of the landed\\n', 'aristocracy and the rich merchants of England.\\n', '\\n', 'About the same time a popular revolution occurred in France. The Bourbon\\n', 'family, restored to the throne of France by the allied powers after\\n', 'their victory over Napoleon in 1815, had embarked upon a policy of\\n', 'arbitrary government. To use the familiar phrase, they had learned\\n', '1824, set to work with zeal to undo the results of the French\\n', 'Revolution, to stifle the press, restrict the suffrage, and restore the\\n', 'clergy and the nobility to their ancient rights. His policy encountered\\n', 'equally zealous opposition and in 1830 he was overthrown. The popular\\n', 'party, under the leadership of Lafayette, established, not a republic as\\n', 'some of the radicals had hoped, but a \"liberal\" middle-class monarchy\\n', 'under Louis Philippe. This second French Revolution made a profound\\n', 'impression on Americans, convincing them that the whole world was moving\\n', 'toward democracy. The mayor, aldermen, and citizens of New York City\\n', 'joined in a great parade to celebrate the fall of the Bourbons. Mingled\\n', 'with cheers for the new order in France were hurrahs for \"the people\\'s\\n', 'own, Andrew Jackson, the Hero of New Orleans and President of the United\\n', 'States!\"\\n', '\\n', '=European Interest in America.=--To the older and more settled\\n', 'Europeans, the democratic experiment in America was either a menace or\\n', 'an inspiration. Conservatives viewed it with anxiety; liberals with\\n', 'optimism. Far-sighted leaders could see that the tide of democracy was\\n', 'rising all over the world and could not be stayed. Naturally the country\\n', 'that had advanced furthest along the new course was the place in which\\n', 'to find arguments for and against proposals that Europe should make\\n', 'experiments of the same character.\\n', '\\n', \"=De Tocqueville's _Democracy in America_.=--In addition to the casual\\n\", 'traveler there began to visit the United States the thoughtful observer\\n', 'bent on finding out what manner of nation this was springing up in the\\n', 'wilderness. Those who looked with sympathy upon the growing popular\\n', 'forces of England and France found in the United States, in spite of\\n', \"many blemishes and defects, a guarantee for the future of the people's\\n\", 'rule in the Old World. One of these, Alexis de Tocqueville, a French\\n', 'liberal of mildly democratic sympathies, made a journey to this country\\n', 'in 1831; he described in a very remarkable volume, _Democracy in\\n', 'America_, the grand experiment as he saw it. On the whole he was\\n', 'convinced. After examining with a critical eye the life and labor of the\\n', 'American people, as well as the constitutions of the states and the\\n', 'nation, he came to the conclusion that democracy with all its faults was\\n', 'both inevitable and successful. Slavery he thought was a painful\\n', 'contrast to the other features of American life, and he foresaw what\\n', 'proved to be the irrepressible conflict over it. He believed that\\n', 'through blundering the people were destined to learn the highest of all\\n', 'arts, self-government on a grand scale. The absence of a leisure class,\\n', 'devoted to no calling or profession, merely enjoying the refinements of\\n', 'life and adding to its graces--the flaw in American culture that gave\\n', 'deep distress to many a European leader--de Tocqueville thought a\\n', 'necessary virtue in the republic. \"Amongst a democratic people where\\n', 'there is no hereditary wealth, every man works to earn a living, or has\\n', 'therefore presented to the mind on every side as the necessary, natural,\\n', 'and honest condition of human existence.\" It was this notion of a\\n', 'government in the hands of people who labored that struck the French\\n', 'publicist as the most significant fact in the modern world.\\n', '\\n', \"=Harriet Martineau's Visit to America.=--This phase of American life\\n\", 'also profoundly impressed the brilliant English writer, Harriet\\n', 'Martineau. She saw all parts of the country, the homes of the rich and\\n', 'the log cabins of the frontier; she traveled in stagecoaches, canal\\n', 'boats, and on horseback; and visited sessions of Congress and auctions\\n', 'at slave markets. She tried to view the country impartially and the\\n', 'thing that left the deepest mark on her mind was the solidarity of the\\n', 'people in one great political body. \"However various may be the tribes\\n', 'of inhabitants in those states, whatever part of the world may have been\\n', 'their birthplace, or that of their fathers, however broken may be their\\n', 'language, however servile or noble their employments, however exalted or\\n', 'despised their state, all are declared to be bound together by equal\\n', 'political obligations.... In that self-governing country all are held to\\n', 'have an equal interest in the principles of its institutions and to be\\n', 'bound in equal duty to watch their workings.\" Miss Martineau was also\\n', 'impressed with the passion of Americans for land ownership and\\n', 'contrasted the United States favorably with England where the tillers of\\n', 'the soil were either tenants or laborers for wages.\\n', '\\n', '=Adverse Criticism.=--By no means all observers and writers were\\n', 'convinced that America was a success. The fastidious traveler, Mrs.\\n', 'Trollope, who thought the English system of church and state was ideal,\\n', 'saw in the United States only roughness and ignorance. She lamented the\\n', '\"total and universal want of manners both in males and females,\" adding\\n', 'that while \"they appear to have clear heads and active intellects,\"\\n', 'there was \"no charm, no grace in their conversation.\" She found\\n', 'everywhere a lack of reverence for kings, learning, and rank. Other\\n', 'critics were even more savage. The editor of the _Foreign Quarterly_\\n', 'petulantly exclaimed that the United States was \"a brigand\\n', 'confederation.\" Charles Dickens declared the country to be \"so maimed\\n', 'and lame, so full of sores and ulcers that her best friends turn from\\n', 'the loathsome creature in disgust.\" Sydney Smith, editor of the\\n', '_Edinburgh Review_, was never tired of trying his caustic wit at the\\n', 'expense of America. \"Their Franklins and Washingtons and all the other\\n', 'sages and heroes of their revolution were born and bred subjects of the\\n', 'king of England,\" he observed in 1820. \"During the thirty or forty\\n', 'years of their independence they have done absolutely nothing for the\\n', 'sciences, for the arts, for literature, or even for the statesmanlike\\n', 'studies of politics or political economy.... In the four quarters of the\\n', 'globe who reads an American book? Or goes to an American play? Or looks\\n', 'at an American picture or statue?\" To put a sharp sting into his taunt\\n', 'he added, forgetting by whose authority slavery was introduced and\\n', 'fostered: \"Under which of the old tyrannical governments of Europe is\\n', 'every sixth man a slave whom his fellow creatures may buy and sell?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Some Americans, while resenting the hasty and often superficial\\n', 'judgments of European writers, winced under their satire and took\\n', 'thought about certain particulars in the indictments brought against\\n', 'them. The mass of the people, however, bent on the great experiment,\\n', 'gave little heed to carping critics who saw the flaws and not the\\n', 'achievements of our country--critics who were in fact less interested in\\n', 'America than in preventing the rise and growth of democracy in Europe.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Ostrogorski, _Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties_, Vol.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Questions=\\n', '\\n', '1.

When he made this astounding declaration, he doubtless had\\n', \"before his mind's eye the great stretches of unoccupied lands between\\n\", 'the Appalachians and the Mississippi. He also had before him the history\\n', 'of the English colonies, which told him of the two centuries required to\\n', 'settle the seaboard region. To practical men, his prophecy did not seem\\n', 'far wrong; but before the lapse of half that time there appeared beyond\\n', 'the Mississippi a tier of new states, reaching from the Gulf of Mexico\\n', 'to the southern boundary of Minnesota, and a new commonwealth on the\\n', 'Pacific Ocean where American emigrants had raised the Bear flag of\\n', 'California.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Missouri.=--When the middle of the nineteenth century had been reached,\\n', 'the Mississippi River, which Daniel Boone, the intrepid hunter, had\\n', 'crossed during Washington\\'s administration \"to escape from civilization\"\\n', 'in Kentucky, had become the waterway for a vast empire. The center of\\n', 'population of the United States had passed to the Ohio Valley. Missouri,\\n', 'with its wide reaches of rich lands, low-lying, level, and fertile, well\\n', 'adapted to hemp raising, had drawn to its borders thousands of planters\\n', 'from the old Southern states--from Virginia and the Carolinas as well as\\n', 'from Kentucky and Tennessee. When the great compromise of 1820-21\\n', 'admitted her to the union, wearing \"every jewel of sovereignty,\" as a\\n', 'florid orator announced, migratory slave owners were assured that their\\n', 'property would be safe in Missouri. Along the western shore of the\\n', 'Mississippi and on both banks of the Missouri to the uttermost limits of\\n', 'the state, plantations tilled by bondmen spread out in broad expanses.\\n', 'In the neighborhood of Jefferson City the slaves numbered more than a\\n', 'fourth of the population.\\n', '\\n', 'Into this stream of migration from the planting South flowed another\\n', 'current of land-tilling farmers; some from Kentucky, Tennessee, and\\n', 'Mississippi, driven out by the onrush of the planters buying and\\n', 'consolidating small farms into vast estates; and still more from the\\n', 'East and the Old World. To the northwest over against Iowa and to the\\n', 'southwest against Arkansas, these yeomen laid out farms to be tilled by\\n', 'their own labor. In those regions the number of slaves seldom rose above\\n', 'five or six per cent of the population. The old French post, St. Louis,\\n', 'enriched by the fur trade of the Far West and the steamboat traffic of\\n', 'the river, grew into a thriving commercial city, including among its\\n', 'seventy-five thousand inhabitants in 1850 nearly forty thousand\\n', 'foreigners, German immigrants from Pennsylvania and Europe being the\\n', 'largest single element.\\n', '\\n', '=Arkansas.=--Below Missouri lay the territory of Arkansas, which had\\n', 'long been the paradise of the swarthy hunter and the restless\\n', 'frontiersman fleeing from the advancing borders of farm and town. In\\n', 'search of the life, wild and free, where the rifle supplied the game and\\n', 'a few acres of ground the corn and potatoes, they had filtered into the\\n', 'territory in an unending drift, \"squatting\" on the land. Without so much\\n', 'as asking the leave of any government, territorial or national, they\\n', 'claimed as their own the soil on which they first planted their feet.\\n', 'Like the Cherokee Indians, whom they had as neighbors, whose very\\n', 'customs and dress they sometimes adopted, the squatters spent their days\\n', 'in the midst of rough plenty, beset by chills, fevers, and the ills of\\n', 'the flesh, but for many years unvexed by political troubles or the\\n', 'restrictions of civilized life.\\n', '\\n', 'Unfortunately for them, however, the fertile valleys of the Mississippi\\n', 'and Arkansas were well adapted to the cultivation of cotton and tobacco\\n', 'and their sylvan peace was soon broken by an invasion of planters. The\\n', 'newcomers, with their servile workers, spread upward in the valley\\n', 'toward Missouri and along the southern border westward to the Red River.\\n', 'In time the slaves in the tier of counties against Louisiana ranged from\\n', 'thirty to seventy per cent of the population. This marked the doom of\\n', 'the small farmer, swept Arkansas into the main current of planting\\n', 'politics, and led to a powerful lobby at Washington in favor of\\n', 'admission to the union, a boon granted in 1836.\\n', '\\n', '=Michigan.=--In accordance with a well-established custom, a free state\\n', 'was admitted to the union to balance a slave state. In 1833, the people\\n', 'of Michigan, a territory ten times the size of Connecticut, announced\\n', 'that the time had come for them to enjoy the privileges of a\\n', 'commonwealth. All along the southern border the land had been occupied\\n', 'largely by pioneers from New England, who built prim farmhouses and\\n', 'adopted the town-meeting plan of self-government after the fashion of\\n', 'the old home. The famous post of Detroit was growing into a flourishing\\n', 'city as the boats plying on the Great Lakes carried travelers, settlers,\\n', 'and freight through the narrows. In all, according to the census, there\\n', 'were more than ninety thousand inhabitants in the territory; so it was\\n', 'not without warrant that they clamored for statehood. Congress, busy as\\n', 'ever with politics, delayed; and the inhabitants of Michigan, unable to\\n', 'restrain their impatience, called a convention, drew up a constitution,\\n', 'and started a lively quarrel with Ohio over the southern boundary. The\\n', 'hand of Congress was now forced. Objections were made to the new\\n', 'constitution on the ground that it gave the ballot to all free white\\n', 'males, including aliens not yet naturalized; but the protests were\\n', 'overborne in a long debate. The boundary was fixed, and Michigan, though\\n', 'shorn of some of the land she claimed, came into the union in 1837.\\n', '\\n', '=Wisconsin.=--Across Lake Michigan to the west lay the territory of\\n', 'Wisconsin, which shared with Michigan the interesting history of the\\n', 'Northwest, running back into the heroic days when French hunters and\\n', 'missionaries were planning a French empire for the great monarch, Louis\\n', 'black-robed priests, prepared for sacrifice, even to death, the trappers\\n', 'of the French agencies, and the French explorers--Marquette, Joliet, and\\n', 'Menard--were the first white men to paddle their frail barks through the\\n', 'northern waters. They first blazed their trails into the black forests\\n', 'and left traces of their work in the names of portages and little\\n', 'villages. It was from these forests that Red Men in full war paint\\n', 'journeyed far to fight under the _fleur-de-lis_ of France when the\\n', 'soldiers of King Louis made their last stand at Quebec and Montreal\\n', 'against the imperial arms of Britain. It was here that the British flag\\n', 'was planted in 1761 and that the great Pontiac conspiracy was formed two\\n', 'years later to overthrow British dominion.\\n', '\\n', 'When, a generation afterward, the Stars and Stripes supplanted the Union\\n', 'Jack, the French were still almost the only white men in the region.\\n', 'They were soon joined by hustling Yankee fur traders who did battle\\n', 'royal against British interlopers. The traders cut their way through\\n', 'forest trails and laid out the routes through lake and stream and over\\n', 'portages for the settlers and their families from the states \"back\\n', 'East.\" It was the forest ranger who discovered the water power later\\n', 'used to turn the busy mills grinding the grain from the spreading farm\\n', 'lands. In the wake of the fur hunters, forest men, and farmers came\\n', 'miners from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri crowding in to exploit the\\n', 'lead ores of the northwest, some of them bringing slaves to work their\\n', 'claims. Had it not been for the gold fever of 1849 that drew the\\n', 'wielders of pick and shovel to the Far West, Wisconsin would early have\\n', 'taken high rank among the mining regions of the country.\\n', '\\n', 'From a favorable point of vantage on Lake Michigan, the village of\\n', 'Milwaukee, a center for lumber and grain transport and a place of entry\\n', 'for Eastern goods, grew into a thriving city. It claimed twenty thousand\\n', 'inhabitants, when in 1848 Congress admitted Wisconsin to the union.\\n', 'Already the Germans, Irish, and Scandinavians had found their way into\\n', 'the territory. They joined Americans from the older states in clearing\\n', 'forests, building roads, transforming trails into highways, erecting\\n', 'mills, and connecting streams with canals to make a network of routes\\n', 'for the traffic that poured to and from the Great Lakes.\\n', '\\n', '=Iowa and Minnesota.=--To the southwest of Wisconsin beyond the\\n', 'Mississippi, where the tall grass of the prairies waved like the sea,\\n', 'farmers from New England, New York, and Ohio had prepared Iowa for\\n', 'went northward; for freemen, unaccustomed to slavery and slave markets,\\n', 'preferred the open country above the compromise line. With incredible\\n', 'swiftness, they spread farms westward from the Mississippi. With Yankee\\n', 'ingenuity they turned to trading on the river, building before 1836\\n', 'three prosperous centers of traffic: Dubuque, Davenport, and Burlington.\\n', 'True to their old traditions, they founded colleges and academies that\\n', 'religion and learning might be cherished on the frontier as in the\\n', 'states from which they came. Prepared for self-government, the Iowans\\n', 'laid siege to the door of Congress and were admitted to the union in\\n', '1846.\\n', '\\n', 'Above Iowa, on the Mississippi, lay the territory of Minnesota--the home\\n', 'of the Dakotas, the Ojibways, and the Sioux. Like Michigan and\\n', 'Wisconsin, it had been explored early by the French scouts, and the\\n', 'first white settlement was the little French village of Mendota. To the\\n', 'people of the United States, the resources of the country were first\\n', 'revealed by the historic journey of Zebulon Pike in 1805 and by American\\n', 'fur traders who were quick to take advantage of the opportunity to ply\\n', 'their arts of hunting and bartering in fresh fields. In 1839 an\\n', 'American settlement was planted at Marina on the St. Croix, the outpost\\n', 'of advancing civilization. Within twenty years, the territory, boasting\\n', 'a population of 150,000, asked for admission to the union. In 1858 the\\n', 'plea was granted and Minnesota showed her gratitude three years later by\\n', 'being first among the states to offer troops to Lincoln in the hour of\\n', 'peril.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Uniformity of the Middle West.=--There was a certain monotony about\\n', 'pioneering in the Northwest and on the middle border. As the long\\n', 'stretches of land were cleared or prepared for the plow, they were laid\\n', 'out like checkerboards into squares of forty, eighty, one hundred sixty,\\n', 'or more acres, each the seat of a homestead. There was a striking\\n', 'uniformity also about the endless succession of fertile fields spreading\\n', 'far and wide under the hot summer sun. No majestic mountains relieved\\n', 'the sweep of the prairie. Few monuments of other races and antiquity\\n', 'were there to awaken curiosity about the region. No sonorous bells in\\n', 'old missions rang out the time of day. The chaffering Red Man bartering\\n', 'blankets and furs for powder and whisky had passed farther on. The\\n', 'population was made up of plain farmers and their families engaged in\\n', 'severe and unbroken labor, chopping down trees, draining fever-breeding\\n', 'swamps, breaking new ground, and planting from year to year the same\\n', 'rotation of crops. Nearly all the settlers were of native American stock\\n', 'into whose frugal and industrious lives the later Irish and German\\n', 'immigrants fitted, on the whole, with little friction. Even the Dutch\\n', 'oven fell before the cast-iron cooking stove. Happiness and sorrow,\\n', 'despair and hope were there, but all encompassed by the heavy tedium of\\n', 'prosaic sameness.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Daniel Boone had stirred the snug Americans of the seaboard to seek\\n', 'their fortunes beyond the Appalachians, so now Kit Carson, James Bowie,\\n', 'into a new land, only a part of which was under the American flag. The\\n', 'setting for this new scene in the westward movement was thrown out in a\\n', 'wide sweep from the headwaters of the Mississippi to the banks of the\\n', 'Rio Grande; from the valleys of the Sabine and Red rivers to Montana and\\n', 'the Pacific slope. In comparison with the middle border, this region\\n', 'presented such startling diversities that only the eye of faith could\\n', 'foresee the unifying power of nationalism binding its communities with\\n', 'the older sections of the country. What contrasts indeed! The blue grass\\n', 'region of Kentucky or the rich, black soil of Illinois--the painted\\n', 'desert, the home of the sage brush and the coyote! The level prairies of\\n', 'Iowa--the mighty Rockies shouldering themselves high against the\\n', 'horizon! The long bleak winters of Wisconsin--California of endless\\n', 'summer! The log churches of Indiana or Illinois--the quaint missions of\\n', 'San Antonio, Tucson, and Santa Barbara! The little state of\\n', 'Delaware--the empire of Texas, one hundred and twenty times its area!\\n', 'And scattered about through the Southwest were signs of an ancient\\n', 'civilization--fragments of four-and five-story dwellings, ruined dams,\\n', 'aqueducts, and broken canals, which told of once prosperous peoples\\n', 'who, by art and science, had conquered the aridity of the desert and\\n', 'lifted themselves in the scale of culture above the savages of the\\n', 'plain.\\n', '\\n', 'The settlers of this vast empire were to be as diverse in their origins\\n', 'and habits as those of the colonies on the coast had been. Americans of\\n', 'English, Irish, and Scotch-Irish descent came as usual from the Eastern\\n', 'states. To them were added the migratory Germans as well. Now for the\\n', 'first time came throngs of Scandinavians. Some were to make their homes\\n', 'on quiet farms as the border advanced against the setting sun. Others\\n', 'were to be Indian scouts, trappers, fur hunters, miners, cowboys, Texas\\n', 'planters, keepers of lonely posts on the plain and the desert, stage\\n', 'drivers, pilots of wagon trains, pony riders, fruit growers, \"lumber\\n', 'jacks,\" and smelter workers. One common bond united them--a passion for\\n', 'the self-government accorded to states. As soon as a few thousand\\n', 'settlers came together in a single territory, there arose a mighty shout\\n', 'for a position beside the staid commonwealths of the East and the South.\\n', 'Statehood meant to the pioneers self-government, dignity, and the right\\n', 'to dispose of land, minerals, and timber in their own way. In the quest\\n', 'for this local autonomy there arose many a wordy contest in Congress,\\n', 'each of the political parties lending a helping hand in the admission of\\n', 'a state when it gave promise of adding new congressmen of the \"right\\n', 'political persuasion,\" to use the current phrase.\\n', '\\n', '=Southern Planters and Texas.=--While the farmers of the North found the\\n', 'broad acres of the Western prairies stretching on before them apparently\\n', 'in endless expanse, it was far different with the Southern planters.\\n', 'Ever active in their search for new fields as they exhausted the virgin\\n', 'soil of the older states, the restless subjects of King Cotton quickly\\n', 'reached the frontier of Louisiana. There they paused; but only for a\\n', 'moment. The fertile land of Texas just across the boundary lured them on\\n', 'and the Mexican republic to which it belonged extended to them a more\\n', 'than generous welcome. Little realizing the perils lurking in a\\n', '\"peaceful penetration,\" the authorities at Mexico City opened wide the\\n', 'doors and made large grants of land to American contractors, who agreed\\n', 'to bring a number of families into Texas. The omnipresent Yankee, in the\\n', 'person of Moses Austin of Connecticut, hearing of this good news in the\\n', 'Southwest, obtained a grant in 1820 to settle three hundred Americans\\n', 'near Bexar--a commission finally carried out to the letter by his son\\n', 'and celebrated in the name given to the present capital of the state of\\n', 'Texas. Within a decade some twenty thousand Americans had crossed the\\n', 'border.\\n', '\\n', '=Mexico Closes the Door.=--The government of Mexico, unaccustomed to\\n', 'such enterprise and thoroughly frightened by its extent, drew back in\\n', 'dismay. Its fears were increased as quarrels broke out between the\\n', 'Americans and the natives in Texas. Fear grew into consternation when\\n', 'efforts were made by President Jackson to buy the territory for the\\n', 'United States. Mexico then sought to close the flood gates. It stopped\\n', 'all American colonization schemes, canceled many of the land grants, put\\n', 'a tariff on farming implements, and abolished slavery. These barriers\\n', 'the United States. The sentinels of the frontier answered. Davy\\n', 'Crockett, the noted frontiersman, bear hunter, and backwoods politician;\\n', 'James Bowie, the dexterous wielder of the knife that to this day bears\\n', 'his name; and Sam Houston, warrior and pioneer, rushed to the aid of\\n', 'their countrymen in Texas. Unacquainted with the niceties of diplomacy,\\n', 'impatient at the formalities of international law, they soon made it\\n', 'known that in spite of Mexican sovereignty they would be their own\\n', 'masters.\\n', '\\n', '=The Independence of Texas Declared.=--Numbering only about one-fourth\\n', 'of the population in Texas, they raised the standard of revolt in 1836\\n', 'and summoned a convention. Following in the footsteps of their\\n', 'ancestors, they issued a declaration of independence signed mainly by\\n', 'Americans from the slave states. Anticipating that the government of\\n', 'Mexico would not quietly accept their word of defiance as final, they\\n', 'dispatched a force to repel \"the invading army,\" as General Houston\\n', 'called the troops advancing under the command of Santa Ana, the Mexican\\n', 'Alamo, an old Spanish mission in the cottonwood trees in the town of San\\n', 'Antonio. Instead of obeying the order to blow up the mission and retire,\\n', 'they held their ground until they were completely surrounded and cut off\\n', 'from all help. Refusing to surrender, they fought to the bitter end, the\\n', 'last man falling a victim to the sword. Vengeance was swift. Within\\n', 'three months General Houston overwhelmed Santa Ana at the San Jacinto,\\n', 'taking him prisoner of war and putting an end to all hopes for the\\n', 'restoration of Mexican sovereignty over Texas.\\n', '\\n', 'The Lone Star Republic, with Houston at the head, then sought admission\\n', 'to the United States. This seemed at first an easy matter. All that was\\n', 'required to bring it about appeared to be a treaty annexing Texas to the\\n', 'union. Moreover, President Jackson, at the height of his popularity, had\\n', 'a warm regard for General Houston and, with his usual sympathy for rough\\n', 'and ready ways of doing things, approved the transaction. Through an\\n', 'American representative in Mexico, Jackson had long and anxiously\\n', 'labored, by means none too nice, to wring from the Mexican republic the\\n', 'cession of the coveted territory. When the Texans took matters into\\n', 'their own hands, he was more than pleased; but he could not marshal the\\n', 'approval of two-thirds of the Senators required for a treaty of\\n', 'annexation. Cautious as well as impetuous, Jackson did not press the\\n', 'issue; he went out of office in 1837 with Texas uncertain as to her\\n', 'future.\\n', '\\n', '=Northern Opposition to Annexation.=--All through the North the\\n', 'opposition to annexation was clear and strong. Anti-slavery agitators\\n', 'could hardly find words savage enough to express their feelings.\\n', '\"Texas,\" exclaimed Channing in a letter to Clay, \"is but the first step\\n', 'prepared to seize on a neighboring territory for the end of extending\\n', 'God, in the sight of nations, and adopt this atrocious policy? Sooner\\n', 'perish! Sooner be our name blotted out from the record of nations!\"\\n', 'William Lloyd Garrison called for the secession of the Northern states\\n', 'if Texas was brought into the union with slavery. John Quincy Adams\\n', 'warned his countrymen that they were treading in the path of the\\n', 'imperialism that had brought the nations of antiquity to judgment and\\n', 'destruction. Henry Clay, the Whig candidate for President, taking into\\n', 'account changing public sentiment, blew hot and cold, losing the state\\n', 'of New York and the election of 1844 by giving a qualified approval of\\n', 'annexation. In the same campaign, the Democrats boldly demanded the\\n', '\"Reannexation of Texas,\" based on claims which the United States once\\n', 'had to Spanish territory beyond the Sabine River.\\n', '\\n', '=Annexation.=--The politicians were disposed to walk very warily. Van\\n', 'Buren, at heart opposed to slavery extension, refused to press the issue\\n', 'of annexation. Tyler, a pro-slavery Democrat from Virginia, by a strange\\n', 'fling of fortune carried into office as a nominal Whig, kept his mind\\n', 'firmly fixed on the idea of reelection and let the troublesome matter\\n', 'rest until the end of his administration was in sight. He then listened\\n', 'with favor to the voice of the South. Calhoun stated what seemed to be a\\n', 'convincing argument: All good Americans have their hearts set on the\\n', 'Constitution; the admission of Texas is absolutely essential to the\\n', 'preservation of the union; it will give a balance of power to the South\\n', 'as against the North growing with incredible swiftness in wealth and\\n', 'population. Tyler, impressed by the plea, appointed Calhoun to the\\n', 'office of Secretary of State in 1844, authorizing him to negotiate the\\n', 'treaty of annexation--a commission at once executed. This scheme was\\n', 'blocked in the Senate where the necessary two-thirds vote could not be\\n', 'secured. Balked but not defeated, the advocates of annexation drew up a\\n', 'joint resolution which required only a majority vote in both houses,\\n', 'and in February of the next year, just before Tyler gave way to Polk,\\n', 'they pushed it through Congress. So Texas, amid the groans of Boston and\\n', 'the hurrahs of Charleston, folded up her flag and came into the union.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Mexican War.=--The inevitable war with Mexico, foretold by the\\n', 'abolitionists and feared by Henry Clay, ensued, the ostensible cause\\n', 'being a dispute over the boundaries of the new state. The Texans claimed\\n', 'all the lands down to the Rio Grande. The Mexicans placed the border of\\n', 'Texas at the Nueces River and a line drawn thence in a northerly\\n', 'direction. President Polk, accepting the Texan view of the controversy,\\n', 'ordered General Zachary Taylor to move beyond the Nueces in defense of\\n', 'American sovereignty. This act of power, deemed by the Mexicans an\\n', 'invasion of their territory, was followed by an attack on our troops.\\n', '\\n', 'President Polk, not displeased with the turn of events, announced that\\n', 'American blood had been \"spilled on American soil\" and that war existed\\n', '\"by the act of Mexico.\" Congress, in a burst of patriotic fervor,\\n', 'brushed aside the protests of those who deplored the conduct of the\\n', 'government as wanton aggression on a weaker nation and granted money and\\n', 'supplies to prosecute the war. The few Whigs in the House of\\n', 'Representatives, who refused to vote in favor of taking up arms,\\n', 'accepted the inevitable with such good grace as they could command. All\\n', 'through the South and the West the war was popular. New England\\n', 'grumbled, but gave loyal, if not enthusiastic, support to a conflict\\n', 'precipitated by policies not of its own choosing. Only a handful of firm\\n', 'objectors held out. James Russell Lowell, in his _Biglow Papers_, flung\\n', 'scorn and sarcasm to the bitter end.\\n', '\\n', '=The Outcome of the War.=--The foregone conclusion was soon reached.\\n', 'General Taylor might have delivered the fatal thrust from northern\\n', 'Mexico if politics had not intervened. Polk, anxious to avoid raising up\\n', 'another military hero for the Whigs to nominate for President, decided\\n', 'to divide the honors by sending General Scott to strike a blow at the\\n', 'capital, Mexico City. The deed was done with speed and pomp and two\\n', 'heroes were lifted into presidential possibilities. In the Far West a\\n', 'Commodores Sloat and Stockton and General Kearney, planted the Stars and\\n', 'Stripes on the Pacific slope.\\n', '\\n', 'In February, 1848, the Mexicans came to terms, ceding to the victor\\n', 'California, Arizona, New Mexico, and more--a domain greater in extent\\n', 'than the combined areas of France and Germany. As a salve to the wound,\\n', 'the vanquished received fifteen million dollars in cash and the\\n', 'cancellation of many claims held by American citizens. Five years later,\\n', 'through the negotiations of James Gadsden, a further cession of lands\\n', 'along the southern border of Arizona and New Mexico was secured on\\n', 'payment of ten million dollars.\\n', '\\n', '=General Taylor Elected President.=--The ink was hardly dry upon the\\n', 'treaty that closed the war before \"rough and ready\" General Taylor, a\\n', 'slave owner from Louisiana, \"a Whig,\" as he said, \"but not an ultra\\n', 'Whig,\" was put forward as the Whig candidate for President. He himself\\n', 'had not voted for years and he was fairly innocent in matters political.\\n', 'The tariff, the currency, and internal improvements, with a magnificent\\n', \"gesture he referred to the people's representatives in Congress,\\n\", \"offering to enforce the laws as made, if elected. Clay's followers\\n\", 'mourned. Polk stormed but could not win even a renomination at the hands\\n', 'of the Democrats. So it came about that the hero of Buena Vista,\\n', 'celebrated for his laconic order, \"Give \\'em a little more grape, Captain\\n', 'Bragg,\" became President of the United States.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Oregon.=--Closely associated in the popular mind with the contest about\\n', 'the affairs of Texas was a dispute with Great Britain over the\\n', 'possession of territory in Oregon. In their presidential campaign of\\n', '1844, the Democrats had coupled with the slogan, \"The Reannexation of\\n', 'Texas,\" two other cries, \"The Reoccupation of Oregon,\" and \"Fifty-four\\n', 'Forty or Fight.\" The last two slogans were founded on American\\n', 'discoveries and explorations in the Far Northwest. Their appearance in\\n', 'politics showed that the distant Oregon country, larger in area than New\\n', 'England, New York, and Pennsylvania combined, was at last receiving from\\n', 'the nation the attention which its importance warranted.\\n', '\\n', 'had long laid claim to Oregon and in 1818 they had agreed to occupy the\\n', 'territory jointly--a contract which was renewed ten years later for an\\n', 'indefinite period. Under this plan, citizens of both countries were free\\n', 'to hunt and settle anywhere in the region. The vanguard of British fur\\n', 'traders and Canadian priests was enlarged by many new recruits, with\\n', 'Americans not far behind them. John Jacob Astor, the resourceful New\\n', 'York merchant, sent out trappers and hunters who established a trading\\n', 'post at Astoria in 1811. Some twenty years later, American\\n', 'missionaries--among them two very remarkable men, Jason Lee and Marcus\\n', 'Whitman--were preaching the gospel to the Indians.\\n', '\\n', 'Through news from the fur traders and missionaries, Eastern farmers\\n', 'heard of the fertile lands awaiting their plows on the Pacific slope;\\n', 'those with the pioneering spirit made ready to take possession of the\\n', 'new country. In 1839 a band went around by Cape Horn. Four years later a\\n', 'great expedition went overland. The way once broken, others followed\\n', 'rapidly. As soon as a few settlements were well established, the\\n', 'pioneers held a mass meeting and agreed upon a plan of government. \"We,\\n', 'the people of Oregon territory,\" runs the preamble to their compact,\\n', '\"for the purposes of mutual protection and to secure peace and\\n', 'prosperity among ourselves, agree to adopt the following laws and\\n', 'regulations until such time as the United States of America extend their\\n', 'jurisdiction over us.\" Thus self-government made its way across the\\n', 'Rocky Mountains.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'evident that the boundaries of Oregon must be fixed. Having made the\\n', 'question an issue in his campaign, Polk, after his election in 1844,\\n', 'pressed it upon the attention of the country. In his inaugural address\\n', 'and his first message to Congress he reiterated the claim of the\\n', 'Democratic platform that \"our title to the whole territory of Oregon is\\n', 'clear and unquestionable.\" This pretension Great Britain firmly\\n', 'rejected, leaving the President a choice between war and compromise.\\n', '\\n', 'Polk, already having the contest with Mexico on his hands, sought and\\n', 'obtained a compromise. The British government, moved by a hint from the\\n', 'American minister, offered a settlement which would fix the boundary at\\n', 'the forty-ninth parallel instead of \"fifty-four forty,\" and give it\\n', 'Vancouver Island. Polk speedily chose this way out of the dilemma.\\n', 'Instead of making the decision himself, however, and drawing up a\\n', 'treaty, he turned to the Senate for \"counsel.\" As prearranged with party\\n', 'leaders, the advice was favorable to the plan. The treaty, duly drawn in\\n', '1846, was ratified by the Senate after an acrimonious debate. \"Oh!\\n', 'mountain that was delivered of a mouse,\" exclaimed Senator Benton, \"thy\\n', 'name shall be fifty-four forty!\" Thirteen years later, the southern part\\n', 'of the territory was admitted to the union as the state of Oregon,\\n', 'leaving the northern and eastern sections in the status of a territory.\\n', '\\n', '=California.=--With the growth of the northwestern empire, dedicated by\\n', 'nature to freedom, the planting interests might have been content, had\\n', 'fortune not wrested from them the fair country of California. Upon this\\n', 'huge territory they had set their hearts. The mild climate and fertile\\n', 'soil seemed well suited to slavery and the planters expected to extend\\n', 'their sway to the entire domain. California was a state of more than\\n', '155,000 square miles--about seventy times the size of the state of\\n', 'Delaware. It could readily be divided into five or six large states, if\\n', 'that became necessary to preserve the Southern balance of power.\\n', '\\n', 'were not on the side of the planters. Already Americans of a far\\n', 'different type were invading the Pacific slope. Long before Polk ever\\n', 'dreamed of California, the Yankee with his cargo of notions had been\\n', 'around the Horn. Daring skippers had sailed out of New England harbors\\n', 'with a variety of goods, bent their course around South America to\\n', 'California, on to China and around the world, trading as they went and\\n', 'leaving pots, pans, woolen cloth, guns, boots, shoes, salt fish, naval\\n', 'stores, and rum in their wake. \"Home from Californy!\" rang the cry in\\n', 'many a New England port as a good captain let go his anchor on his\\n', 'return from the long trading voyage in the Pacific.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'western scouts searched for overland routes to the Pacific. Zebulon\\n', 'Pike, explorer and pathfinder, by his expedition into the Southwest\\n', \"during Jefferson's administration, had discovered the resources of New\\n\", 'Spain and had shown his countrymen how easy it was to reach Santa Fe\\n', 'from the upper waters of the Arkansas River. Not long afterward, traders\\n', 'laid open the route, making Franklin, Missouri, and later Fort\\n', 'Leavenworth the starting point. Along the trail, once surveyed, poured\\n', 'caravans heavily guarded by armed men against marauding Indians. Sand\\n', 'storms often wiped out all signs of the route; hunger and thirst did\\n', 'many a band of wagoners to death; but the lure of the game and the\\n', 'profits at the end kept the business thriving. Huge stocks of cottons,\\n', 'glass, hardware, and ammunition were drawn almost across the continent\\n', 'to be exchanged at Santa Fe for furs, Indian blankets, silver, and\\n', 'mules; and many a fortune was made out of the traffic.\\n', '\\n', 'long remain unanswered. In 1829, Ewing Young broke the path to Los\\n', 'Angeles. Thirteen years later Fremont made the first of his celebrated\\n', 'expeditions across plain, desert, and mountain, arousing the interest of\\n', 'the entire country in the Far West. In the wake of the pathfinders went\\n', 'adventurers, settlers, and artisans. By 1847, more than one-fifth of the\\n', 'inhabitants in the little post of two thousand on San Francisco Bay were\\n', 'from the United States. The Mexican War, therefore, was not the\\n', 'beginning but the end of the American conquest of California--a conquest\\n', 'initiated by Americans who went to till the soil, to trade, or to follow\\n', 'some mechanical pursuit.\\n', '\\n', 'secured by the friends of free soil, there came in 1848 the sudden\\n', \"discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in the Sacramento Valley. When this\\n\", 'exciting news reached the East, a mighty rush began to California, over\\n', 'the trails, across the Isthmus of Panama, and around Cape Horn. Before\\n', 'two years had passed, it is estimated that a hundred thousand people, in\\n', 'search of fortunes, had arrived in California--mechanics, teachers,\\n', 'doctors, lawyers, farmers, miners, and laborers from the four corners of\\n', 'the earth.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'naturally resulted the usual demand for admission to the union. Instead\\n', 'of waiting for authority from Washington, the Californians held a\\n', 'convention in 1849 and framed their constitution. With impatience, the\\n', 'delegates brushed aside the plea that \"the balance of power between the\\n', 'North and South\" required the admission of their state as a slave\\n', 'commonwealth. Without a dissenting voice, they voted in favor of freedom\\n', 'and boldly made their request for inclusion among the United States.\\n', 'President Taylor, though a Southern man, advised Congress to admit the\\n', 'applicant. Robert Toombs of Georgia vowed to God that he preferred\\n', 'secession. Henry Clay, the great compromiser, came to the rescue and in\\n', '1850 California was admitted as a free state.\\n', '\\n', '=Utah.=--On the long road to California, in the midst of forbidding and\\n', 'barren wastes, a religious sect, the Mormons, had planted a colony\\n', 'destined to a stormy career. Founded in 1830 under the leadership of\\n', 'Joseph Smith of New York, the sect had suffered from many cruel buffets\\n', 'of fortune. From Ohio they had migrated into Missouri where they were\\n', 'set upon and beaten. Some of them were murdered by indignant neighbors.\\n', 'Harried out of Missouri, they went into Illinois only to see their\\n', 'director and prophet, Smith, first imprisoned by the authorities and\\n', 'then shot by a mob. Having raised up a cloud of enemies on account of\\n', 'both their religious faith and their practice of allowing a man to have\\n', 'more than one wife, they fell in heartily with the suggestion of a new\\n', 'leader, Brigham Young, that they go into the Far West beyond the plains\\n', 'of Kansas--into the forlorn desert where the wicked would cease from\\n', 'troubling and the weary could be at rest, as they read in the Bible. In\\n', '1847, Young, with a company of picked men, searched far and wide until\\n', 'he found a suitable spot overlooking the Salt Lake Valley. Returning to\\n', 'Illinois, he gathered up his followers, now numbering several thousand,\\n', 'and in one mighty wagon caravan they all went to their distant haven.\\n', '\\n', 'had a leader of remarkable power who gave direction to the redemption of\\n', 'the arid soil, the management of property, and the upbuilding of\\n', 'industry. He promised them to make the desert blossom as the rose, and\\n', 'verily he did it. He firmly shaped the enterprise of the colony along\\n', 'co-operative lines, holding down the speculator and profiteer with one\\n', 'hand and giving encouragement to the industrious poor with the other.\\n', 'With the shrewdness befitting a good business man, he knew how to draw\\n', 'the line between public and private interest. Land was given outright to\\n', 'each family, but great care was exercised in the distribution so that\\n', 'none should have great advantage over another. The purchase of supplies\\n', 'and the sale of produce were carried on through a cooperative store, the\\n', 'profits of which went to the common good. Encountering for the first\\n', 'time in the history of the Anglo-Saxon race the problem of aridity, the\\n', 'Mormons surmounted the most perplexing obstacles with astounding skill.\\n', 'They built irrigation works by cooperative labor and granted water\\n', 'rights to all families on equitable terms.\\n', '\\n', 'interest of the colony, the Mormons, eager to be self-supporting in\\n', 'every possible way, bent their efforts also to manufacturing and later\\n', 'to mining. Their missionaries, who hunted in the highways and byways of\\n', 'Europe for converts, never failed to stress the economic advantages of\\n', 'the sect. \"We want,\" proclaimed President Young to all the earth, \"a\\n', 'company of woolen manufacturers to come with machinery and take the wool\\n', 'from the sheep and convert it into the best clothes. We want a company\\n', 'of potters; we need them; the clay is ready and the dishes wanted.... We\\n', 'want some men to start a furnace forthwith; the iron, coal, and molders\\n', 'are waiting.... We have a printing press and any one who can take good\\n', 'printing and writing paper to the Valley will be a blessing to\\n', 'themselves and the church.\" Roads and bridges were built; millions were\\n', 'spent in experiments in agriculture and manufacturing; missionaries at a\\n', 'huge cost were maintained in the East and in Europe; an army was kept\\n', 'for defense against the Indians; and colonies were planted in the\\n', 'the Mormons, estimated in 1895 that by the labor of their hands the\\n', 'people had produced nearly half a billion dollars in wealth since the\\n', 'coming of the vanguard.\\n', '\\n', 'remain undisturbed by outsiders was soon dashed to earth, for hundreds\\n', 'of farmers and artisans belonging to other religious sects came to\\n', 'settle among them. In 1850 the colony was so populous and prosperous\\n', 'that it was organized into a territory of the United States and brought\\n', 'under the supervision of the federal government. Protests against\\n', 'polygamy were raised in the colony and at the seat of authority three\\n', 'thousand miles away at Washington. The new Republican party in 1856\\n', 'proclaimed it \"the right and duty of Congress to prohibit in the\\n', 'Territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery.\" In\\n', 'due time the Mormons had to give up their marriage practices which were\\n', 'condemned by the common opinion of all western civilization; but they\\n', 'kept their religious faith. Monuments to their early enterprise are seen\\n', 'in the Temple and the Tabernacle, the irrigation works, and the great\\n', 'wealth of the Church.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'While the statesmen of the old generation were solving the problems of\\n', 'their age, hunters, pioneers, and home seekers were preparing new\\n', 'problems beyond the Alleghanies. The West was rising in population and\\n', 'wealth. Between 1783 and 1829, eleven states were added to the original\\n', 'thirteen. All but two were in the West. Two of them were in the\\n', 'Louisiana territory beyond the Mississippi. Here the process of\\n', 'colonization was repeated. Hardy frontier people cut down the forests,\\n', 'built log cabins, laid out farms, and cut roads through the wilderness.\\n', 'They began a new civilization just as the immigrants to Virginia or\\n', 'Massachusetts had done two centuries earlier.\\n', '\\n', 'Like the seaboard colonists before them, they too cherished the spirit\\n', 'of independence and power. They had not gone far upon their course\\n', 'before they resented the monopoly of the presidency by the East. In 1829\\n', 'they actually sent one of their own cherished leaders, Andrew Jackson,\\n', 'to the White House. Again in 1840, in 1844, in 1848, and in 1860, the\\n', 'Mississippi Valley could boast that one of its sons had been chosen for\\n', 'the seat of power at Washington. Its democratic temper evoked a cordial\\n', 'response in the towns of the East where the old aristocracy had been put\\n', 'aside and artisans had been given the ballot.\\n', '\\n', 'For three decades the West occupied the interest of the nation. Under\\n', \"Jackson's leadership, it destroyed the second United States Bank. When\\n\", 'he smote nullification in South Carolina, it gave him cordial support.\\n', 'It approved his policy of parceling out government offices among party\\n', 'workers--\"the spoils system\" in all its fullness.

The old home of Jacksonian democracy, where\\n', 'Federalists had been almost as scarce as monarchists, turned slowly\\n', 'backward, as the needle to the pole, toward the principle of protection\\n', 'for domestic industry, espoused by Hamilton and defended by Clay.\\n', '\\n', '=The Extension of Canals and Railways.=--As necessary to mechanical\\n', 'industry as steel and steam power was the great market, spread over a\\n', 'wide and diversified area and knit together by efficient means of\\n', 'transportation. This service was supplied to industry by the steamship,\\n', 'which began its career on the Hudson in 1807; by the canals, of which\\n', 'the Erie opened in 1825 was the most noteworthy; and by the railways,\\n', 'which came into practical operation about 1830.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'With sure instinct the Eastern manufacturer reached out for the markets\\n', 'of the Northwest territory where free farmers were producing annually\\n', 'staggering crops of corn, wheat, bacon, and wool. The two great canal\\n', 'systems--the Erie connecting New York City with the waterways of the\\n', 'Great Lakes and the Pennsylvania chain linking Philadelphia with the\\n', 'headwaters of the Ohio--gradually turned the tide of trade from New\\n', 'Orleans to the Eastern seaboard. The railways followed the same paths.\\n', 'By 1860, New York had rail connections with Chicago and St. Louis, one\\n', 'of the routes running through the Hudson and Mohawk valleys and along\\n', 'the Great Lakes, the other through Philadelphia and Pennsylvania and\\n', 'across the rich wheat fields of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Baltimore,\\n', 'not to be outdone by her two rivals, reached out over the mountains for\\n', 'the Western trade and in 1857 had trains running into St. Louis.\\n', '\\n', 'In railway enterprise the South took more interest than in canals, and\\n', 'the friends of that section came to its aid. To offset the magnet\\n', 'drawing trade away from the Mississippi Valley, lines were built from\\n', 'the Gulf to Chicago, the Illinois Central part of the project being a\\n', 'monument to the zeal and industry of a Democrat, better known in\\n', 'cotton and tobacco to the North or to seaports was of common concern to\\n', 'planters and manufacturers. Accordingly lines were flung down along the\\n', 'Southern coast, linking Richmond, Charleston, and Savannah with the\\n', 'Northern markets. Other lines struck inland from the coast, giving a\\n', 'rail outlet to the sea for Raleigh, Columbia, Atlanta, Chattanooga,\\n', 'Nashville, and Montgomery. Nevertheless, in spite of this enterprise,\\n', 'the mileage of all the Southern states in 1860 did not equal that of\\n', 'Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois combined.\\n', '\\n', '=Banking and Finance.=--Out of commerce and manufactures and the\\n', 'construction and operation of railways came such an accumulation of\\n', 'capital in the Northern states as merchants of old never imagined. The\\n', 'banks of the four industrial states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New\\n', 'York, and Pennsylvania in 1860 had funds greater than the banks in all\\n', 'the other states combined. New York City had become the money market of\\n', 'America, the center to which industrial companies, railway promoters,\\n', 'farmers, and planters turned for capital to initiate and carry on their\\n', 'operations. The banks of Louisiana, South Carolina, Georgia, and\\n', 'Virginia, it is true, had capital far in excess of the banks of the\\n', 'Northwest; but still they were relatively small compared with the\\n', 'financial institutions of the East.\\n', '\\n', 'magnitude in industry, transport, and finance, overturning as it did the\\n', 'agrarian civilization of the old Northwest and reaching out to the very\\n', 'borders of the country, could not fail to bring in its train\\n', 'consequences of a striking character. Some were immediate and obvious.\\n', 'Others require a fullness of time not yet reached to reveal their\\n', 'complete significance. Outstanding among them was the growth of an\\n', 'industrial population, detached from the land, concentrated in cities,\\n', 'and, to use Jefferson\\'s phrase, dependent upon \"the caprices and\\n', 'casualties of trade\" for a livelihood. This was a result, as the great\\n', 'Virginian had foreseen, which flowed inevitably from public and private\\n', 'efforts to stimulate industry as against agriculture.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'It was estimated in 1860, on the basis of the census figures, that\\n', 'mechanical production gave employment to 1,100,000 men and 285,000\\n', 'women, making, if the average number of dependents upon them be\\n', 'reckoned, nearly six million people or about one-sixth of the population\\n', 'of the country sustained from manufactures. \"This,\" runs the official\\n', 'record, \"was exclusive of the number engaged in the production of many\\n', 'of the raw materials and of the food for manufacturers; in the\\n', 'distribution of their products, such as merchants, clerks, draymen,\\n', 'mariners, the employees of railroads, expresses, and steamboats; of\\n', 'capitalists, various artistic and professional classes, as well as\\n', 'carpenters, bricklayers, painters, and the members of other mechanical\\n', 'trades not classed as manufactures. It is safe to assume, then, that\\n', 'one-third of the whole population is supported, directly, or indirectly,\\n', 'by manufacturing industry.\" Taking, however, the number of persons\\n', 'directly supported by manufactures, namely about six millions, reveals\\n', 'the astounding fact that the white laboring population, divorced from\\n', 'the soil, already exceeded the number of slaves on Southern farms and\\n', 'plantations.\\n', '\\n', 'population is examined, the more surprising is the fact that such an\\n', 'immense body of free laborers could be found, particularly when it is\\n', 'recalled to what desperate straits the colonial leaders were put in\\n', 'securing immigrants,--slavery, indentured servitude, and kidnapping\\n', 'being the fruits of their necessities. The answer to the enigma is to be\\n', 'found partly in European conditions and partly in the cheapness of\\n', 'transportation after the opening of the era of steam navigation. Shrewd\\n', 'observers of the course of events had long foreseen that a flood of\\n', 'cheap labor was bound to come when the way was made easy. Some, among\\n', 'them Chief Justice Ellsworth, went so far as to prophesy that white\\n', 'labor would in time be so abundant that slavery would disappear as the\\n', 'more costly of the two labor systems. The processes of nature were aided\\n', 'by the policies of government in England and Germany.\\n', '\\n', 'English government, ever furious and irrepressible, was increased in the\\n', 'mid forties by an almost total failure of the potato crop, the main\\n', 'support of the peasants. Catholic in religion, they had been compelled\\n', 'to support a Protestant church. Tillers of the soil by necessity, they\\n', 'were forced to pay enormous tributes to absentee landlords in England\\n', 'whose claim to their estates rested upon the title of conquest and\\n', 'confiscation. Intensely loyal to their race, the Irish were subjected in\\n', 'all things to the Parliament at London, in which their small minority of\\n', 'representatives had little influence save in holding a balance of power\\n', 'between the two contending English parties. To the constant political\\n', 'irritation, the potato famine added physical distress beyond\\n', 'description. In cottages and fields and along the highways the victims\\n', 'of starvation lay dead by the hundreds, the relief which charity\\n', 'afforded only bringing misery more sharply to the foreground. Those who\\n', 'were fortunate enough to secure passage money sought escape to America.\\n', 'In 1844 the total immigration into the United States was less than\\n', 'eighty thousand; in 1850 it had risen by leaps and bounds to more than\\n', 'three hundred thousand. Between 1820 and 1860 the immigrants from the\\n', 'United Kingdom numbered 2,750,000, of whom more than one-half were\\n', 'Irish. It has been said with a touch of exaggeration that the American\\n', 'canals and railways of those days were built by the labor of Irishmen.\\n', '\\n', 'such as was responsible for the coming of the Irish, may likewise be\\n', 'traced the source of the Germanic migration. The potato blight that fell\\n', 'upon Ireland visited the Rhine Valley and Southern Germany at the same\\n', 'time with results as pitiful, if less extensive. The calamity inflicted\\n', 'by nature was followed shortly by another inflicted by the despotic\\n', 'conduct of German kings and princes. In 1848 there had occurred\\n', 'throughout Europe a popular uprising in behalf of republics and\\n', 'democratic government. For a time it rode on a full tide of success.\\n', 'Kings were overthrown, or compelled to promise constitutional\\n', 'government, and tyrannical ministers fled from their palaces. Then came\\n', 'reaction. Those who had championed the popular cause were imprisoned,\\n', 'shot, or driven out of the land. Men of attainments and distinction,\\n', 'whose sole offense was opposition to the government of kings and\\n', 'princes, sought an asylum in America, carrying with them to the land of\\n', 'their adoption the spirit of liberty and democracy. In 1847 over fifty\\n', 'thousand Germans came to America, the forerunners of a migration that\\n', 'increased, almost steadily, for many years. The record of 1860 showed\\n', 'that in the previous twenty years nearly a million and a half had found\\n', 'homes in the United States. Far and wide they scattered, from the mills\\n', 'and shops of the seacoast towns to the uttermost frontiers of Wisconsin\\n', 'and Minnesota.\\n', '\\n', 'railways of the country were largely manned by foreign labor, still\\n', 'important native sources must not be overlooked; above all, the women\\n', 'and children of the New England textile districts. Spinning and weaving,\\n', 'by a tradition that runs far beyond the written records of mankind,\\n', 'belonged to women. Indeed it was the dexterous housewives, spinsters,\\n', 'and boys and girls that laid the foundations of the textile industry in\\n', 'America, foundations upon which the mechanical revolution was built. As\\n', 'the wheel and loom were taken out of the homes to the factories operated\\n', \"by water power or the steam engine, the women and, to use Hamilton's\\n\", 'phrase, \"the children of tender years,\" followed as a matter of course.\\n', '\"The cotton manufacture alone employs six thousand persons in Lowell,\"\\n', 'wrote a French observer in 1836; \"of this number nearly five thousand\\n', 'are young women from seventeen to twenty-four years of age, the\\n', 'daughters of farmers from the different New England states.\" It was not\\n', 'until after the middle of the century that foreign lands proved to be\\n', 'the chief source from which workers were recruited for the factories of\\n', 'New England. It was then that the daughters of the Puritans, outdone by\\n', 'the competition of foreign labor, both of men and women, left the\\n', 'spinning jenny and the loom to other hands.\\n', '\\n', '=The Rise of Organized Labor.=--The changing conditions of American\\n', 'life, marked by the spreading mill towns of New England, New York, and\\n', 'Pennsylvania and the growth of cities like Buffalo, Cincinnati,\\n', 'Louisville, St. Louis, Detroit, and Chicago in the West, naturally\\n', 'few mechanics, smiths, carpenters, and masons, widely scattered through\\n', 'farming regions and rural villages, raise no such problems as tens of\\n', 'thousands of workers collected in one center in daily intercourse,\\n', 'learning the power of cooperation and union.\\n', '\\n', 'Even before the coming of steam and machinery, in the \"good old days\" of\\n', 'handicrafts, laborers in many trades--printers, shoemakers, carpenters,\\n', 'for example--had begun to draw together in the towns for the advancement\\n', 'of their interests in the form of higher wages, shorter days, and\\n', 'milder laws. The shoemakers of Philadelphia, organized in 1794,\\n', 'conducted a strike in 1799 and held together until indicted seven years\\n', 'later for conspiracy. During the twenties and thirties, local labor\\n', 'unions sprang up in all industrial centers and they led almost\\n', 'immediately to city federations of the several crafts.\\n', '\\n', 'As the thousands who were dependent upon their daily labor for their\\n', 'livelihood mounted into the millions and industries spread across the\\n', 'continent, the local unions of craftsmen grew into national craft\\n', 'organizations bound together by the newspapers, the telegraph, and the\\n', 'railways. Before 1860 there were several such national trade unions,\\n', 'including the plumbers, printers, mule spinners, iron molders, and stone\\n', 'cutters. All over the North labor leaders arose--men unknown to general\\n', 'history but forceful and resourceful characters who forged links binding\\n', 'scattered and individual workers into a common brotherhood. An attempt\\n', 'was even made in 1834 to federate all the crafts into a permanent\\n', 'national organization; but it perished within three years through lack\\n', 'of support. Half a century had to elapse before the American Federation\\n', 'of Labor was to accomplish this task.\\n', '\\n', 'All the manifestations of the modern labor movement had appeared, in\\n', 'germ at least, by the time the mid-century was reached: unions, labor\\n', 'leaders, strikes, a labor press, a labor political program, and a labor\\n', 'political party. In every great city industrial disputes were a common\\n', 'occurrence. The papers recorded about four hundred in two years,\\n', '1853-54, local affairs but forecasting economic struggles in a larger\\n', 'field. The labor press seems to have begun with the founding of the\\n', \"_Mechanics' Free Press_ in Philadelphia in 1828 and the establishment of\\n\", \"the New York _Workingman's Advocate_ shortly afterward. These\\n\", 'semi-political papers were in later years followed by regular trade\\n', 'papers designed to weld together and advance the interests of particular\\n', 'crafts. Edited by able leaders, these little sheets with limited\\n', 'circulation wielded an enormous influence in the ranks of the workers.\\n', '\\n', '=Labor and Politics.=--As for the political program of labor, the main\\n', 'planks were clear and specific: the abolition of imprisonment for debt,\\n', 'manhood suffrage in states where property qualifications still\\n', 'prevailed, free and universal education, laws protecting the safety and\\n', 'health of workers in mills and factories, abolition of lotteries, repeal\\n', 'of laws requiring militia service, and free land in the West.\\n', '\\n', 'Into the labor papers and platforms there sometimes crept a note of\\n', 'hostility to the masters of industry, a sign of bitterness that excited\\n', 'little alarm while cheap land in the West was open to the discontented.\\n', 'The Philadelphia workmen, in issuing a call for a local convention,\\n', 'invited \"all those of our fellow citizens who live by their own labor\\n', 'and none other.\" In Newcastle county, Delaware, the association of\\n', 'working people complained in 1830: \"The poor have no laws; the laws are\\n', 'made by the rich and of course for the rich.\" Here and there an\\n', 'extremist went to the length of advocating an equal division of wealth\\n', 'among all the people--the crudest kind of communism.\\n', '\\n', 'Agitation of this character produced in labor circles profound distrust\\n', 'of both Whigs and Democrats who talked principally about tariffs and\\n', 'banks; it resulted in attempts to found independent labor parties. In\\n', 'Philadelphia, Albany, New York City, and New England, labor candidates\\n', 'were put up for elections in the early thirties and in a few cases were\\n', 'victorious at the polls. \"The balance of power has at length got into\\n', 'the hands of the working people, where it properly belongs,\"\\n', \"triumphantly exclaimed the _Mechanics' Free Press_ of Philadelphia in\\n\", '1829. But the triumph was illusory. Dissensions appeared in the labor\\n', 'ranks. The old party leaders, particularly of Tammany Hall, the\\n', 'Democratic party organization in New York City, offered concessions to\\n', 'labor in return for votes. Newspapers unsparingly denounced \"trade union\\n', 'politicians\" as \"demagogues,\" \"levellers,\" and \"rag, tag, and bobtail\";\\n', 'and some of them, deeming labor unrest the sour fruit of manhood\\n', 'suffrage, suggested disfranchisement as a remedy. Under the influence\\n', 'of concessions and attacks the political fever quickly died away, and\\n', 'the end of the decade left no remnant of the labor political parties.\\n', 'Labor leaders turned to a task which seemed more substantial and\\n', 'practical, that of organizing workingmen into craft unions for the\\n', 'definite purpose of raising wages and reducing hours.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Southern Plans for Union with the West.=--It was long the design of\\n', 'Southern statesmen like Calhoun to hold the West and the South together\\n', 'in one political party. The theory on which they based their hope was\\n', 'simple. Both sections were agricultural--the producers of raw materials\\n', 'and the buyers of manufactured goods. The planters were heavy purchasers\\n', 'of Western bacon, pork, mules, and grain. The Mississippi River and its\\n', 'tributaries formed the natural channel for the transportation of heavy\\n', 'produce southward to the plantations and outward to Europe. Therefore,\\n', 'ran their political reasoning, the interests of the two sections were\\n', 'one. By standing together in favor of low tariffs, they could buy their\\n', 'manufactures cheaply in Europe and pay for them in cotton, tobacco, and\\n', \"grain. The union of the two sections under Jackson's management seemed\\n\", 'perfect.\\n', '\\n', '=The East Forms Ties with the West.=--Eastern leaders were not blind to\\n', 'the ambitions of Southern statesmen. On the contrary, they also\\n', 'recognized the importance of forming strong ties with the agrarian West\\n', 'and drawing the produce of the Ohio Valley to Philadelphia and New York.\\n', 'The canals and railways were the physical signs of this economic union,\\n', 'and the results, commercial and political, were soon evident. By the\\n', 'middle of the century, Southern economists noted the change, one of\\n', 'them, De Bow, lamenting that \"the great cities of the North have\\n', 'severally penetrated the interior with artificial lines until they have\\n', 'taken from the open and untaxed current of the Mississippi the commerce\\n', 'produced on its borders.\" To this writer it was an astounding thing to\\n', 'behold \"the number of steamers that now descend the upper Mississippi\\n', 'River, loaded to the guards with produce, as far as the mouth of the\\n', 'Illinois River and then turn up that stream with their cargoes to be\\n', 'shipped to New York _via_ Chicago. The Illinois canal has not only swept\\n', 'the whole produce along the line of the Illinois River to the East, but\\n', 'it is drawing the products of the upper Mississippi through the same\\n', 'channel; thus depriving New Orleans and St. Louis of a rich portion of\\n', 'their former trade.\"\\n', '\\n', 'If to any shippers the broad current of the great river sweeping down to\\n', 'New Orleans offered easier means of physical communication to the sea\\n', 'than the canals and railways, the difference could be overcome by the\\n', 'credit which Eastern bankers were able to extend to the grain and\\n', 'produce buyers, in the first instance, and through them to the farmers\\n', 'on the soil. The acute Southern observer just quoted, De Bow, admitted\\n', 'with evident regret, in 1852, that \"last autumn, the rich regions of\\n', 'Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were flooded with the local bank notes of\\n', 'the Eastern States, advanced by the New York houses on produce to be\\n', 'shipped by way of the canals in the spring.... These moneyed facilities\\n', 'enable the packer, miller, and speculator to hold on to their produce\\n', 'until the opening of navigation in the spring and they are no longer\\n', 'obliged, as formerly, to hurry off their shipments during the winter by\\n', 'the way of New Orleans in order to realize funds by drafts on their\\n', 'shipments. The banking facilities at the East are doing as much to draw\\n', 'trade from us as the canals and railways which Eastern capital is\\n', 'constructing.\" Thus canals, railways, and financial credit were swiftly\\n', 'forging bonds of union between the old home of Jacksonian Democracy in\\n', 'the West and the older home of Federalism in the East. The nationalism\\n', 'to which Webster paid eloquent tribute became more and more real with\\n', 'the passing of time. The self-sufficiency of the pioneer was broken down\\n', 'as he began to watch the produce markets of New York and Philadelphia\\n', 'where the prices of corn and hogs fixed his earnings for the year.\\n', '\\n', '=The West and Manufactures.=--In addition to the commercial bonds\\n', 'between the East and the West there was growing up a common interest in\\n', 'manufactures. As skilled white labor increased in the Ohio Valley, the\\n', 'industries springing up in the new cities made Western life more like\\n', 'that of the industrial East than like that of the planting South.\\n', 'Moreover, the Western states produced some important raw materials for\\n', 'American factories, which called for protection against foreign\\n', 'competition, notably, wool, hemp, and flax. As the South had little or\\n', 'no foreign competition in cotton and tobacco, the East could not offer\\n', 'protection for her raw materials in exchange for protection for\\n', 'industries. With the West, however, it became possible to establish\\n', 'reciprocity in tariffs; that is, for example, to trade a high rate on\\n', 'wool for a high rate on textiles or iron.\\n', '\\n', '=The South Dependent on the North.=--While East and West were drawing\\n', 'together, the distinctions between North and South were becoming more\\n', 'marked; the latter, having few industries and producing little save raw\\n', 'materials, was being forced into the position of a dependent section. As\\n', 'a result of the protective tariff, Southern planters were compelled to\\n', 'turn more and more to Northern mills for their cloth, shoes, hats, hoes,\\n', 'plows, and machinery. Nearly all the goods which they bought in Europe\\n', 'in exchange for their produce came overseas to Northern ports, whence\\n', 'transshipments were made by rail and water to Southern points of\\n', 'distribution. Their rice, cotton, and tobacco, in as far as they were\\n', 'not carried to Europe in British bottoms, were transported by Northern\\n', 'masters. In these ways, a large part of the financial operations\\n', 'connected with the sale of Southern produce and the purchase of goods in\\n', 'exchange passed into the hands of Northern merchants and bankers who,\\n', 'naturally, made profits from their transactions. Finally, Southern\\n', 'planters who wanted to buy more land and more slaves on credit borrowed\\n', 'heavily in the North where huge accumulations made the rates of interest\\n', 'lower than the smaller banks of the South could afford.\\n', '\\n', '=The South Reckons the Cost of Economic Dependence.=--As Southern\\n', 'dependence upon Northern capital became more and more marked, Southern\\n', 'leaders began to chafe at what they regarded as restraints laid upon\\n', 'their enterprise. In a word, they came to look upon the planter as a\\n', 'tribute-bearer to the manufacturer and financier. \"The South,\"\\n', 'expostulated De Bow, \"stands in the attitude of feeding ... a vast\\n', 'population of [Northern] merchants, shipowners, capitalists, and others\\n', 'who, without claims on her progeny, drink up the life blood of her\\n', 'trade.... Where goes the value of our labor but to those who, taking\\n', 'advantage of our folly, ship for us, buy for us, sell to us, and, after\\n', 'turning our own capital to their profitable account, return laden with\\n', 'our money to enjoy their easily earned opulence at home.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Southern statisticians, not satisfied with generalities, attempted to\\n', 'figure out how great was this tribute in dollars and cents. They\\n', 'estimated that the planters annually lent to Northern merchants the full\\n', 'value of their exports, a hundred millions or more, \"to be used in the\\n', 'manipulation of foreign imports.\" They calculated that no less than\\n', 'forty millions all told had been paid to shipowners in profits. They\\n', 'reckoned that, if the South were to work up her own cotton, she would\\n', 'realize from seventy to one hundred millions a year that otherwise went\\n', 'North. Finally, to cap the climax, they regretted that planters spent\\n', 'some fifteen millions a year pleasure-seeking in the alluring cities and\\n', 'summer resorts of the North.\\n', '\\n', '=Southern Opposition to Northern Policies.=--Proceeding from these\\n', 'premises, Southern leaders drew the logical conclusion that the entire\\n', 'program of economic measures demanded in the North was without exception\\n', 'adverse to Southern interests and, by a similar chain of reasoning,\\n', 'injurious to the corn and wheat producers of the West. Cheap labor\\n', 'afforded by free immigration, a protective tariff raising prices of\\n', 'manufactures for the tiller of the soil, ship subsidies increasing the\\n', 'tonnage of carrying trade in Northern hands, internal improvements\\n', 'forging new economic bonds between the East and the West, a national\\n', 'banking system giving strict national control over the currency as a\\n', 'safeguard against paper inflation--all these devices were regarded in\\n', 'the South as contrary to the planting interest. They were constantly\\n', 'compared with the restrictive measures by which Great Britain more than\\n', 'half a century before had sought to bind American interests.\\n', '\\n', 'As oppression justified a war for independence once, statesmen argued,\\n', 'so it can justify it again. \"It is curious as it is melancholy and\\n', 'distressing,\" came a broad hint from South Carolina, \"to see how\\n', 'striking is the analogy between the colonial vassalage to which the\\n', 'manufacturing states have reduced the planting states and that which\\n', 'formerly bound the Anglo-American colonies to the British empire....\\n', \"England said to her American colonies: 'You shall not trade with the\\n\", 'rest of the world for such manufactures as are produced in the mother\\n', \"country.' The manufacturing states say to their Southern colonies: 'You\\n\", 'shall not trade with the rest of the world for such manufactures as we\\n', 'produce.\\'\" The conclusion was inexorable: either the South must control\\n', 'the national government and its economic measures, or it must declare,\\n', 'as America had done four score years before, its political and economic\\n', 'independence. As Northern mills multiplied, as railways spun their\\n', 'mighty web over the face of the North, and as accumulated capital rose\\n', 'into the hundreds of millions, the conviction of the planters and their\\n', 'statesmen deepened into desperation.\\n', '\\n', 'predominance of the North, made determined efforts to introduce\\n', 'manufactures into the South. To the leaders who were averse to secession\\n', 'and nullification this seemed the only remedy for the growing disparity\\n', 'in the power of the two sections. Societies for the encouragement of\\n', 'mechanical industries were formed, the investment of capital was sought,\\n', 'and indeed a few mills were built on Southern soil. The results were\\n', 'meager. The natural resources, coal and water power, were abundant; but\\n', 'the enterprise for direction and the skilled labor were wanting. The\\n', 'stream of European immigration flowed North and West, not South. The\\n', 'Irish or German laborer, even if he finally made his home in a city, had\\n', 'before him, while in the North, the alternative of a homestead on\\n', 'Western land. To him slavery was a strange, if not a repelling,\\n', 'institution. He did not take to it kindly nor care to fix his home where\\n', 'it flourished. While slavery lasted, the economy of the South was\\n', 'inevitably agricultural. While agriculture predominated, leadership with\\n', 'equal necessity fell to the planting interest. While the planting\\n', 'interest ruled, political opposition to Northern economy was destined to\\n', 'grow in strength.\\n', '\\n', '=The Southern Theory of Sectionalism.=--In the opinion of the statesmen\\n', 'who frankly represented the planting interest, the industrial system was\\n', 'its deadly enemy. Their entire philosophy of American politics was\\n', 'summed up in a single paragraph by McDuffie, a spokesman for South\\n', 'Carolina: \"Owing to the federative character of our government, the\\n', 'great geographical extent of our territory, and the diversity of the\\n', 'pursuits of our citizens in different parts of the union, it has so\\n', 'happened that two great interests have sprung up, standing directly\\n', 'opposed to each other. One of these consists of those manufactures which\\n', 'the Northern and Middle states are capable of producing but which, owing\\n', 'to the high price of labor and the high profits of capital in those\\n', 'states, cannot hold competition with foreign manufactures without the\\n', 'aid of bounties, directly or indirectly given, either by the general\\n', 'government or by the state governments. The other of these interests\\n', 'consists of the great agricultural staples of the Southern states which\\n', 'can find a market only in foreign countries and which can be\\n', 'advantageously sold only in exchange for foreign manufactures which come\\n', 'in competition with those of the Northern and Middle states.... These\\n', 'interests then stand diametrically and irreconcilably opposed to each\\n', 'other. The interest, the pecuniary interest of the Northern\\n', 'manufacturer, is directly promoted by every increase of the taxes\\n', 'imposed upon Southern commerce; and it is unnecessary to add that the\\n', 'interest of the Southern planter is promoted by every diminution of\\n', 'taxes imposed upon the productions of their industry. If, under these\\n', 'circumstances, the manufacturers were clothed with the power of imposing\\n', 'taxes, at their pleasure, upon the foreign imports of the planter, no\\n', 'doubt would exist in the mind of any man that it would have all the\\n', 'characteristics of an absolute and unqualified despotism.\" The economic\\n', 'soundness of this reasoning, a subject of interesting speculation for\\n', 'the economist, is of little concern to the historian. The historical\\n', 'point is that this opinion was widely held in the South and with the\\n', 'progress of time became the prevailing doctrine of the planting\\n', 'statesmen.\\n', '\\n', 'Their antagonism was deepened because they also became convinced, on\\n', 'what grounds it is not necessary to inquire, that the leaders of the\\n', 'industrial interest thus opposed to planting formed a consolidated\\n', '\"aristocracy of wealth,\" bent upon the pursuit and attainment of\\n', 'political power at Washington. \"By the aid of various associated\\n', 'interests,\" continued McDuffie, \"the manufacturing capitalists have\\n', 'obtained a complete and permanent control over the legislation of\\n', 'Congress on this subject [the tariff].... Men confederated together upon\\n', 'selfish and interested principles, whether in pursuit of the offices or\\n', 'the bounties of the government, are ever more active and vigilant than\\n', 'the great majority who act from disinterested and patriotic impulses.\\n', 'Have we not witnessed it on this floor, sir? Who ever knew the tariff\\n', 'men to divide on any question affecting their confederated interests?...\\n', 'The watchword is, stick together, right or wrong upon every question\\n', 'affecting the common cause. Such, sir, is the concert and vigilance and\\n', 'such the combinations by which the manufacturing party, acting upon the\\n', 'interests of some and the prejudices of others, have obtained a decided\\n', 'and permanent control over public opinion in all the tariff states.\"\\n', 'Thus, as the Southern statesman would have it, the North, in matters\\n', 'affecting national policies, was ruled by a \"confederated interest\"\\n', 'which menaced the planting interest.

From\\n', 'the inauguration of Washington to the election of Lincoln the sectional\\n', 'conflict, discerned by this penetrating thinker, exercised a profound\\n', 'influence on the course of American politics. It was latent during the\\n', '\"era of good feeling\" when the Jeffersonian Republicans adopted\\n', 'Federalist policies; it flamed up in the contest between the Democrats\\n', 'and Whigs. Finally it raged in the angry political quarrel which\\n', 'culminated in the Civil War.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Decline of Slavery in the North.=--At the time of the adoption of\\n', 'the Constitution, slavery was lawful in all the Northern states except\\n', 'Massachusetts. There were almost as many bondmen in New York as in\\n', 'Georgia. New Jersey had more than Delaware or Tennessee, indeed nearly\\n', 'as many as both combined. All told, however, there were only about forty\\n', 'thousand in the North as against nearly seven hundred thousand in the\\n', 'South. Moreover, most of the Northern slaves were domestic servants, not\\n', 'laborers necessary to keep mills going or fields under cultivation.\\n', '\\n', 'There was, in the North, a steadily growing moral sentiment against the\\n', 'system. Massachusetts abandoned it in 1780. In the same year,\\n', 'Pennsylvania provided for gradual emancipation. New Hampshire, where\\n', 'there had been only a handful, Connecticut with a few thousand\\n', 'domestics, and New Jersey early followed these examples. New York, in\\n', '1799, declared that all children born of slaves after July 4 of that\\n', 'year should be free, though held for a term as apprentices; and in 1827\\n', 'it swept away the last vestiges of slavery. So with the passing of the\\n', 'generation that had framed the Constitution, chattel servitude\\n', 'disappeared in the commercial states, leaving behind only such\\n', 'discriminations as disfranchisement or high property qualifications on\\n', 'colored voters.\\n', '\\n', '=The Growth of Northern Sentiment against Slavery.=--In both sections of\\n', 'the country there early existed, among those more or less\\n', 'philosophically inclined, a strong opposition to slavery on moral as\\n', 'well as economic grounds. In the constitutional convention of 1787,\\n', 'Gouverneur Morris had vigorously condemned it and proposed that the\\n', 'whole country should bear the cost of abolishing it. About the same time\\n', 'a society for promoting the abolition of slavery, under the presidency\\n', 'of Benjamin Franklin, laid before Congress a petition that serious\\n', 'attention be given to the emancipation of \"those unhappy men who alone\\n', 'in this land of freedom are degraded into perpetual bondage.\" When\\n', 'Congress, acting on the recommendations of President Jefferson, provided\\n', 'for the abolition of the foreign slave trade on January 1, 1808, several\\n', 'Northern members joined with Southern members in condemning the system\\n', 'as well as the trade. Later, colonization societies were formed to\\n', 'encourage the emancipation of slaves and their return to Africa. James\\n', 'Madison was president and Henry Clay vice president of such an\\n', 'organization.\\n', '\\n', 'The anti-slavery sentiment of which these were the signs was\\n', 'nevertheless confined to narrow circles and bore no trace of bitterness.\\n', '\\n', '\"We consider slavery your calamity, not your crime,\" wrote a\\n', 'distinguished Boston clergyman to his Southern brethren, \"and we will\\n', 'share with you the burden of putting an end to it. We will consent that\\n', 'everything which sows discord and exasperating sectional animosities.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Uncompromising Abolition.=--In a little while the spirit of generosity\\n', 'was gone. Just as Jacksonian Democracy rose to power there appeared a\\n', 'new kind of anti-slavery doctrine--the dogmatism of the abolition\\n', 'agitator. For mild speculation on the evils of the system was\\n', 'substituted an imperious and belligerent demand for instant\\n', 'emancipation. If a date must be fixed for its appearance, the year 1831\\n', 'may be taken when William Lloyd Garrison founded in Boston his\\n', 'anti-slavery paper, _The Liberator_. With singleness of purpose and\\n', 'utter contempt for all opposing opinions and arguments, he pursued his\\n', 'course of passionate denunciation. He apologized for having ever\\n', '\"assented to the popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition.\"\\n', 'He chose for his motto: \"Immediate and unconditional emancipation!\" He\\n', 'promised his readers that he would be \"harsh as truth and uncompromising\\n', 'as justice\"; that he would not \"think or speak or write with\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Though Garrison complained that \"the apathy of the people is enough to\\n', 'make every statue leap from its pedestal,\" he soon learned how alive the\\n', 'masses were to the meaning of his propaganda. Abolition orators were\\n', 'stoned in the street and hissed from the platform. Their meeting places\\n', 'were often attacked and sometimes burned to the ground. Garrison himself\\n', 'was assaulted in the streets of Boston, finding refuge from the angry\\n', 'mob behind prison bars. Lovejoy, a publisher in Alton, Illinois, for his\\n', 'willingness to give abolition a fair hearing, was brutally murdered; his\\n', 'printing press was broken to pieces as a warning to all those who\\n', \"disturbed the nation's peace of mind. The South, doubly frightened by a\\n\", 'slave revolt in 1831 which ended in the murder of a number of men,\\n', 'women, and children, closed all discussion of slavery in that section.\\n', '\"Now,\" exclaimed Calhoun, \"it is a question which admits of neither\\n', 'concession nor compromise.\"\\n', '\\n', 'As the opposition hardened, the anti-slavery agitation gathered in force\\n', 'and intensity. Whittier blew his blast from the New England hills:\\n', '\\n', '    \"No slave-hunt in our borders--no pirate on our strand;\\n', '     No fetters in the Bay State--no slave upon our land.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Lowell, looking upon the espousal of a great cause as the noblest aim of\\n', 'his art, ridiculed and excoriated bondage in the South. Those\\n', 'abolitionists, not gifted as speakers or writers, signed petitions\\n', 'against slavery and poured them in upon Congress. The flood of them was\\n', 'so continuous that the House of Representatives, forgetting its\\n', 'traditions, adopted in 1836 a \"gag rule\" which prevented the reading of\\n', 'appeals and consigned them to the waste basket. Not until the Whigs were\\n', 'in power nearly ten years later was John Quincy Adams able, after a\\n', 'relentless campaign, to carry a motion rescinding the rule.\\n', '\\n', 'How deep was the impression made upon the country by this agitation for\\n', 'immediate and unconditional emancipation cannot be measured. If the\\n', 'popular vote for those candidates who opposed not slavery, but its\\n', 'extension to the territories, be taken as a standard, it was slight\\n', 'indeed. In 1844, the Free Soil candidate, Birney, polled 62,000 votes\\n', 'out of over a million and a half; the Free Soil vote of the next\\n', 'campaign went beyond a quarter of a million, but the increase was due to\\n', 'the strength of the leader, Martin Van Buren; four years afterward it\\n', 'receded to 156,000, affording all the outward signs for the belief that\\n', 'the pleas of the abolitionist found no widespread response among the\\n', 'people. Yet the agitation undoubtedly ran deeper than the ballot box.\\n', 'Young statesmen of the North, in whose hands the destiny of frightful\\n', 'years was to lie, found their indifference to slavery broken and their\\n', 'consciences stirred by the unending appeal and the tireless reiteration.\\n', 'Charles Sumner afterward boasted that he read the _Liberator_ two years\\n', 'before Wendell Phillips, the young Boston lawyer who cast aside his\\n', 'profession to take up the dangerous cause.\\n', '\\n', '=Early Southern Opposition to Slavery.=--In the South, the sentiment\\n', 'against slavery was strong; it led some to believe that it would also\\n', 'come to an end there in due time. Washington disliked it and directed in\\n', 'his will that his own slaves should be set free after the death of his\\n', 'wife. Jefferson, looking into the future, condemned the system by which\\n', 'he also lived, saying: \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure\\n', 'when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of\\n', 'the people that their liberties are the gift of God? Are they not to be\\n', 'reflect that God is just; that His justice cannot sleep forever.\" Nor\\n', 'did Southern men confine their sentiments to expressions of academic\\n', 'opinion. They accepted in 1787 the Ordinance which excluded slavery from\\n', 'the Northwest territory forever and also the Missouri Compromise, which\\n', 'shut it out of a vast section of the Louisiana territory.\\n', '\\n', '=The Revolution in the Slave System.=--Among the representatives of\\n', 'South Carolina and Georgia, however, the anti-slavery views of\\n', 'Washington and Jefferson were by no means approved; and the drift of\\n', 'Southern economy was decidedly in favor of extending and perpetuating,\\n', 'rather than abolishing, the system of chattel servitude. The invention\\n', 'of the cotton gin and textile machinery created a market for cotton\\n', 'which the planters, with all their skill and energy, could hardly\\n', 'supply. Almost every available acre was brought under cotton culture as\\n', 'the small farmers were driven steadily from the seaboard into the\\n', 'uplands or to the Northwest.\\n', '\\n', 'The demand for slaves to till the swiftly expanding fields was enormous.\\n', \"The number of bondmen rose from 700,000 in Washington's day to more than\\n\", 'three millions in 1850. At the same time slavery itself was transformed.\\n', 'Instead of the homestead where the same family of masters kept the same\\n', 'families of slaves from generation to generation, came the plantation\\n', 'system of the Far South and Southwest where masters were ever moving and\\n', 'ever extending their holdings of lands and slaves. This in turn reacted\\n', 'on the older South where the raising of slaves for the market became a\\n', 'regular and highly profitable business.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Slavery Defended as a Positive Good.=--As the abolition agitation\\n', 'increased and the planting system expanded, apologies for slavery became\\n', 'fainter and fainter in the South. Then apologies were superseded by\\n', 'claims that slavery was a beneficial scheme of labor control. Calhoun,\\n', 'in a famous speech in the Senate in 1837, sounded the new note by\\n', 'declaring slavery \"instead of an evil, a good--a positive good.\" His\\n', 'reasoning was as follows: in every civilized society one portion of the\\n', 'community must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the\\n', 'arts are built upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his\\n', 'master and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than\\n', 'the free laborers of Europe; and under the slave system conflicts\\n', 'between capital and labor are avoided. The advantages of slavery in this\\n', 'respect, he concluded, \"will become more and more manifest, if left\\n', 'undisturbed by interference from without, as the country advances in\\n', 'wealth and numbers.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Slave Owners Dominate Politics.=--The new doctrine of Calhoun was\\n', 'eagerly seized by the planters as they came more and more to overshadow\\n', 'the small farmers of the South and as they beheld the menace of\\n', 'abolition growing upon the horizon. It formed, as they viewed matters, a\\n', 'moral defense for their labor system--sound, logical, invincible. It\\n', 'warranted them in drawing together for the protection of an institution\\n', 'so necessary, so inevitable, so beneficent.\\n', '\\n', 'Though in 1850 the slave owners were only about three hundred and fifty\\n', 'thousand in a national population of nearly twenty million whites, they\\n', 'had an influence all out of proportion to their numbers. They were knit\\n', 'together by the bonds of a common interest. They had leisure and wealth.\\n', 'They could travel and attend conferences and conventions. Throughout the\\n', 'South and largely in the North, they had the press, the schools, and the\\n', 'pulpits on their side. They formed, as it were, a mighty union for the\\n', 'protection and advancement of their common cause. Aided by those\\n', 'mechanics and farmers of the North who stuck by Jacksonian Democracy\\n', 'through thick and thin, the planters became a power in the federal\\n', 'government. \"We nominate Presidents,\" exultantly boasted a Richmond\\n', 'newspaper; \"the North elects them.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Republican Senator from New York, in a speech describing the power of\\n', 'a joint stock association, in which those who contribute most direct the\\n', 'action and management of the concern.... The slaveholders, contributing\\n', 'in an overwhelming proportion to the strength of the Democratic party,\\n', 'necessarily dictate and prescribe its policy.\" He went on: \"The\\n', 'slaveholding class has become the governing power in each of the\\n', 'slaveholding states and it practically chooses thirty of the sixty-two\\n', 'members of the Senate, ninety of the two hundred and thirty-three\\n', 'members of the House of Representatives, and one hundred and five of the\\n', 'two hundred and ninety-five electors of President and Vice-President of\\n', 'the United States.\" Then he considered the slave power in the Supreme\\n', 'Court. \"That tribunal,\" he exclaimed, \"consists of a chief justice and\\n', 'eight associate justices. Of these, five were called from slave states\\n', 'and four from free states. The opinions and bias of each of them were\\n', 'carefully considered by the President and Senate when he was appointed.\\n', 'Not one of them was found wanting in soundness of politics, according to\\n', 'the slaveholder\\'s exposition of the Constitution.\" Such was the Northern\\n', 'view of the planting interest that, from the arena of national politics,\\n', 'challenged the whole country in 1860.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=National Aspects of Slavery.=--It may be asked why it was that slavery,\\n', 'founded originally on state law and subject to state government, was\\n', 'drawn into the current of national affairs. The answer is simple. There\\n', 'were, in the first place, constitutional reasons. The Congress of the\\n', 'United States had to make all needful rules for the government of the\\n', 'territories, the District of Columbia, the forts and other property\\n', 'under national authority; so it was compelled to determine whether\\n', 'slavery should exist in the places subject to its jurisdiction. Upon\\n', 'Congress was also conferred the power of admitting new states; whenever\\n', 'a territory asked for admission, the issue could be raised as to whether\\n', 'slavery should be sanctioned or excluded. Under the Constitution,\\n', 'provision was made for the return of runaway slaves; Congress had the\\n', 'power to enforce this clause by appropriate legislation. Since the\\n', 'control of the post office was vested in the federal government, it had\\n', 'to face the problem raised by the transmission of abolition literature\\n', 'through the mails. Finally citizens had the right of petition; it\\n', 'inheres in all free government and it is expressly guaranteed by the\\n', 'first amendment to the Constitution. It was therefore legal for\\n', 'abolitionists to present to Congress their petitions, even if they asked\\n', 'for something which it had no right to grant. It was thus impossible,\\n', 'constitutionally, to draw a cordon around the slavery issue and confine\\n', 'the discussion of it to state politics.\\n', '\\n', 'There were, in the second place, economic reasons why slavery was\\n', 'inevitably drawn into the national sphere. It was the basis of the\\n', 'planting system which had direct commercial relations with the North and\\n', 'European countries; it was affected by federal laws respecting tariffs,\\n', 'bounties, ship subsidies, banking, and kindred matters. The planters of\\n', 'the South, almost without exception, looked upon the protective tariff\\n', 'as a tribute laid upon them for the benefit of Northern industries. As\\n', 'heavy borrowers of money in the North, they were generally in favor of\\n', '\"easy money,\" if not paper currency, as an aid in the repayment of their\\n', 'debts. This threw most of them into opposition to the Whig program for a\\n', 'United States Bank. All financial aids to American shipping they stoutly\\n', 'resisted, preferring to rely upon the cheaper service rendered by\\n', 'English shippers. Internal improvements, those substantial ties that\\n', 'were binding the West to the East and turning the traffic from New\\n', 'Orleans to Philadelphia and New York, they viewed with alarm. Free\\n', 'homesteads from the public lands, which tended to overbalance the South\\n', 'by building free states, became to them a measure dangerous to their\\n', 'interests. Thus national economic policies, which could not by any twist\\n', 'or turn be confined to state control, drew the slave system and its\\n', 'defenders into the political conflict that centered at Washington.\\n', '\\n', '=Slavery and the Territories--the Missouri Compromise (1820).=--Though\\n', 'men continually talked about \"taking slavery out of politics,\" it could\\n', 'not be done. By 1818 slavery had become so entrenched and the\\n', \"anti-slavery sentiment so strong, that Missouri's quest for admission\\n\", 'brought both houses of Congress into a deadlock that was broken only by\\n', 'compromise. The South, having half the Senators, could prevent the\\n', 'admission of Missouri stripped of slavery; and the North, powerful in\\n', 'the House of Representatives, could keep Missouri with slavery out of\\n', 'the union indefinitely. An adjustment of pretensions was the last\\n', 'resort. Maine, separated from the parent state of Massachusetts, was\\n', 'brought into the union with freedom and Missouri with bondage. At the\\n', 'same time it was agreed that the remainder of the vast Louisiana\\n', \"territory north of the parallel of 36 o 30' should be, like the old\\n\", 'Northwest, forever free; while the southern portion was left to slavery.\\n', 'In reality this was an immense gain for liberty. The area dedicated to\\n', 'free farmers was many times greater than that left to the planters. The\\n', 'principle was once more asserted that Congress had full power to prevent\\n', 'slavery in the territories.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Territorial Question Reopened by the Wilmot Proviso.=--To the\\n', 'Southern leaders, the annexation of Texas and the conquest of Mexico\\n', 'meant renewed security to the planting interest against the increasing\\n', 'wealth and population of the North. Texas, it was said, could be divided\\n', 'into four slave states. The new territories secured by the treaty of\\n', 'peace with Mexico contained the promise of at least three more. Thus, as\\n', 'each new free soil state knocked for admission into the union, the\\n', 'South could demand as the price of its consent a new slave state. No\\n', 'wonder Southern statesmen saw, in the annexation of Texas and the\\n', 'conquest of Mexico, slavery and King Cotton triumphant--secure for all\\n', 'time against adverse legislation. Northern leaders were equally\\n', 'convinced that the Southern prophecy was true. Abolitionists and\\n', 'moderate opponents of slavery alike were in despair. Texas, they\\n', 'lamented, would fasten slavery upon the country forevermore. \"No living\\n', 'man,\" cried one, \"will see the end of slavery in the United States!\"\\n', '\\n', 'It so happened, however, that the events which, it was thought, would\\n', 'August 6, 1846, only a few months after war was declared on Mexico. On\\n', 'that day, David Wilmot, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, introduced into\\n', 'the House of Representatives a resolution to the effect that, as an\\n', 'express and fundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory\\n', 'from the republic of Mexico, slavery should be forever excluded from\\n', 'every part of it. \"The Wilmot Proviso,\" as the resolution was popularly\\n', 'called, though defeated on that occasion, was a challenge to the South.\\n', '\\n', 'The South answered the challenge. Speaking in the House of\\n', 'Representatives, Robert Toombs of Georgia boldly declared: \"In the\\n', 'presence of the living God, if by your legislation you seek to drive us\\n', 'disunion.\" South Carolina announced that the day for talk had passed and\\n', 'the time had come to join her sister states \"in resisting the\\n', 'assembled at Jackson, Mississippi, in the autumn of 1849, called a\\n', 'general convention of Southern states to meet at Nashville the following\\n', 'summer. The avowed purpose was to arrest \"the course of aggression\" and,\\n', 'if that was not possible, to provide \"in the last resort for their\\n', 'separate welfare by the formation of a compact and union that will\\n', 'afford protection to their liberties and rights.\" States that had\\n', \"spurned South Carolina's plea for nullification in 1832 responded to\\n\", 'this new appeal with alacrity--an augury of the secession to come.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Great Debate of 1850.=--The temper of the country was white hot\\n', 'when Congress convened in December, 1849. It was a memorable session,\\n', 'memorable for the great men who took part in the debates and memorable\\n', 'for the grand Compromise of 1850 which it produced. In the Senate sat\\n', 'for the last time three heroic figures: Webster from the North, Calhoun\\n', 'from the South, and Clay from a border state. For nearly forty years\\n', 'these three had been leaders of men. All had grown old and gray in\\n', 'service. Calhoun was already broken in health and in a few months was to\\n', 'be borne from the political arena forever. Clay and Webster had but two\\n', 'more years in their allotted span.\\n', '\\n', 'Experience, learning, statecraft--all these things they now marshaled in\\n', 'a mighty effort to solve the slavery problem. On January 29, 1850, Clay\\n', 'offered to the Senate a compromise granting concessions to both sides;\\n', 'and a few days later, in a powerful oration, he made a passionate appeal\\n', 'for a union of hearts through mutual sacrifices. Calhoun relentlessly\\n', 'demanded the full measure of justice for the South: equal rights in the\\n', 'territories bought by common blood; the return of runaway slaves as\\n', 'required by the Constitution; the suppression of the abolitionists; and\\n', 'the restoration of the balance of power between the North and the South.\\n', 'Webster, in his notable \"Seventh of March speech,\" condemned the Wilmot\\n', 'Proviso, advocated a strict enforcement of the fugitive slave law,\\n', 'denounced the abolitionists, and made a final plea for the Constitution,\\n', 'union, and liberty. This was the address which called forth from\\n', 'Whittier the poem, \"Ichabod,\" deploring the fall of the mighty one whom\\n', 'he thought lost to all sense of faith and honor.\\n', '\\n', '=The Terms of the Compromise of 1850.=--When the debates were closed,\\n', 'the results were totaled in a series of compromise measures, all of\\n', 'which were signed in September, 1850, by the new President, Millard\\n', 'Fillmore, who had taken office two months before on the death of Zachary\\n', 'Taylor. By these acts the boundaries of Texas were adjusted and the\\n', 'territory of New Mexico created, subject to the provision that all or\\n', 'any part of it might be admitted to the union \"with or without slavery\\n', 'as their constitution may provide at the time of their admission.\" The\\n', 'Territory of Utah was similarly organized with the same conditions as to\\n', 'slavery, thus repudiating the Wilmot Proviso without guaranteeing\\n', 'slavery to the planters. California was admitted as a free state under a\\n', 'constitution in which the people of the territory had themselves\\n', 'prohibited slavery.\\n', '\\n', 'The slave trade was abolished in the District of Columbia, but slavery\\n', 'itself existed as before at the capital of the nation. This concession\\n', 'to anti-slavery sentiment was more than offset by a fugitive slave law,\\n', 'drastic in spirit and in letter. It placed the enforcement of its terms\\n', 'in the hands of federal officers appointed from Washington and so\\n', 'removed it from the control of authorities locally elected. It provided\\n', 'that masters or their agents, on filing claims in due form, might\\n', 'summarily remove their escaped slaves without affording their \"alleged\\n', 'fugitives\" the right of trial by jury, the right to witness, the right\\n', 'to offer any testimony in evidence. Finally, to \"put teeth\" into the\\n', 'act, heavy penalties were prescribed for all who obstructed or assisted\\n', 'in obstructing the enforcement of the law. Such was the Great Compromise\\n', 'of 1850.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Pro-slavery Triumph in the Election of 1852.=--The results of the\\n', 'election of 1852 seemed to show conclusively that the nation was weary\\n', 'of slavery agitation and wanted peace. Both parties, Whigs and\\n', 'Democrats, endorsed the fugitive slave law and approved the Great\\n', 'Compromise. The Democrats, with Franklin Pierce as their leader, swept\\n', 'the country against the war hero, General Winfield Scott, on whom the\\n', 'Whigs had staked their hopes. Even Webster, broken with grief at his\\n', 'failure to receive the nomination, advised his friends to vote for\\n', 'Pierce and turned away from politics to meditate upon approaching death.\\n', 'The verdict of the voters would seem to indicate that for the time\\n', \"everybody, save a handful of disgruntled agitators, looked upon Clay's\\n\", 'settlement as the last word. \"The people, especially the business men of\\n', 'the country,\" says Elson, \"were utterly weary of the agitation and they\\n', 'gave their suffrages to the party that promised them rest.\" The Free\\n', 'Soil party, condemning slavery as \"a sin against God and a crime against\\n', 'man,\" and advocating freedom for the territories, failed to carry a\\n', 'single state. In fact it polled fewer votes than it had four years\\n', 'Whigs and Democrats. It is not surprising, therefore, that President\\n', 'Pierce, surrounded in his cabinet by strong Southern sympathizers, could\\n', 'promise to put an end to slavery agitation and to crush the abolition\\n', 'movement in the bud.\\n', '\\n', '=Anti-slavery Agitation Continued.=--The promise was more difficult to\\n', 'fulfill than to utter. In fact, the vigorous execution of one measure\\n', 'included in the Compromise--the fugitive slave law--only made matters\\n', 'worse. Designed as security for the planters, it proved a powerful\\n', 'instrument in their undoing. Slavery five hundred miles away on a\\n', 'Louisiana plantation was so remote from the North that only the\\n', 'strongest imagination could maintain a constant rage against it. \"Slave\\n', 'catching,\" \"man hunting\" by federal officers on the streets of\\n', 'Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Chicago, or Milwaukee and in the hamlets\\n', 'and villages of the wide-stretching farm lands of the North was another\\n', 'matter. It brought the most odious aspects of slavery home to thousands\\n', 'of men and women who would otherwise have been indifferent to the\\n', 'system. Law-abiding business men, mechanics, farmers, and women, when\\n', 'they saw peaceful negroes, who had resided in their neighborhoods\\n', 'perhaps for years, torn away by federal officers and carried back to\\n', 'bondage, were transformed into enemies of the law. They helped slaves to\\n', 'escape; they snatched them away from officers who had captured them;\\n', 'they broke open jails and carried fugitives off to Canada.\\n', '\\n', 'Assistance to runaway slaves, always more or less common in the North,\\n', 'was by this time organized into a system. Regular routes, known as\\n', '\"underground railways,\" were laid out across the free states into\\n', 'Canada, and trusted friends of freedom maintained \"underground stations\"\\n', 'where fugitives were concealed in the daytime between their long night\\n', 'journeys. Funds were raised and secret agents sent into the South to\\n', 'help negroes to flee. One negro woman, Harriet Tubman, \"the Moses of her\\n', 'people,\" with headquarters at Philadelphia, is accredited with nineteen\\n', 'invasions into slave territory and the emancipation of three hundred\\n', 'negroes. Those who worked at this business were in constant peril. One\\n', 'underground operator, Calvin Fairbank, spent nearly twenty years in\\n', 'prison for aiding fugitives from justice. Yet perils and prisons did not\\n', 'stay those determined men and women who, in obedience to their\\n', 'consciences, set themselves to this lawless work.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'From thrilling stories of adventure along the underground railways came\\n', 'some of the scenes and themes of the novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe,\\n', '\"Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin,\" published two years after the Compromise of 1850.\\n', 'Her stirring tale set forth the worst features of slavery in vivid word\\n', 'pictures that caught and held the attention of millions of readers.\\n', 'Though the book was unfair to the South and was denounced as a hideous\\n', 'distortion of the truth, it was quickly dramatized and played in every\\n', 'city and town throughout the North. Topsy, Little Eva, Uncle Tom, the\\n', 'fleeing slave, Eliza Harris, and the cruel slave driver, Simon Legree,\\n', 'with his baying blood hounds, became living specters in many a home that\\n', 'sought to bar the door to the \"unpleasant and irritating business of\\n', 'slavery agitation.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Repeal of the Missouri Compromise.=--To practical men, after all, the\\n', '\"rub-a-dub\" agitation of a few abolitionists, an occasional riot over\\n', 'fugitive slaves, and the vogue of a popular novel seemed of slight or\\n', 'transient importance. They could point with satisfaction to the election\\n', 'returns of 1852; but their very security was founded upon shifting\\n', 'sands. The magnificent triumph of the pro-slavery Democrats in 1852\\n', 'brought a turn in affairs that destroyed the foundations under their\\n', 'feet. Emboldened by their own strength and the weakness of their\\n', 'opponents, they now dared to repeal the Missouri Compromise. The leader\\n', 'Illinois, and the occasion for the deed was the demand for the\\n', 'organization of territorial government in the regions west of Iowa and\\n', 'Missouri.\\n', '\\n', 'Douglas, like Clay and Webster before him, was consumed by a strong\\n', 'passion for the presidency, and, to reach his goal, it was necessary to\\n', 'win the support of the South. This he undoubtedly sought to do when he\\n', 'introduced on January 4, 1854, a bill organizing the Nebraska territory\\n', 'on the principle of the Compromise of 1850; namely, that the people in\\n', 'the territory might themselves decide whether they would have slavery or\\n', 'not. Unwittingly the avalanche was started.\\n', '\\n', 'After a stormy debate, in which important amendments were forced on\\n', 'Douglas, the Kansas-Nebraska Bill became a law on May 30, 1854. The\\n', 'measure created two territories, Kansas and Nebraska, and provided that\\n', 'they, or territories organized out of them, could come into the union as\\n', 'states \"with or without slavery as their constitutions may prescribe at\\n', 'the time of their admission.\" Not content with this, the law went on to\\n', 'declare the Missouri Compromise null and void as being inconsistent with\\n', 'the principle of non-intervention by Congress with slavery in the states\\n', 'and territories. Thus by a single blow the very heart of the continent,\\n', 'desperate struggle between slave owners and the advocates of freedom was\\n', 'the outcome in Kansas.\\n', '\\n', 'If Douglas fancied that the North would receive the overthrow of the\\n', \"Missouri Compromise in the same temper that it greeted Clay's\\n\", 'its fury, swept from Maine to Iowa. Staid old Boston hanged him in\\n', 'Nebraska bill: the Benedict Arnold of 1854.\" City after city burned him\\n', 'in effigy until, as he himself said, he could travel from the Atlantic\\n', 'coast to Chicago in the light of the fires. Thousands of Whigs and\\n', 'Free-soil Democrats deserted their parties which had sanctioned or at\\n', 'least tolerated the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, declaring that the startling\\n', 'measure showed an evident resolve on the part of the planters to rule\\n', 'abolitionists. An issue was set even for the moderate and timid who had\\n', 'been unmoved by the agitation over slavery in the Far South. That issue\\n', 'was whether slavery was to be confined within its existing boundaries or\\n', 'be allowed to spread without interference, thereby placing the free\\n', 'states in the minority and surrendering the federal government wholly to\\n', 'the slave power.\\n', '\\n', '=The Rise of the Republican Party.=--Events of terrible significance,\\n', 'swiftly following, drove the country like a ship before a gale straight\\n', 'into civil war. The Kansas-Nebraska Bill rent the old parties asunder\\n', 'and called into being the Republican party. While that bill was pending\\n', 'in Congress, many Northern Whigs and Democrats had come to the\\n', 'conclusion that a new party dedicated to freedom in the territories must\\n', 'follow the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Several places claim to be\\n', 'the original home of the Republican party; but historians generally\\n', 'yield it to Wisconsin. At Ripon in that state, a mass meeting of Whigs\\n', 'and Democrats assembled in February, 1854, and resolved to form a new\\n', 'party if the Kansas-Nebraska Bill should pass. At a second meeting a\\n', 'fusion committee representing Whigs, Free Soilers, and Democrats was\\n', \"formed and the name Republican--the name of Jefferson's old party--was\\n\", 'selected. All over the country similar meetings were held and political\\n', 'committees were organized.\\n', '\\n', 'When the presidential campaign of 1856 began the Republicans entered the\\n', 'contest. After a preliminary conference in Pittsburgh in February, they\\n', 'held a convention in Philadelphia at which was drawn up a platform\\n', 'the distinguished explorer, was named for the presidency. The results\\n', 'of the election were astounding as compared with the Free-soil failure\\n', 'of the preceding election. Prominent men like Longfellow, Washington\\n', 'Irving, William Cullen Bryant, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and George William\\n', 'Curtis went over to the new party and 1,341,264 votes were rolled up for\\n', '\"free labor, free speech, free men, free Kansas, and Fremont.\"\\n', 'Nevertheless the victory of the Democrats was decisive. Their candidate,\\n', 'James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, was elected by a majority of 174 to 114\\n', 'electoral votes.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Dred Scott Decision (1857).=--In his inaugural, Buchanan vaguely\\n', 'hinted that in a forthcoming decision the Supreme Court would settle one\\n', 'of the vital questions of the day. This was a reference to the Dred\\n', 'Scott case then pending. Scott was a slave who had been taken by his\\n', 'master into the upper Louisiana territory, where freedom had been\\n', 'established by the Missouri Compromise, and then carried back into his\\n', 'old state of Missouri. He brought suit for his liberty on the ground\\n', 'that his residence in the free territory made him free. This raised the\\n', 'question whether the law of Congress prohibiting slavery north of 36 o\\n', \"30' was authorized by the federal Constitution or not. The Court might\\n\", 'have avoided answering it by saying that even though Scott was free in\\n', 'the territory, he became a slave again in Missouri by virtue of the law\\n', 'of that state. The Court, however, faced the issue squarely. It held\\n', 'that Scott had not been free anywhere and that, besides, the Missouri\\n', 'Compromise violated the Constitution and was null and void.\\n', '\\n', 'The decision was a triumph for the South. It meant that Congress after\\n', 'all had no power to abolish slavery in the territories. Under the decree\\n', 'of the highest court in the land, that could be done only by an\\n', 'amendment to the Constitution which required a two-thirds vote in\\n', 'Congress and the approval of three-fourths of the states. Such an\\n', 'amendment was obviously impossible--the Southern states were too\\n', 'numerous; but the Republicans were not daunted. \"We know,\" said Lincoln,\\n', '\"the Court that made it has often overruled its own decisions and we\\n', 'shall do what we can to have it overrule this.\" Legislatures of Northern\\n', 'states passed resolutions condemning the decision and the Republican\\n', 'platform of 1860 characterized the dogma that the Constitution carried\\n', 'slavery into the territories as \"a dangerous political heresy at\\n', 'variance with the explicit provisions of that instrument itself ... with\\n', 'legislative and judicial precedent ... revolutionary in tendency and\\n', 'subversive of the peace and harmony of the country.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Panic of 1857.=--In the midst of the acrimonious dispute over the\\n', 'Dred Scott decision, came one of the worst business panics which ever\\n', 'afflicted the country. In the spring and summer of 1857, fourteen\\n', 'railroad corporations, including the Erie, Michigan Central, and the\\n', 'Illinois Central, failed to meet their obligations; banks and insurance\\n', 'companies, some of them the largest and strongest institutions in the\\n', 'North, closed their doors; stocks and bonds came down in a crash on the\\n', 'markets; manufacturing was paralyzed; tens of thousands of working\\n', 'people were thrown out of employment; \"hunger meetings\" of idle men were\\n', 'held in the cities and banners bearing the inscription, \"We want\\n', 'bread,\" were flung out. In New York, working men threatened to invade\\n', 'the Council Chamber to demand \"work or bread,\" and the frightened mayor\\n', 'called for the police and soldiers. For this distressing state of\\n', 'affairs many remedies were offered; none with more zeal and persistence\\n', 'than the proposal for a higher tariff to take the place of the law of\\n', 'March, 1857, a Democratic measure making drastic reductions in the rates\\n', 'of duty. In the manufacturing districts of the North, the panic was\\n', 'ascribed to the \"Democratic assault on business.\" So an old issue was\\n', 'again vigorously advanced, preparatory to the next presidential\\n', 'campaign.\\n', '\\n', '=The Lincoln-Douglas Debates.=--The following year the interest of the\\n', 'whole country was drawn to a series of debates held in Illinois by\\n', 'Lincoln and Douglas, both candidates for the United States Senate. In\\n', 'the course of his campaign Lincoln had uttered his trenchant saying that\\n', 'cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.\" At the same time he\\n', 'had accused Douglas, Buchanan, and the Supreme Court of acting in\\n', 'concert to make slavery national. This daring statement arrested the\\n', 'attention of Douglas, who was making his campaign on the doctrine of\\n', '\"squatter sovereignty;\" that is, the right of the people of each\\n', 'territory \"to vote slavery up or down.\" After a few long-distance shots\\n', 'at each other, the candidates agreed to meet face to face and discuss\\n', 'the issues of the day. Never had such crowds been seen at political\\n', 'meetings in Illinois. Farmers deserted their plows, smiths their forges,\\n', 'and housewives their baking to hear \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Little Giant.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The results of the series of debates were momentous. Lincoln clearly\\n', 'defined his position. The South, he admitted, was entitled under the\\n', 'Constitution to a fair, fugitive slave law. He hoped that there might be\\n', 'no new slave states; but he did not see how Congress could exclude the\\n', 'people of a territory from admission as a state if they saw fit to adopt\\n', 'a constitution legalizing the ownership of slaves. He favored the\\n', 'gradual abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia and the total\\n', 'exclusion of it from the territories of the United States by act of\\n', 'Congress.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, he drove Douglas into a hole by asking how he squared\\n', '\"squatter sovereignty\" with the Dred Scott decision; how, in other\\n', 'words, the people of a territory could abolish slavery when the Court\\n', 'had declared that Congress, the superior power, could not do it under\\n', 'the Constitution? To this baffling question Douglas lamely replied that\\n', 'the inhabitants of a territory, by \"unfriendly legislation,\" might make\\n', 'property in slaves insecure and thus destroy the institution. This\\n', \"answer to Lincoln's query alienated many Southern Democrats who believed\\n\", 'that the Dred Scott decision settled the question of slavery in the\\n', 'territories for all time. Douglas won the election to the Senate; but\\n', 'Lincoln, lifted into national fame by the debates, beat him in the\\n', 'campaign for President two years later.\\n', '\\n', \"=John Brown's Raid.=--To the abolitionists the line of argument pursued\\n\", 'by Lincoln, including his proposal to leave slavery untouched in the\\n', 'states where it existed, was wholly unsatisfactory. One of them, a grim\\n', 'and resolute man, inflamed by a hatred for slavery in itself, turned\\n', 'from agitation to violence. \"These men are all talk; what is needed is\\n', 'action--action!\" So spoke John Brown of New York. During the sanguinary\\n', 'struggle in Kansas he hurried to the frontier, gun and dagger in hand,\\n', 'to help drive slave owners from the free soil of the West. There he\\n', 'committed deeds of such daring and cruelty that he was outlawed and a\\n', 'price put upon his head. Still he kept on the path of \"action.\" Aided by\\n', 'funds from Northern friends, he gathered a small band of his followers\\n', 'around him, saying to them: \"If God be for us, who can be against us?\"\\n', 'He went into Virginia in the autumn of 1859, hoping, as he explained,\\n', '\"to effect a mighty conquest even though it be like the last victory of\\n', 'Samson.\" He seized the government armory at Harper\\'s Ferry, declared\\n', 'free the slaves whom he found, and called upon them to take up arms in\\n', 'defense of their liberty. His was a hope as forlorn as it was desperate.\\n', 'Armed forces came down upon him and, after a hard battle, captured him.\\n', 'Tried for treason, Brown was condemned to death. The governor of\\n', 'Virginia turned a deaf ear to pleas for clemency based on the ground\\n', 'that the prisoner was simply a lunatic. \"This is a beautiful country,\"\\n', 'said the stern old Brown glancing upward to the eternal hills on his way\\n', 'to the gallows, as calmly as if he were returning home from a long\\n', 'journey. \"So perish all such enemies of Virginia. All such enemies of\\n', 'the Union. All such foes of the human race,\" solemnly announced the\\n', 'executioner as he fulfilled the judgment of the law.\\n', '\\n', 'The raid and its grim ending deeply moved the country. Abolitionists\\n', 'looked upon Brown as a martyr and tolled funeral bells on the day of his\\n', 'execution. Longfellow wrote in his diary: \"This will be a great day in\\n', 'our history; the date of a new revolution as much needed as the old\\n', 'one.\" Jefferson Davis saw in the affair \"the invasion of a state by a\\n', 'murderous gang of abolitionists bent on inciting slaves to murder\\n', 'helpless women and children\"--a crime for which the leader had met a\\n', \"felon's death. Lincoln spoke of the raid as absurd, the deed of an\\n\", 'enthusiast who had brooded over the oppression of a people until he\\n', 'fancied himself commissioned by heaven to liberate them--an attempt\\n', 'which ended in \"little else than his own execution.\" To Republican\\n', 'leaders as a whole, the event was very embarrassing. They were taunted\\n', 'by the Democrats with responsibility for the deed. Douglas declared his\\n', '\"firm and deliberate conviction that the Harper\\'s Ferry crime was the\\n', 'natural, logical, inevitable result of the doctrines and teachings of\\n', 'the Republican party.\" So persistent were such attacks that the\\n', 'Republicans felt called upon in 1860 to denounce Brown\\'s raid \"as among\\n', 'the gravest of crimes.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Democrats Divided.=--When the Democratic convention met at\\n', \"Charleston in the spring of 1860, a few months after Brown's execution,\\n\", 'it soon became clear that there was danger ahead. Between the extreme\\n', 'slavery advocates of the Far South and the so-called pro-slavery\\n', 'Democrats of the Douglas type, there was a chasm which no appeals to\\n', 'party loyalty could bridge. As the spokesman of the West, Douglas knew\\n', 'that, while the North was not abolitionist, it was passionately set\\n', 'against an extension of slavery into the territories by act of Congress;\\n', 'that squatter sovereignty was the mildest kind of compromise acceptable\\n', 'to the farmers whose votes would determine the fate of the election.\\n', 'Southern leaders would not accept his opinion. Yancey, speaking for\\n', 'Alabama, refused to palter with any plan not built on the proposition\\n', 'that slavery was in itself right. He taunted the Northern Democrats with\\n', 'taking the view that slavery was wrong, but that they could not do\\n', 'anything about it. That, he said, was the fatal error--the cause of all\\n', 'discord, the source of \"Black Republicanism,\" as well as squatter\\n', 'sovereignty. The gauntlet was thus thrown down at the feet of the\\n', 'Northern delegates: \"You must not apologize for slavery; you must\\n', 'declare it right; you must advocate its extension.\" The challenge, so\\n', 'bluntly put, was as bluntly answered. \"Gentlemen of the South,\"\\n', 'responded a delegate from Ohio, \"you mistake us. You mistake us. We will\\n', 'not do it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'For ten days the Charleston convention wrangled over the platform and\\n', 'balloted for the nomination of a candidate. Douglas, though in the lead,\\n', 'could not get the two-thirds vote required for victory. For more than\\n', 'fifty times the roll of the convention was called without a decision.\\n', 'Then in sheer desperation the convention adjourned to meet later at\\n', 'Baltimore. When the delegates again assembled, their passions ran as\\n', 'high as ever. The division into two irreconcilable factions was\\n', 'unchanged. Uncompromising delegates from the South withdrew to Richmond,\\n', 'a platform asserting the rights of slave owners in the territories and\\n', 'the duty of the federal government to protect them. The delegates who\\n', 'remained at Baltimore nominated Douglas and endorsed his doctrine of\\n', 'squatter sovereignty.\\n', '\\n', '=The Constitutional Union Party.=--While the Democratic party was being\\n', 'disrupted, a fragment of the former Whig party, known as the\\n', 'Constitutional Unionists, held a convention at Baltimore and selected\\n', 'national candidates: John Bell from Tennessee and Edward Everett from\\n', 'mainly composed of old men whose political views were those of Clay and\\n', 'Webster, cherished leaders now dead and gone. In their platform they\\n', 'sought to exorcise the evil spirit of partisanship by inviting their\\n', 'fellow citizens to \"support the Constitution of the country, the union\\n', 'of the states, and the enforcement of the laws.\" The party that\\n', 'campaigned on this grand sentiment only drew laughter from the Democrats\\n', 'and derision from the Republicans and polled less than one-fourth the\\n', 'votes.\\n', '\\n', '=The Republican Convention.=--With the Whigs definitely forced into a\\n', 'separate group, the Republican convention at Chicago was fated to be\\n', 'sectional in character, although five slave states did send delegates.\\n', 'As the Democrats were split, the party that had led a forlorn hope four\\n', 'years before was on the high road to success at last. New and powerful\\n', 'recruits were found. The advocates of a high protective tariff and the\\n', 'friends of free homesteads for farmers and workingmen mingled with\\n', 'enthusiastic foes of slavery. While still firm in their opposition to\\n', 'slavery in the territories, the Republicans went on record in favor of a\\n', 'homestead law granting free lands to settlers and approved customs\\n', 'duties designed \"to encourage the development of the industrial\\n', 'interests of the whole country.\" The platform was greeted with cheers\\n', 'which, according to the stenographic report of the convention, became\\n', 'loud and prolonged as the protective tariff and homestead planks were\\n', 'read.\\n', '\\n', 'Having skillfully drawn a platform to unite the North in opposition to\\n', 'slavery and the planting system, the Republicans were also adroit in\\n', 'their selection of a candidate. The tariff plank might carry\\n', 'Pennsylvania, a Democratic state; but Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were\\n', 'equally essential to success at the polls. The southern counties of\\n', 'these states were filled with settlers from Virginia, North Carolina,\\n', 'and Kentucky who, even if they had no love for slavery, were no friends\\n', 'of abolition. Moreover, remembering the old fight on the United States\\n', \"Bank in Andrew Jackson's day, they were suspicious of men from the East.\\n\", 'Accordingly, they did not favor the candidacy of Seward, the leading\\n', 'Republican statesman and \"favorite son\" of New York.\\n', '\\n', 'After much trading and discussing, the convention came to the conclusion\\n', 'that Abraham Lincoln of Illinois was the most \"available\" candidate. He\\n', 'was of Southern origin, born in Kentucky in 1809, a fact that told\\n', 'heavily in the campaign in the Ohio Valley. He was a man of the soil,\\n', 'the son of poor frontier parents, a pioneer who in his youth had labored\\n', 'in the fields and forests, celebrated far and wide as \"honest Abe, the\\n', 'rail-splitter.\" It was well-known that he disliked slavery, but was no\\n', \"abolitionist. He had come dangerously near to Seward's radicalism in his\\n\", '\"house-divided-against-itself\" speech but he had never committed himself\\n', 'to the reckless doctrine that there was a \"higher law\" than the\\n', 'Constitution. Slavery in the South he tolerated as a bitter fact;\\n', 'slavery in the territories he opposed with all his strength. Of his\\n', 'sincerity there could be no doubt. He was a speaker and writer of\\n', 'singular power, commanding, by the use of simple and homely language,\\n', 'the hearts and minds of those who heard him speak or read his printed\\n', 'words. He had gone far enough in his opposition to slavery; but not too\\n', 'far. He was the man of the hour! Amid lusty cheers from ten thousand\\n', 'throats, Lincoln was nominated for the presidency by the Republicans.

In February, Texas followed. Virginia,\\n', 'hesitating until the bombardment of Fort Sumter forced a conclusion,\\n', 'seceded in April; but fifty-five of the one hundred and forty-three\\n', 'delegates dissented, foreshadowing the creation of the new state of West\\n', 'Virginia which Congress admitted to the union in 1863. In May, North\\n', 'Carolina, Arkansas, and Tennessee announced their independence.\\n', '\\n', '=Secession and the Theories of the Union.=--In severing their relations\\n', 'with the union, the seceding states denied every point in the Northern\\n', 'theory of the Constitution. That theory, as every one knows, was\\n', 'carefully formulated by Webster and elaborated by Lincoln. According to\\n', 'it, the union was older than the states; it was created before the\\n', 'Declaration of Independence for the purpose of common defense. The\\n', 'Articles of Confederation did but strengthen this national bond and the\\n', 'Constitution sealed it forever. The federal government was not a\\n', 'creature of state governments. It was erected by the people and derived\\n', 'its powers directly from them. \"It is,\" said Webster, \"the people\\'s\\n', \"Constitution, the people's government; made for the people; made by the\\n\", 'people; and answerable to the people. The people of the United States\\n', 'have declared that this Constitution shall be the supreme law.\" When a\\n', 'state questions the lawfulness of any act of the federal government, it\\n', 'cannot nullify that act or withdraw from the union; it must abide by the\\n', 'decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. The union of these\\n', \"states is perpetual, ran Lincoln's simple argument in the first\\n\", 'inaugural; the federal Constitution has no provision for its own\\n', 'termination; it can be destroyed only by some action not provided for in\\n', 'the instrument itself; even if it is a compact among all the states the\\n', 'consent of all must be necessary to its dissolution; therefore no state\\n', 'can lawfully get out of the union and acts of violence against the\\n', 'United States are insurrectionary or revolutionary. This was the system\\n', 'which he believed himself bound to defend by his oath of office\\n', '\"registered in heaven.\"\\n', '\\n', 'All this reasoning Southern statesmen utterly rejected. In their opinion\\n', 'the thirteen original states won their independence as separate and\\n', 'sovereign powers. The treaty of peace with Great Britain named them all\\n', 'and acknowledged them \"to be free, sovereign, and independent states.\"\\n', 'The Articles of Confederation very explicitly declared that \"each state\\n', 'retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence.\" The Constitution\\n', 'was a \"league of nations\" formed by an alliance of thirteen separate\\n', 'powers, each one of which ratified the instrument before it was put into\\n', 'effect. They voluntarily entered the union under the Constitution and\\n', 'voluntarily they could leave it. Such was the constitutional doctrine of\\n', 'Hayne, Calhoun, and Jefferson Davis. In seceding, the Southern states\\n', 'had only to follow legal methods, and the transaction would be correct\\n', 'in every particular. So conventions were summoned, elections were held,\\n', 'and \"sovereign assemblies of the people\" set aside the Constitution in\\n', 'the same manner as it had been ratified nearly four score years before.\\n', 'Thus, said the Southern people, the moral judgment was fulfilled and the\\n', 'letter of the law carried into effect.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Formation of the Confederacy.=--Acting on the call of Mississippi,\\n', 'a congress of delegates from the seceded states met at Montgomery,\\n', 'Alabama, and on February 8, 1861, adopted a temporary plan of union. It\\n', 'selected, as provisional president, Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, a\\n', 'man well fitted by experience and moderation for leadership, a graduate\\n', 'of West Point, who had rendered distinguished service on the field of\\n', 'battle in the Mexican War, in public office, and as a member of\\n', 'Congress.\\n', '\\n', 'In March, a permanent constitution of the Confederate states was\\n', 'drafted. It was quickly ratified by the states; elections were held in\\n', 'November; and the government under it went into effect the next year.\\n', 'This new constitution, in form, was very much like the famous instrument\\n', 'drafted at Philadelphia in 1787. It provided for a President, a Senate,\\n', 'and a House of Representatives along almost identical lines. In the\\n', 'powers conferred upon them, however, there were striking differences.\\n', 'The right to appropriate money for internal improvements was expressly\\n', 'withheld; bounties were not to be granted from the treasury nor import\\n', 'duties so laid as to promote or foster any branch of industry. The\\n', 'dignity of the state, if any might be bold enough to question it, was\\n', 'safeguarded in the opening line by the declaration that each acted \"in\\n', 'its sovereign and independent character\" in forming the Southern union.\\n', '\\n', '=Financing the Confederacy.=--No government ever set out upon its career\\n', 'with more perplexing tasks in front of it. The North had a monetary\\n', 'system; the South had to create one. The North had a scheme of taxation\\n', 'that produced large revenues from numerous sources; the South had to\\n', 'formulate and carry out a financial plan. Like the North, the\\n', 'Confederacy expected to secure a large revenue from customs duties,\\n', 'easily collected and little felt among the masses. To this expectation\\n', 'the blockade of Southern ports inaugurated by Lincoln in April, 1861,\\n', 'soon put an end. Following the precedent set by Congress under the\\n', 'Articles of Confederation, the Southern Congress resorted to a direct\\n', 'property tax apportioned among the states, only to meet the failure that\\n', 'might have been foretold.\\n', '\\n', 'The Confederacy also sold bonds, the first issue bringing into the\\n', 'treasury nearly all the specie available in the Southern banks. This\\n', 'specie by unhappy management was early sent abroad to pay for supplies,\\n', 'sapping the foundations of a sound currency system. Large amounts of\\n', 'bonds were sold overseas, commanding at first better terms than those\\n', 'of the North in the markets of London, Paris, and Amsterdam, many an\\n', 'English lord and statesman buying with enthusiasm and confidence to\\n', 'lament within a few years the proofs of his folly. The difficulties of\\n', 'bringing through the blockade any supplies purchased by foreign bond\\n', 'issues, however, nullified the effect of foreign credit and forced the\\n', 'Confederacy back upon the device of paper money. In all approximately\\n', 'one billion dollars streamed from the printing presses, to fall in value\\n', 'at an alarming rate, reaching in January, 1863, the astounding figure of\\n', 'fifty dollars in paper money for one in gold. Every known device was\\n', 'used to prevent its depreciation, without result. To the issues of the\\n', 'Confederate Congress were added untold millions poured out by the states\\n', 'and by private banks.\\n', '\\n', '=Human and Material Resources.=--When we measure strength for strength\\n', 'in those signs of power--men, money, and supplies--it is difficult to\\n', 'see how the South was able to embark on secession and war with such\\n', 'confidence in the outcome. In the Confederacy at the final reckoning\\n', 'there were eleven states in all, to be pitted against twenty-two; a\\n', 'population of nine millions, nearly one-half servile, to be pitted\\n', 'against twenty-two millions; a land without great industries to produce\\n', 'war supplies and without vast capital to furnish war finances, joined in\\n', 'battle with a nation already industrial and fortified by property worth\\n', 'eleven billion dollars. Even after the Confederate Congress authorized\\n', 'conscription in 1862, Southern man power, measured in numbers, was\\n', 'wholly inadequate to uphold the independence which had been declared.\\n', 'How, therefore, could the Confederacy hope to sustain itself against\\n', '\\n', 'such a combination of men, money, and materials as the North could\\n', 'marshal?\\n', '\\n', '=Southern Expectations.=--The answer to this question is to be found in\\n', 'the ideas that prevailed among Southern leaders. First of all, they\\n', 'hoped, in vain, to carry the Confederacy up to the Ohio River; and, with\\n', 'the aid of Missouri, to gain possession of the Mississippi Valley, the\\n', 'granary of the nation. In the second place, they reckoned upon a large\\n', 'and continuous trade with Great Britain--the exchange of cotton for war\\n', 'materials. They likewise expected to receive recognition and open aid\\n', 'from European powers that looked with satisfaction upon the breakup of\\n', 'the great American republic. In the third place, they believed that\\n', 'their control over several staples so essential to Northern industry\\n', 'would enable them to bring on an industrial crisis in the manufacturing\\n', '1860, \"that the slave-holding South is now the controlling power of the\\n', 'world; that no other power would face us in hostility. Cotton, rice,\\n', 'tobacco, and naval stores command the world; and we have the sense to\\n', 'know it and are sufficiently Teutonic to carry it out successfully. The\\n', 'North without us would be a motherless calf, bleating about, and die of\\n', 'mange and starvation.\"\\n', '\\n', 'There were other grounds for confidence. Having seized all of the\\n', 'federal military and naval supplies in the South, and having left the\\n', 'national government weak in armed power during their possession of the\\n', 'presidency, Southern leaders looked to a swift war, if it came at all,\\n', 'to put the finishing stroke to independence. \"The greasy mechanics of\\n', 'the North,\" it was repeatedly said, \"will not fight.\" As to disparity in\\n', 'numbers they drew historic parallels. \"Our fathers, a mere handful,\\n', 'overcame the enormous power of Great Britain,\" a saying of ex-President\\n', 'Tyler, ran current to reassure the doubtful. Finally, and this point\\n', 'cannot be too strongly emphasized, the South expected to see a weakened\\n', 'and divided North. It knew that the abolitionists and the Southern\\n', 'sympathizers were ready to let the Confederate states go in peace; that\\n', 'Lincoln represented only a little more than one-third the voters of the\\n', 'country; and that the vote for Douglas, Bell, and Breckinridge meant a\\n', 'decided opposition to the Republicans and their policies.\\n', '\\n', '=Efforts at Compromise.=--Republican leaders, on reviewing the same\\n', 'facts, were themselves uncertain as to the outcome of a civil war and\\n', 'made many efforts to avoid a crisis. Thurlow Weed, an Albany journalist\\n', 'and politician who had done much to carry New York for Lincoln, proposed\\n', 'a plan for extending the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific.\\n', 'Jefferson Davis, warning his followers that a war if it came would be\\n', 'terrible, was prepared to accept the offer; but Lincoln, remembering his\\n', 'campaign pledges, stood firm as a rock against it. His followers in\\n', 'Congress took the same position with regard to a similar settlement\\n', 'suggested by Senator Crittenden of Kentucky.\\n', '\\n', 'Though unwilling to surrender his solemn promises respecting slavery in\\n', 'the territories, Lincoln was prepared to give to Southern leaders a\\n', 'strong guarantee that his administration would not interfere directly or\\n', 'indirectly with slavery in the states. Anxious to reassure the South on\\n', 'this point, the Republicans in Congress proposed to write into the\\n', 'Constitution a declaration that no amendment should ever be made\\n', 'authorizing the abolition of or interference with slavery in any state.\\n', 'The resolution, duly passed, was sent forth on March 4, 1861, with the\\n', 'approval of Lincoln; it was actually ratified by three states before the\\n', 'storm of war destroyed it. By the irony of fate the thirteenth amendment\\n', 'was to abolish, not guarantee, slavery.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Raising the Armies.=--The crisis at Fort Sumter, on April 12-14, 1861,\\n', 'forced the President and Congress to turn from negotiations to problems\\n', 'of warfare. Little did they realize the magnitude of the task before\\n', \"them. Lincoln's first call for volunteers, issued on April 15, 1861,\\n\", 'limited the number to 75,000, put their term of service at three months,\\n', 'and prescribed their duty as the enforcement of the law against\\n', 'combinations too powerful to be overcome by ordinary judicial process.\\n', 'Disillusionment swiftly followed. The terrible defeat of the Federals at\\n', 'Bull Run on July 21 revealed the serious character of the task before\\n', 'them; and by a series of measures Congress put the entire man power of\\n', \"the country at the President's command. Under these acts, he issued new\\n\", 'calls for volunteers. Early in August, 1862, he ordered a draft of\\n', \"militiamen numbering 300,000 for nine months' service. The results were\\n\", 'disappointing--ominous--for only about 87,000 soldiers were added to the\\n', 'army. Something more drastic was clearly necessary.\\n', '\\n', 'In March, 1863, Lincoln signed the inevitable draft law; it enrolled in\\n', 'the national forces liable to military duty all able-bodied male\\n', 'citizens and persons of foreign birth who had declared their intention\\n', 'to become citizens, between the ages of twenty and forty-five\\n', 'years--with exemptions on grounds of physical weakness and dependency.\\n', 'From the men enrolled were drawn by lot those destined to active\\n', 'service. Unhappily the measure struck a mortal blow at the principle of\\n', 'universal liability by excusing any person who found a substitute for\\n', 'himself or paid into the war office a sum, not exceeding three hundred\\n', 'dollars, to be fixed by general order. This provision, so crass and so\\n', 'obviously favoring the well-to-do, sowed seeds of bitterness which\\n', 'sprang up a hundredfold in the North.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The beginning of the drawings under the draft act in New York City, on\\n', 'Monday, July 13, 1863, was the signal for four days of rioting. In the\\n', 'course of this uprising, draft headquarters were destroyed; the office\\n', 'of the _Tribune_ was gutted; negroes were seized, hanged, and shot; the\\n', 'homes of obnoxious Unionists were burned down; the residence of the\\n', 'mayor of the city was attacked; and regular battles were fought in the\\n', 'streets between the rioters and the police. Business stopped and a large\\n', 'part of the city passed absolutely into the control of the mob. Not\\n', 'until late the following Wednesday did enough troops arrive to restore\\n', 'order and enable the residents of the city to resume their daily\\n', 'activities. At least a thousand people had been killed or wounded and\\n', \"more than a million dollars' worth of damage done to property. The draft\\n\", 'temporarily interrupted by this outbreak was then resumed and carried\\n', 'out without further trouble.\\n', '\\n', 'The results of the draft were in the end distinctly disappointing to the\\n', 'government. The exemptions were numerous and the number who preferred\\n', 'and were able to pay $300 rather than serve exceeded all expectations.\\n', 'Volunteering, it is true, was stimulated, but even that resource could\\n', 'hardly keep the thinning ranks of the army filled. With reluctance\\n', 'Congress struck out the $300 exemption clause, but still favored the\\n', 'well-to-do by allowing them to hire substitutes if they could find them.\\n', 'With all this power in its hands the administration was able by January,\\n', '1865, to construct a union army that outnumbered the Confederates two to\\n', 'one.\\n', '\\n', '=War Finance.=--In the financial sphere the North faced immense\\n', 'difficulties. The surplus in the treasury had been dissipated by 1861\\n', 'and the tariff of 1857 had failed to produce an income sufficient to\\n', 'meet the ordinary expenses of the government. Confronted by military and\\n', 'naval expenditures of appalling magnitude, rising from $35,000,000 in\\n', 'the first year of the war to $1,153,000,000 in the last year, the\\n', 'administration had to tap every available source of income. The duties\\n', 'on imports were increased, not once but many times, producing huge\\n', 'revenues and also meeting the most extravagant demands of the\\n', 'manufacturers for protection. Direct taxes were imposed on the states\\n', 'according to their respective populations, but the returns were\\n', 'meager--all out of proportion to the irritation involved. Stamp taxes\\n', 'and taxes on luxuries, occupations, and the earnings of corporations\\n', 'were laid with a weight that, in ordinary times, would have drawn forth\\n', 'opposition of ominous strength. The whole gamut of taxation was run.\\n', 'Even a tax on incomes and gains by the year, the first in the history of\\n', 'the federal government, was included in the long list.\\n', '\\n', 'Revenues were supplemented by bond issues, mounting in size and interest\\n', 'rate, until in October, at the end of the war, the debt stood at\\n', '$2,208,000,000. The total cost of the war was many times the money value\\n', 'of all the slaves in the Southern states. To the debt must be added\\n', 'nearly half a billion dollars in \"greenbacks\"--paper money issued by\\n', 'Congress in desperation as bond sales and revenues from taxes failed to\\n', 'meet the rising expenditures. This currency issued at par on\\n', 'questionable warrant from the Constitution, like all such paper, quickly\\n', 'began to decline until in the worst fortunes of 1864 one dollar in gold\\n', 'was worth nearly three in greenbacks.\\n', '\\n', '=The Blockade of Southern Ports.=--Four days after his call for\\n', 'volunteers, April 19, 1861, President Lincoln issued a proclamation\\n', 'blockading the ports of the Southern Confederacy. Later the blockade was\\n', 'extended to Virginia and North Carolina, as they withdrew from the\\n', 'union. Vessels attempting to enter or leave these ports, if they\\n', 'disregarded the warnings of a blockading ship, were to be captured and\\n', 'brought as prizes to the nearest convenient port. To make the order\\n', 'effective, immediate steps were taken to increase the naval forces,\\n', 'depleted by neglect, until the entire coast line was patrolled with such\\n', 'a number of ships that it was a rare captain who ventured to run the\\n', 'gantlet. The collision between the _Merrimac_ and the _Monitor_ in\\n', 'March, 1862, sealed the fate of the Confederacy. The exploits of the\\n', 'union navy are recorded in the falling export of cotton: $202,000,000 in\\n', '1860; $42,000,000 in 1861; and $4,000,000 in 1862.\\n', '\\n', 'The deadly effect of this paralysis of trade upon Southern war power may\\n', 'be readily imagined. Foreign loans, payable in cotton, could be\\n', 'negotiated but not paid off. Supplies could be purchased on credit but\\n', 'not brought through the drag net. With extreme difficulty could the\\n', 'Confederate government secure even paper for the issue of money and\\n', 'bonds. Publishers, in despair at the loss of supplies, were finally\\n', 'driven to the use of brown wrapping paper and wall paper. As the\\n', 'railways and rolling stock wore out, it became impossible to renew them\\n', 'from England or France. Unable to export their cotton, planters on the\\n', 'seaboard burned it in what were called \"fires of patriotism.\" In their\\n', 'lurid light the fatal weakness of Southern economy stood revealed.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Diplomacy.=--The war had not advanced far before the federal government\\n', 'became involved in many perplexing problems of diplomacy in Europe. The\\n', 'Confederacy early turned to England and France for financial aid and for\\n', 'recognition as an independent power. Davis believed that the industrial\\n', 'crisis created by the cotton blockade would in time literally compel\\n', 'Europe to intervene in order to get this essential staple. The crisis\\n', 'came as he expected but not the result. Thousands of English textile\\n', 'workers were thrown out of employment; and yet, while on the point of\\n', 'starvation, they adopted resolutions favoring the North instead of\\n', 'petitioning their government to aid the South by breaking the blockade.\\n', '\\n', 'of the French, was eager to help in disrupting the American republic; if\\n', \"he could have won England's support, he would have carried out his\\n\", 'designs. As it turned out he found plenty of sympathy across the Channel\\n', 'but not open and official cooperation. According to the eminent\\n', 'historian, Rhodes, \"four-fifths of the British House of Lords and most\\n', 'members of the House of Commons were favorable to the Confederacy and\\n', 'anxious for its triumph.\" Late in 1862 the British ministers, thus\\n', 'sustained, were on the point of recognizing the independence of the\\n', 'Confederacy. Had it not been for their extreme caution, for the constant\\n', 'and harassing criticism by English friends of the United States--like\\n', 'John Bright--and for the victories of Vicksburg and Gettysburg, both\\n', '\\n', 'England and France would have doubtless declared the Confederacy to be\\n', 'one of the independent powers of the earth.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'While stopping short of recognizing its independence, England and France\\n', 'took several steps that were in favor of the South. In proclaiming\\n', 'neutrality, they early accepted the Confederates as \"belligerents\" and\\n', 'accorded them the rights of people at war--a measure which aroused anger\\n', 'in the North at first but was later admitted to be sound. Otherwise\\n', 'Confederates taken in battle would have been regarded as \"rebels\" or\\n', 'a coalition of powers against the North, only to meet a firm refusal.\\n', 'The next year he suggested intervention to Great Britain, encountering\\n', 'this time a conditional rejection of his plans. In 1863, not daunted by\\n', 'rebuffs, he offered his services to Lincoln as a mediator, receiving in\\n', 'reply a polite letter declining his proposal and a sharp resolution from\\n', 'Congress suggesting that he attend to his own affairs.\\n', '\\n', 'In both England and France the governments pursued a policy of\\n', 'friendliness to the Confederate agents. The British ministry, with\\n', 'indifference if not connivance, permitted rams and ships to be built in\\n', 'British docks and allowed them to escape to play havoc under the\\n', 'Confederate flag with American commerce. One of them, the _Alabama_,\\n', 'built in Liverpool by a British firm and paid for by bonds sold in\\n', 'England, ran an extraordinary career and threatened to break the\\n', 'blockade. The course followed by the British government, against the\\n', 'protests of the American minister in London, was later regretted. By an\\n', 'award of a tribunal of arbitration at Geneva in 1872, Great Britain was\\n', 'required to pay the huge sum of $15,500,000 to cover the damages wrought\\n', 'by Confederate cruisers fitted out in England.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'In all fairness it should be said that the conduct of the North\\n', 'contributed to the irritation between the two countries. Seward, the\\n', 'Secretary of State, was vindictive in dealing with Great Britain; had it\\n', 'not been for the moderation of Lincoln, he would have pursued a course\\n', 'verging in the direction of open war. The New York and Boston papers\\n', 'were severe in their attacks on England. Words were, on one occasion at\\n', 'least, accompanied by an act savoring of open hostility. In November,\\n', '1861, Captain Wilkes, commanding a union vessel, overhauled the British\\n', 'steamer _Trent_, and carried off by force two Confederate agents, Mason\\n', 'and Slidell, sent by President Davis to represent the Confederacy at\\n', 'London and Paris respectively. This was a clear violation of the right\\n', 'of merchant vessels to be immune from search and impressment; and, in\\n', 'answer to the demand of Great Britain for the release of the two men,\\n', 'the United States conceded that it was in the wrong. It surrendered the\\n', 'two Confederate agents to a British vessel for safe conduct abroad, and\\n', 'made appropriate apologies.\\n', '\\n', '=Emancipation.=--Among the extreme war measures adopted by the Northern\\n', 'government must be counted the emancipation of the slaves in the states\\n', 'in arms against the union. This step was early and repeatedly suggested\\n', 'to Lincoln by the abolitionists; but was steadily put aside. He knew\\n', 'that the abolitionists were a mere handful, that emancipation might\\n', 'drive the border states into secession, and that the Northern soldiers\\n', 'had enlisted to save the union. Moreover, he had before him a solemn\\n', 'resolution passed by Congress on July 22, 1861, declaring the sole\\n', 'purpose of the war to be the salvation of the union and disavowing any\\n', 'intention of interfering with slavery.\\n', '\\n', 'The federal government, though pledged to the preservation of slavery,\\n', 'soon found itself beaten back upon its course and out upon a new tack.\\n', 'Before a year had elapsed, namely on April 10, 1862, Congress resolved\\n', 'that financial aid should be given to any state that might adopt gradual\\n', 'emancipation. Six days later it abolished slavery in the District of\\n', 'Columbia. Two short months elapsed. On June 19, 1862, it swept slavery\\n', 'forever from the territories of the United States. Chief Justice Taney\\n', 'still lived, the Dred Scott decision stood as written in the book, but\\n', 'the Constitution had been re-read in the light of the Civil War. The\\n', 'drift of public sentiment in the North was being revealed.\\n', '\\n', 'While these measures were pending in Congress, Lincoln was slowly making\\n', 'up his mind. By July of that year he had come to his great decision.\\n', 'Near the end of that month he read to his cabinet the draft of a\\n', 'proclamation of emancipation; but he laid it aside until a military\\n', 'achievement would make it something more than an idle gesture. In\\n', 'September, the severe check administered to Lee at Antietam seemed to\\n', 'offer the golden opportunity. On the 22d, the immortal document was\\n', 'given to the world announcing that, unless the states in arms returned\\n', 'to the union by January 1, 1863, the fatal blow at their \"peculiar\\n', 'institution\" would be delivered. Southern leaders treated it with slight\\n', 'regard, and so on the date set the promise was fulfilled. The\\n', 'proclamation was issued as a war measure, adopted by the President as\\n', 'commander-in-chief of the armed forces, on grounds of military\\n', 'necessity. It did not abolish slavery. It simply emancipated slaves in\\n', 'places then in arms against federal authority. Everywhere else slavery,\\n', 'as far as the Proclamation was concerned, remained lawful.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'To seal forever the proclamation of emancipation, and to extend freedom\\n', 'to the whole country, Congress, in January, 1865, on the urgent\\n', 'recommendation of Lincoln, transmitted to the states the thirteenth\\n', 'amendment, abolishing slavery throughout the United States. By the end\\n', 'of 1865 the amendment was ratified. The house was not divided against\\n', 'itself; it did not fall; it was all free.\\n', '\\n', '=The Restraint of Civil Liberty.=--As in all great wars, particularly\\n', 'those in the nature of a civil strife, it was found necessary to use\\n', \"strong measures to sustain opinion favorable to the administration's\\n\", 'military policies and to frustrate the designs of those who sought to\\n', 'hamper its action. Within two weeks of his first call for volunteers,\\n', 'Lincoln empowered General Scott to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_\\n', 'along the line of march between Philadelphia and Washington and thus to\\n', 'arrest and hold without interference from civil courts any one whom he\\n', 'deemed a menace to the union. At a later date the area thus ruled by\\n', 'military officers was extended by executive proclamation. By an act of\\n', \"President's power, authorized him to suspend the writ throughout the\\n\", 'United States or in any part thereof. It also freed military officers\\n', 'from the necessity of surrendering to civil courts persons arrested\\n', 'under their orders, or even making answers to writs issued from such\\n', 'courts. In the autumn of that year the President, acting under the terms\\n', 'of this law, declared this ancient and honorable instrument for the\\n', 'protection of civil liberties, the _habeas corpus_, suspended throughout\\n', 'the length and breadth of the land. The power of the government was also\\n', 'strengthened by an act defining and punishing certain conspiracies,\\n', 'passed on July 31, 1861--a measure which imposed heavy penalties on\\n', 'those who by force, intimidation, or threat interfered with the\\n', 'execution of the law.\\n', '\\n', 'Thus doubly armed, the military authorities spared no one suspected of\\n', 'active sympathy with the Southern cause. Editors were arrested and\\n', 'imprisoned, their papers suspended, and their newsboys locked up. Those\\n', 'who organized \"peace meetings\" soon found themselves in the toils of the\\n', 'law. Members of the Maryland legislature, the mayor of Baltimore, and\\n', 'local editors suspected of entertaining secessionist opinions, were\\n', 'imprisoned on military orders although charged with no offense, and were\\n', 'farmer, too outspoken in his criticism of the government, found himself\\n', 'behind the bars until the government, in its good pleasure, saw fit to\\n', 'release him. These measures were not confined to the theater of war nor\\n', 'to the border states where the spirit of secession was strong enough to\\n', 'endanger the cause of union. They were applied all through the Northern\\n', 'states up to the very boundaries of Canada. Zeal for the national cause,\\n', 'too often supplemented by a zeal for persecution, spread terror among\\n', 'those who wavered in the singleness of their devotion to the union.\\n', '\\n', 'These drastic operations on the part of military authorities, so foreign\\n', 'to the normal course of civilized life, naturally aroused intense and\\n', 'bitter hostility. Meetings of protest were held throughout the country.\\n', 'Thirty-six members of the House of Representatives sought to put on\\n', 'record their condemnation of the suspension of the _habeas corpus_ act,\\n', 'only to meet a firm denial by the supporters of the act. Chief Justice\\n', \"Taney, before whom the case of a man arrested under the President's\\n\", 'military authority was brought, emphatically declared, in a long and\\n', 'learned opinion bristling with historical examples, that the President\\n', 'had no power to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_. In Congress and\\n', 'out, Democrats, abolitionists, and champions of civil liberty denounced\\n', 'Lincoln and his Cabinet in unsparing terms. Vallandigham, a Democratic\\n', 'leader of Ohio, afterward banished to the South for his opposition to\\n', 'the war, constantly applied to Lincoln the epithet of \"Caesar.\" Wendell\\n', 'Phillips saw in him \"a more unlimited despot than the world knows this\\n', 'side of China.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Sensitive to such stinging thrusts and no friend of wanton persecution,\\n', 'Lincoln attempted to mitigate the rigors of the law by paroling many\\n', 'political prisoners. The general policy, however, he defended in homely\\n', 'language, very different in tone and meaning from the involved reasoning\\n', 'desert?\" he asked in a quiet way of some spokesmen for those who\\n', 'protested against arresting people for \"talking against the war.\" This\\n', 'summed up his philosophy. He was engaged in a war to save the union, and\\n', 'all measures necessary and proper to accomplish that purpose were\\n', 'warranted by the Constitution which he had sworn to uphold.\\n', '\\n', '=Military Strategy--North and South.=--The broad outlines of military\\n', 'strategy followed by the commanders of the opposing forces are clear\\n', 'even to the layman who cannot be expected to master the details of a\\n', 'campaign or, for that matter, the maneuvers of a single great battle.\\n', 'The problem for the South was one of defense mainly, though even for\\n', 'defense swift and paralyzing strokes at the North were later deemed\\n', 'imperative measures. The problem of the North was, to put it baldly, one\\n', 'of invasion and conquest. Southern territory had to be invaded and\\n', 'Southern armies beaten on their own ground or worn down to exhaustion\\n', 'there.\\n', '\\n', 'In the execution of this undertaking, geography, as usual, played a\\n', 'significant part in the disposition of forces. The Appalachian ranges,\\n', 'stretching through the Confederacy to Northern Alabama, divided the\\n', 'campaigns into Eastern and Western enterprises. Both were of signal\\n', 'importance. Victory in the East promised the capture of the Confederate\\n', 'capital of Richmond, a stroke of moral worth, hardly to be\\n', 'overestimated. Victory in the West meant severing the Confederacy and\\n', 'opening the Mississippi Valley down to the Gulf.\\n', '\\n', 'As it turned out, the Western forces accomplished their task first,\\n', 'vindicating the military powers of union soldiers and shaking the\\n', 'confidence of opposing commanders. In February, 1862, Grant captured\\n', 'Fort Donelson on the Tennessee River, rallied wavering unionists in\\n', 'Kentucky, forced the evacuation of Nashville, and opened the way for two\\n', 'hundred miles into the Confederacy. At Shiloh, Murfreesboro, Vicksburg,\\n', 'Chickamauga, Chattanooga, desperate fighting followed and, in spite of\\n', 'varying fortunes, it resulted in the discomfiture and retirement of\\n', 'Confederate forces to the Southeast into Georgia. By the middle of 1863,\\n', 'the Mississippi Valley was open to the Gulf, the initiative taken out of\\n', 'the hands of Southern commanders in the West, and the way prepared for\\n', \"Sherman's final stroke--the march from Atlanta to the sea--a maneuver\\n\", 'executed with needless severity in the autumn of 1864.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'For the almost unbroken succession of achievements in the West by\\n', 'Generals Grant, Sherman, Thomas, and Hooker against Albert Sidney\\n', 'Johnston, Bragg, Pemberton, and Hood, the union forces in the East\\n', 'offered at first an almost equally unbroken series of misfortunes and\\n', 'disasters. Far from capturing Richmond, they had been thrown on the\\n', 'defensive. General after general--McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, and\\n', 'Meade--was tried and found wanting. None of them could administer a\\n', 'crushing defeat to the Confederate troops and more than once the union\\n', 'soldiers were beaten in a fair battle. They did succeed, however, in\\n', 'delivering a severe check to advancing Confederates under General Robert\\n', 'July, 1863--checks reckoned as victories though in each instance the\\n', 'Confederates escaped without demoralization. Not until the beginning of\\n', 'the next year, when General Grant, supplied with almost unlimited men\\n', \"and munitions, began his irresistible hammering at Lee's army, did the\\n\", 'final phase of the war commence. The pitiless drive told at last.\\n', 'General Lee, on April 9, 1865, seeing the futility of further conflict,\\n', 'surrendered an army still capable of hard fighting, at Appomattox, not\\n', 'far from the capital of the Confederacy.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Abraham Lincoln.=--The services of Lincoln to the cause of union defy\\n', 'planning in every part of the varied activity that finally crowned\\n', 'Northern arms with victory. Is it in the field of diplomacy? Does\\n', 'Seward, the Secretary of State, propose harsh and caustic measures\\n', \"likely to draw England's sword into the scale? Lincoln counsels\\n\", 'moderation. He takes the irritating message and with his own hand\\n', 'strikes out, erases, tones down, and interlines, exchanging for words\\n', 'that sting and burn the language of prudence and caution. Is it a matter\\n', 'of compromise with the South, so often proposed by men on both sides\\n', 'sick of carnage? Lincoln is always ready to listen and turns away only\\n', 'when he is invited to surrender principles essential to the safety of\\n', 'the union. Is it high strategy of war, a question of the general best\\n', 'fitted to win Gettysburg--Hooker, Sedgwick, or Meade? Lincoln goes in\\n', 'person to the War Department in the dead of night to take counsel with\\n', 'his Secretary and to make the fateful choice.\\n', '\\n', 'Is it a complaint from a citizen, deprived, as he believes, of his civil\\n', 'liberties unjustly or in violation of the Constitution? Lincoln is ready\\n', 'to hear it and anxious to afford relief, if warrant can be found for it.\\n', 'Is a mother begging for the life of a son sentenced to be shot as a\\n', 'deserter? Lincoln hears her petition, and grants it even against the\\n', 'protests made by his generals in the name of military discipline. Do\\n', 'politicians sow dissensions in the army and among civilians? Lincoln\\n', 'grandly waves aside their petty personalities and invites them to think\\n', 'of the greater cause. Is it a question of securing votes to ratify the\\n', 'thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery? Lincoln thinks it not beneath\\n', 'his dignity to traffic and huckster with politicians over the trifling\\n', 'jobs asked in return by the members who hold out against him. Does a New\\n', \"York newspaper call him an ignorant Western boor? Lincoln's reply is a\\n\", 'letter to a mother who has given her all--her sons on the field of\\n', 'battle--and an address at Gettysburg, both of which will live as long as\\n', 'the tongue in which they were written. These are tributes not only to\\n', 'his mastery of the English language but also to his mastery of all those\\n', 'sentiments of sweetness and strength which are the finest flowers of\\n', 'culture.\\n', '\\n', 'Throughout the entire span of service, however, Lincoln was beset by\\n', 'merciless critics. The fiery apostles of abolition accused him of\\n', 'cowardice when he delayed the bold stroke at slavery. Anti-war Democrats\\n', 'lashed out at every step he took. Even in his own party he found no\\n', 'peace. Charles Sumner complained: \"Our President is now dictator,\\n', '_imperator_--whichever you like; but how vain to have the power of a\\n', 'god and not to use it godlike.\" Leaders among the Republicans sought to\\n', 'have a worse man,\" was Lincoln\\'s quiet answer.\\n', '\\n', 'Wide were the dissensions in the North during that year and the\\n', 'Republicans, while selecting Lincoln as their candidate again, cast off\\n', 'their old name and chose the simple title of the \"Union party.\"\\n', 'Moreover, they selected a Southern man, Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, to\\n', 'be associated with him as candidate for Vice President. This combination\\n', 'the Northern Democrats boldly confronted with a platform declaring that\\n', '\"after four years of failure to restore the union by the experiment of\\n', 'war, during which, under the pretence of military necessity or war power\\n', 'higher than the Constitution, the Constitution itself has been\\n', 'disregarded in every part and public liberty and private right alike\\n', 'trodden down ... justice, humanity, liberty, and public welfare demand\\n', 'that immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities, to the\\n', 'end that peace may be restored on the basis of the federal union of the\\n', 'states.\" It is true that the Democratic candidate, General McClellan,\\n', 'sought to break the yoke imposed upon him by the platform, saying that\\n', 'he could not look his old comrades in the face and pronounce their\\n', 'efforts vain; but the party call to the nation to repudiate Lincoln and\\n', 'his works had gone forth. The response came, giving Lincoln 2,200,000\\n', 'votes against 1,800,000 for his opponent. The bitter things said about\\n', 'him during the campaign, he forgot and forgave. When in April, 1865, he\\n', \"was struck down by the assassin's hand, he above all others in\\n\", 'Washington was planning measures of moderation and healing.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'There is a strong and natural tendency on the part of writers to stress\\n', 'the dramatic and heroic aspects of war; but the long judgment of history\\n', 'requires us to include all other significant phases as well. Like every\\n', 'great armed conflict, the Civil War outran the purposes of those who\\n', 'took part in it. Waged over the nature of the union, it made a\\n', 'revolution in the union, changing public policies and constitutional\\n', 'principles and giving a new direction to agriculture and industry.\\n', '\\n', '=The Supremacy of the Union.=--First and foremost, the war settled for\\n', 'all time the long dispute as to the nature of the federal system. The\\n', 'doctrine of state sovereignty was laid to rest. Men might still speak of\\n', 'the rights of states and think of their commonwealths with affection,\\n', 'but nullification and secession were destroyed. The nation was supreme.\\n', '\\n', '=The Destruction of the Slave Power.=--Next to the vindication of\\n', 'national supremacy was the destruction of the planting aristocracy of\\n', 'the South--that great power which had furnished leadership of undoubted\\n', 'ability and had so long contested with the industrial and commercial\\n', 'interests of the North. The first paralyzing blow at the planters was\\n', 'struck by the abolition of slavery. The second and third came with the\\n', 'fourteenth (1868) and fifteenth (1870) amendments, giving the ballot to\\n', 'freedmen and excluding from public office the Confederate\\n', 'leaders--driving from the work of reconstruction the finest talents of\\n', 'the South. As if to add bitterness to gall and wormwood, the fourteenth\\n', 'amendment forbade the United States or any state to pay any debts\\n', 'incurred in aid of the Confederacy or in the emancipation of the\\n', 'slaves--plunging into utter bankruptcy the Southern financiers who had\\n', 'stripped their section of capital to support their cause. So the\\n', 'Southern planters found themselves excluded from public office and ruled\\n', 'over by their former bondmen under the tutelage of Republican leaders.\\n', 'Their labor system was wrecked and their money and bonds were as\\n', 'worthless as waste paper. The South was subject to the North. That which\\n', 'neither the Federalists nor the Whigs had been able to accomplish in the\\n', 'realm of statecraft was accomplished on the field of battle.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Triumph of Industry.=--The wreck of the planting system was\\n', 'accompanied by a mighty upswing of Northern industry which made the old\\n', 'Whigs of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania stare in wonderment. The demands\\n', 'of the federal government for manufactured goods at unrestricted prices\\n', 'gave a stimulus to business which more than replaced the lost markets of\\n', 'the South. Between 1860 and 1870 the number of manufacturing\\n', 'decade; while the number of persons employed almost doubled. There was\\n', 'no doubt about the future of American industry.\\n', '\\n', '=The Victory for the Protective Tariff.=--Moreover, it was henceforth to\\n', 'be well protected. For many years before the war the friends of\\n', 'protection had been on the defensive. The tariff act of 1857 imposed\\n', 'duties so low as to presage a tariff for revenue only. The war changed\\n', 'all that. The extraordinary military expenditures, requiring heavy taxes\\n', 'on all sources, justified tariffs so high that a follower of Clay or\\n', 'Webster might well have gasped with astonishment. After the war was over\\n', 'the debt remained and both interest and principal had to be paid.\\n', 'Protective arguments based on economic reasoning were supported by a\\n', 'plain necessity for revenue which admitted no dispute.\\n', '\\n', 'supply. The problem of manning industries became a pressing matter, and\\n', 'Republican leaders grappled with it. In the platform of the Union party\\n', 'adopted in 1864 it was declared \"that foreign immigration, which in the\\n', 'past has added so much to the wealth, the development of resources, and\\n', 'the increase of power to this nation--the asylum of the oppressed of all\\n', 'nations--should be fostered and encouraged by a liberal and just\\n', 'policy.\" In that very year Congress, recognizing the importance of the\\n', 'problem, passed a measure of high significance, creating a bureau of\\n', 'immigration, and authorizing a modified form of indentured labor, by\\n', 'making it legal for immigrants to pledge their wages in advance to pay\\n', 'their passage over. Though the bill was soon repealed, the practice\\n', 'authorized by it was long continued. The cheapness of the passage\\n', 'shortened the term of service; but the principle was older than the\\n', 'days of William Penn.\\n', '\\n', '=The Homestead Act of 1862.=--In the immigration measure guaranteeing a\\n', 'continuous and adequate labor supply, the manufacturers saw an offset to\\n', 'the Homestead Act of 1862 granting free lands to settlers. The Homestead\\n', 'law they had resisted in a long and bitter congressional battle.\\n', 'Naturally, they had not taken kindly to a scheme which lured men away\\n', 'from the factories or enabled them to make unlimited demands for higher\\n', 'wages as the price of remaining. Southern planters likewise had feared\\n', 'free homesteads for the very good reason that they only promised to add\\n', 'to the overbalancing power of the North.\\n', '\\n', 'In spite of the opposition, supporters of a liberal land policy made\\n', 'steady gains. Free-soil Democrats,--Jacksonian farmers and\\n', 'Douglas of Illinois and Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, kept up the\\n', 'agitation in season and out. More than once were they able to force a\\n', 'homestead bill through the House of Representatives only to have it\\n', 'blocked in the Senate where Southern interests were intrenched. Then,\\n', 'after the Senate was won over, a Democratic President, James Buchanan,\\n', 'vetoed the bill. Still the issue lived. The Republicans, strong among\\n', 'the farmers of the Northwest, favored it from the beginning and pressed\\n', 'it upon the attention of the country. Finally the manufacturers yielded;\\n', 'they received their compensation in the contract labor law. In 1862\\n', 'Congress provided for the free distribution of land in 160-acre lots\\n', 'among men and women of strong arms and willing hearts ready to build\\n', 'their serried lines of homesteads to the Rockies and beyond.\\n', '\\n', '=Internal Improvements.=--If farmers and manufacturers were early\\n', 'divided on the matter of free homesteads, the same could hardly be said\\n', 'of internal improvements. The Western tiller of the soil was as eager\\n', 'for some easy way of sending his produce to market as the manufacturer\\n', 'was for the same means to transport his goods to the consumer on the\\n', 'farm. While the Confederate leaders were writing into their\\n', 'constitution a clause forbidding all appropriations for internal\\n', 'improvements, the Republican leaders at Washington were planning such\\n', 'expenditures from the treasury in the form of public land grants to\\n', 'railways as would have dazed the authors of the national road bill half\\n', 'a century earlier.\\n', '\\n', \"=Sound Finance--National Banking.=--From Hamilton's day to Lincoln's,\\n\", 'business men in the East had contended for a sound system of national\\n', 'currency. The experience of the states with paper money, painfully\\n', 'impressive in the years before the framing of the Constitution, had been\\n', 'convincing to those who understood the economy of business. The\\n', 'Constitution, as we have seen, bore the signs of this experience. States\\n', 'were forbidden to emit bills of credit: paper money, in short. This\\n', 'provision stood clear in the document; but judicial ingenuity had\\n', 'circumvented it in the age of Jacksonian Democracy. The states had\\n', 'enacted and the Supreme Court, after the death of John Marshall, had\\n', 'sustained laws chartering banking companies and authorizing them to\\n', 'issue paper money. So the country was beset by the old curse, the banks\\n', 'of Western and Southern states issuing reams of paper notes to help\\n', 'borrowers pay their debts.\\n', '\\n', 'In dealing with war finances, the Republicans attacked this ancient\\n', 'evil. By act of Congress in 1864, they authorized a series of national\\n', 'banks founded on the credit of government bonds and empowered to issue\\n', 'notes. The next year they stopped all bank paper sent forth under the\\n', 'authority of the states by means of a prohibitive tax. In this way, by\\n', 'two measures Congress restored federal control over the monetary system\\n', 'although it did not reestablish the United States Bank so hated by\\n', 'Jacksonian Democracy.\\n', '\\n', \"=Destruction of States' Rights by Fourteenth Amendment.=--These acts and\\n\", 'others not cited here were measures of centralization and consolidation\\n', 'at the expense of the powers and dignity of the states. They were all of\\n', 'high import, but the crowning act of nationalism was the fourteenth\\n', 'amendment which, among other things, forbade states to \"deprive any\\n', 'person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\" The\\n', 'immediate occasion, though not the actual cause of this provision, was\\n', 'the need for protecting the rights of freedmen against hostile\\n', 'legislatures in the South. The result of the amendment, as was\\n', 'prophesied in protests loud and long from every quarter of the\\n', 'Democratic party, was the subjection of every act of state, municipal,\\n', 'and county authorities to possible annulment by the Supreme Court at\\n', 'Washington. The expected happened.\\n', '\\n', 'Few negroes ever brought cases under the fourteenth amendment to the\\n', 'attention of the courts; but thousands of state laws, municipal\\n', 'ordinances, and acts of local authorities were set aside as null and\\n', 'void under it. Laws of states regulating railway rates, fixing hours of\\n', 'labor in bakeshops, and taxing corporations were in due time to be\\n', 'annulled as conflicting with an amendment erroneously supposed to be\\n', 'designed solely for the protection of negroes. As centralized power over\\n', 'tariffs, railways, public lands, and other national concerns went to\\n', 'Congress, so centralized power over the acts of state and local\\n', 'authorities involving an infringement of personal and property rights\\n', 'was conferred on the federal judiciary, the apex of which was the\\n', 'Supreme Court at Washington. Thus the old federation of \"independent\\n', 'states,\" all equal in rights and dignity, each wearing the \"jewel of\\n', 'sovereignty\" so celebrated in Southern oratory, had gone the way of all\\n', 'flesh under the withering blasts of Civil War.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Theories about the Position of the Seceded States.=--On the morning of\\n', 'April 9, 1865, when General Lee surrendered his army to General Grant,\\n', 'eleven states stood in a peculiar relation to the union now declared\\n', 'perpetual. Lawyers and political philosophers were much perturbed and\\n', 'had been for some time as to what should be done with the members of the\\n', 'former Confederacy. Radical Republicans held that they were \"conquered\\n', 'provinces\" at the mercy of Congress, to be governed under such laws as\\n', 'it saw fit to enact and until in its wisdom it decided to readmit any or\\n', 'all of them to the union. Men of more conservative views held that, as\\n', 'the war had been waged by the North on the theory that no state could\\n', 'secede from the union, the Confederate states had merely attempted to\\n', 'withdraw and had failed. The corollary of this latter line of argument\\n', 'was simple: \"The Southern states are still in the union and it is the\\n', 'duty of the President, as commander-in-chief, to remove the federal\\n', 'troops as soon as order is restored and the state governments ready to\\n', 'function once more as usual.\"\\n', '\\n', \"=Lincoln's Proposal.=--Some such simple and conservative form of\\n\", 'reconstruction had been suggested by Lincoln in a proclamation of\\n', 'December 8, 1863. He proposed pardon and a restoration of property,\\n', 'except in slaves, to nearly all who had \"directly or by implication\\n', 'participated in the existing rebellion,\" on condition that they take an\\n', 'oath of loyalty to the union. He then announced that when, in any of the\\n', 'states named, a body of voters, qualified under the law as it stood\\n', 'before secession and equal in number to one-tenth the votes cast in\\n', '1860, took the oath of allegiance, they should be permitted to\\n', 'reestablish a state government. Such a government, he added, should be\\n', 'recognized as a lawful authority and entitled to protection under the\\n', 'federal Constitution. With reference to the status of the former slaves\\n', 'Lincoln made it clear that, while their freedom must be recognized, he\\n', 'would not object to any legislation \"which may yet be consistent as a\\n', 'temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring,\\n', 'landless, and homeless class.\"\\n', '\\n', \"=Andrew Johnson's Plan--His Impeachment.=--Lincoln's successor, Andrew\\n\", 'Johnson, the Vice President, soon after taking office, proposed to\\n', 'pursue a somewhat similar course. In a number of states he appointed\\n', 'military governors, instructing them at the earliest possible moment to\\n', 'assemble conventions, chosen \"by that portion of the people of the said\\n', 'states who are loyal to the United States,\" and proceed to the\\n', 'organization of regular civil government. Johnson, a Southern man and a\\n', 'Democrat, was immediately charged by the Republicans with being too\\n', 'ready to restore the Southern states. As the months went by, the\\n', 'opposition to his measures and policies in Congress grew in size and\\n', 'bitterness. The contest resulted in the impeachment of Johnson by the\\n', 'House of Representatives in March, 1868, and his acquittal by the Senate\\n', 'merely because his opponents lacked one vote of the two-thirds required\\n', 'for conviction.\\n', '\\n', '=Congress Enacts \"Reconstruction Laws.\"=--In fact, Congress was in a\\n', 'strategic position. It was the law-making body, and it could, moreover,\\n', 'determine the conditions under which Senators and Representatives from\\n', 'the South were to be readmitted. It therefore proceeded to pass a series\\n', \"of reconstruction acts--carrying all of them over Johnson's veto. These\\n\", 'measures, the first of which became a law on March 2, 1867, betrayed an\\n', \"animus not found anywhere in Lincoln's plans or Johnson's proclamations.\\n\", '\\n', 'They laid off the ten states--the whole Confederacy with the exception\\n', 'of Tennessee--still outside the pale, into five military districts, each\\n', 'commanded by a military officer appointed by the President. They ordered\\n', 'the commanding general to prepare a register of voters for the election\\n', 'of delegates to conventions chosen for the purpose of drafting new\\n', 'constitutions. Such voters, however, were not to be, as Lincoln had\\n', 'suggested, loyal persons duly qualified under the law existing before\\n', 'secession but \"the male citizens of said state, twenty-one years old and\\n', 'upward, of whatever race, color, or previous condition, ... except such\\n', 'as may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion or for felony\\n', 'at common law.\" This was the death knell to the idea that the leaders of\\n', 'the Confederacy and their white supporters might be permitted to share\\n', 'in the establishment of the new order. Power was thus arbitrarily thrust\\n', 'into the hands of the newly emancipated male negroes and the handful of\\n', 'whites who could show a record of loyalty. That was not all. Each state\\n', 'was, under the reconstruction acts, compelled to ratify the fourteenth\\n', 'amendment to the federal Constitution as a price of restoration to the\\n', 'union.\\n', '\\n', 'The composition of the conventions thus authorized may be imagined.\\n', 'Bondmen without the asking and without preparation found themselves the\\n', 'governing power. An army of adventurers from the North, \"carpet baggers\"\\n', 'as they were called, poured in upon the scene to aid in\\n', '\"reconstruction.\" Undoubtedly many men of honor and fine intentions gave\\n', 'unstinted service, but the results of their deliberations only\\n', 'aggravated the open wound left by the war. Any number of political\\n', 'doctors offered their prescriptions; but no effective remedy could be\\n', 'found. Under measures admittedly open to grave objections, the Southern\\n', 'states were one after another restored to the union by the grace of\\n', 'Congress, the last one in 1870. Even this grudging concession of the\\n', 'formalities of statehood did not mean a full restoration of honors and\\n', 'privileges. The last soldier was not withdrawn from the last Southern\\n', 'capital until 1877, and federal control over elections long remained as\\n', 'a sign of congressional supremacy.\\n', '\\n', '=The Status of the Freedmen.=--Even more intricate than the issues\\n', 'involved in restoring the seceded states to the union was the question\\n', 'of what to do with the newly emancipated slaves. That problem, often put\\n', 'to abolitionists before the war, had become at last a real concern. The\\n', 'thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery had not touched it at all. It\\n', 'declared bondmen free, but did nothing to provide them with work or\\n', 'homes and did not mention the subject of political rights. All these\\n', 'matters were left to the states, and the legislatures of some of them,\\n', 'by their famous \"black codes,\" restored a form of servitude under the\\n', 'guise of vagrancy and apprentice laws. Such methods were in fact partly\\n', \"responsible for the reaction that led Congress to abandon Lincoln's\\n\", 'policies and undertake its own program of reconstruction.\\n', '\\n', 'Still no extensive effort was made to solve by law the economic problems\\n', 'of the bondmen. Radical abolitionists had advocated that the slaves when\\n', 'emancipated should be given outright the fields of their former\\n', 'masters; but Congress steadily rejected the very idea of confiscation.\\n', 'The necessity of immediate assistance it recognized by creating in 1865\\n', \"the Freedmen's Bureau to take care of refugees. It authorized the issue\\n\", 'of food and clothing to the destitute and the renting of abandoned and\\n', 'certain other lands under federal control to former slaves at reasonable\\n', 'rates. But the larger problem of the relation of the freedmen to the\\n', 'land, it left to the slow working of time.\\n', '\\n', 'Against sharp protests from conservative men, particularly among the\\n', 'Democrats, Congress did insist, however, on conferring upon the freedmen\\n', 'certain rights by national law. These rights fell into broad divisions,\\n', 'civil and political. By an act passed in 1866, Congress gave to former\\n', 'slaves the rights of white citizens in the matter of making contracts,\\n', 'giving testimony in courts, and purchasing, selling, and leasing\\n', 'property. As it was doubtful whether Congress had the power to enact\\n', 'this law, there was passed and submitted to the states the fourteenth\\n', 'amendment which gave citizenship to the freedmen, assured them of the\\n', 'privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, and declared\\n', 'that no state should deprive any person of his life, liberty, or\\n', 'property without due process of law. Not yet satisfied, Congress\\n', 'attempted to give social equality to negroes by the second civil rights\\n', 'bill of 1875 which promised to them, among other things, the full and\\n', 'equal enjoyment of inns, theaters, public conveyances, and places of\\n', 'amusement--a law later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\\n', '\\n', 'The matter of political rights was even more hotly contested; but the\\n', 'radical Republicans, like Charles Sumner, asserted that civil rights\\n', 'were not secure unless supported by the suffrage. In this same\\n', 'fourteenth amendment they attempted to guarantee the ballot to all negro\\n', 'men, leaving the women to take care of themselves. The amendment\\n', 'declared in effect that when any state deprived adult male citizens of\\n', 'the right to vote, its representation in Congress should be reduced in\\n', 'the proportion such persons bore to the voting population.\\n', '\\n', 'This provision having failed to accomplish its purpose, the fifteenth\\n', 'amendment was passed and ratified, expressly declaring that no citizen\\n', 'should be deprived of the right to vote \"on account of race, color, or\\n', 'previous condition of servitude.\" To make assurance doubly secure,\\n', 'Congress enacted in 1870, 1872, and 1873 three drastic laws, sometimes\\n', 'known as \"force bills,\" providing for the use of federal authorities,\\n', 'civil and military, in supervising elections in all parts of the Union.\\n', 'So the federal government, having destroyed chattel slavery, sought by\\n', 'legal decree to sweep away all its signs and badges, civil, social, and\\n', 'political. Never, save perhaps in some of the civil conflicts of Greece\\n', 'or Rome, had there occurred in the affairs of a nation a social\\n', 'revolution so complete, so drastic, and far-reaching in its results.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Just as the United States, under the impetus of Western enterprise,\\n', 'rounded out the continental domain, its very existence as a nation was\\n', 'challenged by a fratricidal conflict between two sections. This storm\\n', 'had been long gathering upon the horizon. From the very beginning in\\n', 'colonial times there had been a marked difference between the South and\\n', 'the North. The former by climate and soil was dedicated to a planting\\n', 'system--the cultivation of tobacco, rice, cotton, and sugar cane--and in\\n', 'the course of time slave labor became the foundation of the system. The\\n', 'North, on the other hand, supplemented agriculture by commerce, trade,\\n', 'and manufacturing. Slavery, though lawful, did not flourish there. An\\n', 'abundant supply of free labor kept the Northern wheels turning.\\n', '\\n', 'This difference between the two sections, early noted by close\\n', 'observers, was increased with the advent of the steam engine and the\\n', 'factory system. Between 1815 and 1860 an industrial revolution took\\n', 'place in the North. Its signs were gigantic factories, huge aggregations\\n', 'of industrial workers, immense cities, a flourishing commerce, and\\n', 'prosperous banks. Finding an unfavorable reception in the South, the new\\n', 'industrial system was confined mainly to the North. By canals and\\n', 'railways New York, Boston, and Philadelphia were linked with the\\n', 'diverted from New Orleans to the East and Eastern credit sustained\\n', 'Western enterprise.\\n', '\\n', 'In time, the industrial North and the planting South evolved different\\n', 'ideas of political policy. The former looked with favor on protective\\n', 'tariffs, ship subsidies, a sound national banking system, and internal\\n', 'improvements. The farmers of the West demanded that the public domain be\\n', 'divided up into free homesteads for farmers. The South steadily swung\\n', 'around to the opposite view. Its spokesmen came to regard most of these\\n', 'policies as injurious to the planting interests.\\n', '\\n', 'The economic questions were all involved in a moral issue. The Northern\\n', 'states, in which slavery was of slight consequence, had early abolished\\n', 'the institution. In the course of a few years there appeared\\n', 'uncompromising advocates of universal emancipation. Far and wide the\\n', 'agitation spread. The South was thoroughly frightened. It demanded\\n', 'protection against the agitators, the enforcement of its rights in the\\n', 'case of runaway slaves, and equal privileges for slavery in the new\\n', 'territories.\\n', '\\n', 'With the passing years the conflict between the two sections increased\\n', 'in bitterness. It flamed up in 1820 and was allayed by the Missouri\\n', 'compromise. It took on the form of a tariff controversy and\\n', 'nullification in 1832. It appeared again after the Mexican war when the\\n', 'question of slavery in the new territories was raised. Again\\n', 'compromise--the great settlement of 1850--seemed to restore peace, only\\n', 'into war: the repeal of the Missouri compromise in 1854, the rise of the\\n', 'Republican party pledged to the prohibition of slavery in the\\n', 'territories, the Dred Scott decision of 1857, the Lincoln-Douglas\\n', \"debates, John Brown's raid, the election of Lincoln, and secession.\\n\", '\\n', 'The Civil War, lasting for four years, tested the strength of both North\\n', 'and South, in leadership, in finance, in diplomatic skill, in material\\n', 'resources, in industry, and in armed forces. By the blockade of Southern\\n', 'ports, by an overwhelming weight of men and materials, and by relentless\\n', 'hammering on the field of battle, the North was victorious.\\n', '\\n', 'The results of the war were revolutionary in character. Slavery was\\n', 'abolished and the freedmen given the ballot. The Southern planters who\\n', 'had been the leaders of their section were ruined financially and almost\\n', 'to a man excluded from taking part in political affairs. The union was\\n', 'declared to be perpetual and the right of a state to secede settled by\\n', 'the judgment of battle. Federal control over the affairs of states,\\n', 'counties, and cities was established by the fourteenth amendment. The\\n', 'power and prestige of the federal government were enhanced beyond\\n', 'imagination. The North was now free to pursue its economic policies: a\\n', 'protective tariff, a national banking system, land grants for railways,\\n', 'free lands for farmers.

The ruling class, the law, and the government of the old\\n', 'order had been subverted. To political chaos was added the havoc wrought\\n', 'in agriculture, business, and transportation by military operations. And\\n', 'as if to fill the cup to the brim, the task of reconstruction was\\n', 'committed to political leaders from another section of the country,\\n', 'strangers to the life and traditions of the South.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'been the striking feature of the old regime, so their ruin was the\\n', 'outstanding fact of the new. The situation was extraordinary. The\\n', 'American Revolution was carried out by people experienced in the arts of\\n', 'self-government, and at its close they were free to follow the general\\n', 'course to which they had long been accustomed. The French Revolution\\n', 'witnessed the overthrow of the clergy and the nobility; but middle\\n', 'classes who took their places had been steadily rising in intelligence\\n', 'and wealth.\\n', '\\n', 'The Southern Revolution was unlike either of these cataclysms. It was\\n', 'not brought about by a social upheaval, but by an external crisis. It\\n', 'did not enfranchise a class that sought and understood power, but\\n', 'bondmen who had played no part in the struggle. Moreover it struck down\\n', 'a class equipped to rule. The leading planters were almost to a man\\n', 'excluded from state and federal offices, and the fourteenth amendment\\n', 'was a bar to their return. All civil and military places under the\\n', 'authority of the United States and of the states were closed to every\\n', 'man who had taken an oath to support the Constitution as a member of\\n', 'Congress, as a state legislator, or as a state or federal officer, and\\n', 'afterward engaged in \"insurrection or rebellion,\" or \"given aid and\\n', 'comfort to the enemies\" of the United States. This sweeping provision,\\n', 'supplemented by the reconstruction acts, laid under the ban most of the\\n', 'talent, energy, and spirit of the South.\\n', '\\n', '=The Condition of the State Governments.=--The legislative, executive,\\n', 'and judicial branches of the state governments thus passed into the\\n', 'control of former slaves, led principally by Northern adventurers or\\n', 'Southern novices, known as \"Scalawags.\" The result was a carnival of\\n', 'waste, folly, and corruption. The \"reconstruction\" assembly of South\\n', 'Carolina bought clocks at $480 apiece and chandeliers at $650. To\\n', 'purchase land for former bondmen the sum of $800,000 was appropriated;\\n', 'and swamps bought at seventy-five cents an acre were sold to the state\\n', 'at five times the cost. In the years between 1868 and 1873, the debt of\\n', 'the state rose from about $5,800,000 to $24,000,000, and millions of the\\n', 'increase could not be accounted for by the authorities responsible for\\n', 'it.\\n', '\\n', '=Economic Ruin--Urban and Rural.=--No matter where Southern men turned\\n', 'in 1865 they found devastation--in the towns, in the country, and along\\n', 'the highways. Atlanta, the city to which Sherman applied the torch, lay\\n', 'in ashes; Nashville and Chattanooga had been partially wrecked; Richmond\\n', 'and Augusta had suffered severely from fires. Charleston was described\\n', 'by a visitor as \"a city of ruins, of desolation, of vacant houses, of\\n', 'rotten wharves, of deserted warehouses, of weed gardens, of miles of\\n', 'grass-grown streets.... How few young men there are, how generally the\\n', 'young women are dressed in black! The flower of their proud aristocracy\\n', 'is buried on scores of battle fields.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Those who journeyed through the country about the same time reported\\n', 'desolation equally widespread and equally pathetic. An English traveler\\n', 'who made his way along the course of the Tennessee River in 1870 wrote:\\n', '\"The trail of war is visible throughout the valley in burnt-up gin\\n', 'houses, ruined bridges, mills, and factories ... and large tracts of\\n', 'once cultivated land are stripped of every vestige of fencing. The\\n', 'roads, long neglected, are in disorder and, having in many places become\\n', 'impassable, new tracks have been made through the woods and fields\\n', 'without much respect to boundaries.\" Many a great plantation had been\\n', 'confiscated by the federal authorities while the owner was in\\n', 'Confederate service. Many more lay in waste. In the wake of the armies\\n', 'the homes of rich and poor alike, if spared the torch, had been\\n', 'despoiled of the stock and seeds necessary to renew agriculture.\\n', '\\n', '=Railways Dilapidated.=--Transportation was still more demoralized. This\\n', 'is revealed in the pages of congressional reports based upon first-hand\\n', 'investigations. One eloquent passage illustrates all the rest. From\\n', 'Pocahontas to Decatur, Alabama, a distance of 114 miles, we are told,\\n', 'the railroad was \"almost entirely destroyed, except the road bed and\\n', 'iron rails, and they were in a very bad condition--every bridge and\\n', 'trestle destroyed, cross-ties rotten, buildings burned, water tanks\\n', 'gone, tracks grown up in weeds and bushes, not a saw mill near the line\\n', 'and the labor system of the country gone. About forty miles of the track\\n', 'were burned, the cross-ties entirely destroyed, and the rails bent and\\n', 'twisted in such a manner as to require great labor to straighten and a\\n', 'large portion of them requiring renewal.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Capital and Credit Destroyed.=--The fluid capital of the South, money\\n', 'and credit, was in the same prostrate condition as the material capital.\\n', 'The Confederate currency, inflated to the bursting point, had utterly\\n', 'collapsed and was as worthless as waste paper. The bonds of the\\n', 'Confederate government were equally valueless. Specie had nearly\\n', 'disappeared from circulation. The fourteenth amendment to the federal\\n', 'Constitution had made all \"debts, obligations, and claims\" incurred in\\n', 'aid of the Confederate cause \"illegal and void.\" Millions of dollars\\n', 'owed to Northern creditors before the war were overdue and payment was\\n', 'pressed upon the debtors. Where such debts were secured by mortgages on\\n', 'land, executions against the property could be obtained in federal\\n', 'courts.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Intimidation.=--In both politics and economics, the process of\\n', 'reconstruction in the South was slow and arduous. The first battle in\\n', 'the political contest for white supremacy was won outside the halls of\\n', 'legislatures and the courts of law. It was waged, in the main, by secret\\n', 'organizations, among which the Ku Klux Klan and the White Camelia were\\n', 'the most prominent. The first of these societies appeared in Tennessee\\n', 'in 1866 and held its first national convention the following year. It\\n', 'was in origin a social club. According to its announcement, its objects\\n', 'were \"to protect the weak, the innocent, and the defenceless from the\\n', 'indignities, wrongs, and outrages of the lawless, the violent, and the\\n', 'brutal; and to succor the suffering, especially the widows and orphans\\n', 'of the Confederate soldiers.\" The whole South was called \"the Empire\"\\n', 'and was ruled by a \"Grand Wizard.\" Each state was a realm and each\\n', 'county a province. In the secret orders there were enrolled over half a\\n', 'million men.\\n', '\\n', 'The methods of the Ku Klux and the White Camelia were similar. Solemn\\n', 'parades of masked men on horses decked in long robes were held,\\n', 'sometimes in the daytime and sometimes at the dead of night. Notices\\n', 'were sent to obnoxious persons warning them to stop certain practices.\\n', 'If warning failed, something more convincing was tried. Fright was the\\n', 'midnight, would ride up to the house of some offender, lift his head\\n', 'gear, take off a skull, and hand it to the trembling victim with the\\n', 'request that he hold it for a few minutes. Frequently violence was\\n', 'employed either officially or unofficially by members of the Klan. Tar\\n', 'and feathers were freely applied; the whip was sometimes laid on\\n', 'unmercifully, and occasionally a brutal murder was committed. Often the\\n', 'members were fired upon from bushes or behind trees, and swift\\n', 'retaliation followed. So alarming did the clashes become that in 1870\\n', 'Congress forbade interference with electors or going in disguise for the\\n', 'purpose of obstructing the exercise of the rights enjoyed under federal\\n', 'law.\\n', '\\n', 'In anticipation of such a step on the part of the federal government,\\n', 'the Ku Klux was officially dissolved by the \"Grand Wizard\" in 1869.\\n', 'Nevertheless, the local societies continued their organization and\\n', 'methods. The spirit survived the national association. \"On the whole,\"\\n', 'says a Southern writer, \"it is not easy to see what other course was\\n', 'open to the South.... Armed resistance was out of the question. And yet\\n', 'there must be some control had of the situation.... If force was denied,\\n', 'craft was inevitable.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Struggle for the Ballot Box.=--The effects of intimidation were\\n', 'soon seen at elections. The freedman, into whose inexperienced hand the\\n', 'ballot had been thrust, was ordinarily loath to risk his head by the\\n', 'exercise of his new rights. He had not attained them by a long and\\n', 'laborious contest of his own and he saw no urgent reason why he should\\n', 'battle for the privilege of using them. The mere show of force, the mere\\n', 'existence of a threat, deterred thousands of ex-slaves from appearing at\\n', 'the polls. Thus the whites steadily recovered their dominance. Nothing\\n', 'could prevent it. Congress enacted force bills establishing federal\\n', 'supervision of elections and the Northern politicians protested against\\n', 'the return of former Confederates to practical, if not official, power;\\n', 'but all such opposition was like resistance to the course of nature.\\n', '\\n', '=Amnesty for Southerners.=--The recovery of white supremacy in this way\\n', 'was quickly felt in national councils. The Democratic party in the North\\n', 'welcomed it as a sign of its return to power. The more moderate\\n', 'Republicans, anxious to heal the breach in American unity, sought to\\n', 'encourage rather than to repress it. So it came about that amnesty for\\n', 'Confederates was widely advocated. Yet it must be said that the struggle\\n', 'for the removal of disabilities was stubborn and bitter. Lincoln, with\\n', 'characteristic generosity, in the midst of the war had issued a general\\n', 'proclamation of amnesty to nearly all who had been in arms against the\\n', 'Union, on condition that they take an oath of loyalty; but Johnson,\\n', 'vindictive toward Southern leaders and determined to make \"treason\\n', 'infamous,\" had extended the list of exceptions. Congress, even more\\n', 'relentless in its pursuit of Confederates, pushed through the fourteenth\\n', 'amendment which worked the sweeping disabilities we have just described.\\n', '\\n', 'To appeals for comprehensive clemency, Congress was at first adamant. In\\n', 'vain did men like Carl Schurz exhort their colleagues to crown their\\n', 'victory in battle with a noble act of universal pardon and oblivion.\\n', 'Congress would not yield. It would grant amnesty in individual cases;\\n', 'for the principle of proscription it stood fast. When finally in 1872,\\n', 'seven years after the surrender at Appomattox, it did pass the general\\n', 'amnesty bill, it insisted on certain exceptions. Confederates who had\\n', 'been members of Congress just before the war, or had served in other\\n', 'high posts, civil or military, under the federal government, were still\\n', 'excluded from important offices. Not until the summer of 1898, when the\\n', 'war with Spain produced once more a union of hearts, did Congress relent\\n', 'and abolish the last of the disabilities imposed on the Confederates.\\n', '\\n', '=The Force Bills Attacked and Nullified.=--The granting of amnesty\\n', 'encouraged the Democrats to redouble their efforts all along the line.\\n', 'In 1874 they captured the House of Representatives and declared war on\\n', 'the \"force bills.\" As a Republican Senate blocked immediate repeal, they\\n', 'resorted to an ingenious parliamentary trick. To the appropriation bill\\n', 'for the support of the army they attached a \"rider,\" or condition, to\\n', 'the effect that no troops should be used to sustain the Republican\\n', 'ensued and Congress adjourned without making provision for the army.\\n', 'Satisfied with the technical victory, the Democrats let the army bill\\n', 'pass the next session, but kept up their fight on the force laws until\\n', 'they wrung from President Hayes a measure forbidding the use of United\\n', 'States troops in supervising elections. The following year they again\\n', 'had recourse to a rider on the army bill and carried it through, putting\\n', 'an end to the use of money for military control of elections. The\\n', 'reconstruction program was clearly going to pieces, and the Supreme\\n', 'Court helped along the process of dissolution by declaring parts of the\\n', 'laws invalid. In 1878 the Democrats even won a majority in the Senate\\n', 'and returned to power a large number of men once prominent in the\\n', 'Confederate cause.\\n', '\\n', 'generation of men was coming on the scene. The supremacy of the whites\\n', 'in the South, if not yet complete, was at least assured. Federal\\n', 'marshals, their deputies, and supervisors of elections still possessed\\n', 'authority over the polls, but their strength had been shorn by the\\n', 'withdrawal of United States troops. The war on the remaining remnants of\\n', 'the \"force bills\" lapsed into desultory skirmishing. When in 1894 the\\n', 'last fragment was swept away, the country took little note of the fact.\\n', 'The only task that lay before the Southern leaders was to write in the\\n', 'constitutions of their respective states the provisions of law which\\n', 'would clinch the gains so far secured and establish white supremacy\\n', 'beyond the reach of outside intervention.\\n', '\\n', '=White Supremacy Sealed by New State Constitutions.=--The impetus to\\n', 'this final step was given by the rise of the Populist movement in the\\n', 'South, which sharply divided the whites and in many communities threw\\n', 'the balance of power into the hands of the few colored voters who\\n', 'survived the process of intimidation. Southern leaders now devised new\\n', 'constitutions so constructed as to deprive negroes of the ballot by law.\\n', 'Mississippi took the lead in 1890; South Carolina followed five years\\n', 'later; Louisiana, in 1898; North Carolina, in 1900; Alabama and\\n', 'Maryland, in 1901; and Virginia, in 1902.\\n', '\\n', 'The authors of these measures made no attempt to conceal their purposes.\\n', '\"The intelligent white men of the South,\" said Governor Tillman, \"intend\\n', 'to govern here.\" The fifteenth amendment to the federal Constitution,\\n', 'however, forbade them to deprive any citizen of the right to vote on\\n', 'account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This made\\n', 'necessary the devices of indirection. They were few, simple, and\\n', 'effective. The first and most easily administered was the ingenious\\n', 'provision requiring each prospective voter to read a section of the\\n', 'state constitution or \"understand and explain it\" when read to him by\\n', 'the election officers. As an alternative, the payment of taxes or the\\n', 'ownership of a small amount of property was accepted as a qualification\\n', 'for voting. Southern leaders, unwilling to disfranchise any of the poor\\n', 'white men who had stood side by side with them \"in the dark days of\\n', 'reconstruction,\" also resorted to a famous provision known as \"the\\n', 'grandfather clause.\" This plan admitted to the suffrage any man who did\\n', 'not have either property or educational qualifications, provided he had\\n', 'voted on or before 1867 or was the son or grandson of any such person.\\n', '\\n', 'The devices worked effectively. Of the 147,000 negroes in Mississippi\\n', 'above the age of twenty-one, only about 8600 registered under the\\n', 'constitution of 1890. Louisiana had 127,000 colored voters enrolled in\\n', '1896; under the constitution drafted two years later the registration\\n', 'fell to 5300. An analysis of the figures for South Carolina in 1900\\n', 'indicates that only about one negro out of every hundred adult males of\\n', 'that race took part in elections. Thus was closed this chapter of\\n', 'reconstruction.\\n', '\\n', '=The Supreme Court Refuses to Intervene.=--Numerous efforts were made to\\n', 'prevail upon the Supreme Court of the United States to declare such laws\\n', 'unconstitutional; but the Court, usually on technical grounds, avoided\\n', 'coming to a direct decision on the merits of the matter. In one case\\n', 'the Court remarked that it could not take charge of and operate the\\n', 'election machinery of Alabama; it concluded that \"relief from a great\\n', 'political wrong, if done as alleged, by the people of a state and by the\\n', 'state itself, must be given by them, or by the legislative and executive\\n', 'departments of the government of the United States.\" Only one of the\\n', 'several schemes employed, namely, the \"grandfather clause,\" was held to\\n', 'be a violation of the federal Constitution. This blow, effected in 1915\\n', 'by the decision in the Oklahoma and Maryland cases, left, however, the\\n', 'main structure of disfranchisement unimpaired.\\n', '\\n', '=Proposals to Reduce Southern Representation in Congress.=--These\\n', 'provisions excluding thousands of male citizens from the ballot did not,\\n', 'in express terms, deprive any one of the vote on account of race or\\n', 'color. They did not, therefore, run counter to the letter of the\\n', 'fifteenth amendment; but they did unquestionably make the states which\\n', 'adopted them liable to the operations of the fourteenth amendment. The\\n', 'latter very explicitly provides that whenever any state deprives adult\\n', 'male citizens of the right to vote (except in certain minor cases) the\\n', 'representation of the state in Congress shall be reduced in the\\n', 'proportion which such number of disfranchised citizens bears to the\\n', 'whole number of male citizens over twenty-one years of age.\\n', '\\n', 'Mindful of this provision, those who protested against disfranchisement\\n', 'in the South turned to the Republican party for relief, asking for\\n', 'action by the political branches of the federal government as the\\n', 'Supreme Court had suggested. The Republicans responded in their platform\\n', 'of 1908 by condemning all devices designed to deprive any one of the\\n', 'ballot for reasons of color alone; they demanded the enforcement in\\n', 'letter and spirit of the fourteenth as well as all other amendments.\\n', 'Though victorious in the election, the Republicans refrained from\\n', 'reopening the ancient contest; they made no attempt to reduce Southern\\n', 'representation in the House. Southern leaders, while protesting against\\n', 'the declarations of their opponents, were able to view them as idle\\n', 'threats in no way endangering the security of the measures by which\\n', 'political reconstruction had been undone.\\n', '\\n', '=The Solid South.=--Out of the thirty-year conflict against \"carpet-bag\\n', 'rule\" there emerged what was long known as the \"solid South\"--a South\\n', 'that, except occasionally in the border states, never gave an electoral\\n', 'vote to a Republican candidate for President. Before the Civil War, the\\n', 'Southern people had been divided on political questions. Take, for\\n', 'example, the election of 1860. In all the fifteen slave states the\\n', 'variety of opinion was marked. In nine of them--Delaware, Virginia,\\n', 'Tennessee, Missouri, Maryland, Louisiana, Kentucky, Georgia, and\\n', 'Arkansas--the combined vote against the representative of the extreme\\n', 'Southern point of view, Breckinridge, constituted a safe majority. In\\n', 'each of the six states which were carried by Breckinridge, there was a\\n', \"large and powerful minority. In North Carolina Breckinridge's majority\\n\", 'over Bell and Douglas was only 849 votes. Equally astounding to those\\n', 'who imagine the South united in defense of extreme views in 1860 was the\\n', 'vote for Bell, the Unionist candidate, who stood firmly for the\\n', \"Constitution and silence on slavery. In every Southern state Bell's vote\\n\", 'was large. In Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee it was greater\\n', 'than that received by Breckinridge; in Georgia, it was 42,000 against\\n', '51,000; in Louisiana, 20,000 against 22,000; in Mississippi, 25,000\\n', 'against 40,000.\\n', '\\n', 'The effect of the Civil War upon these divisions was immediate and\\n', 'decisive, save in the border states where thousands of men continued to\\n', 'adhere to the cause of Union. In the Confederacy itself nearly all\\n', 'dissent was silenced by war. Men who had been bitter opponents joined\\n', 'hands in defense of their homes; when the armed conflict was over they\\n', 'remained side by side working against \"Republican misrule and negro\\n', 'domination.\" By 1890, after Northern supremacy was definitely broken,\\n', 'they boasted that there were at least twelve Southern states in which no\\n', 'Republican candidate for President could win a single electoral vote.\\n', '\\n', '=Dissent in the Solid South.=--Though every one grew accustomed to speak\\n', 'of the South as \"solid,\" it did not escape close observers that in a\\n', 'number of Southern states there appeared from time to time a fairly\\n', 'large body of dissenters. In 1892 the Populists made heavy inroads upon\\n', 'the Democratic ranks. On other occasions, the contests between factions\\n', 'within the Democratic party over the nomination of candidates revealed\\n', 'sharp differences of opinion. In some places, moreover, there grew up a\\n', 'Republican minority of respectable size. For example, in Georgia, Mr.\\n', 'Taft in 1908 polled 41,000 votes against 72,000 for Mr. Bryan; in North\\n', 'Carolina, 114,000 against 136,000; in Tennessee, 118,000 against\\n', '135,000; in Kentucky, 235,000 against 244,000. In 1920, Senator Harding,\\n', 'the Republican candidate, broke the record by carrying Tennessee as well\\n', 'as Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Maryland.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Break-up of the Great Estates.=--In the dissolution of chattel\\n', 'slavery it was inevitable that the great estate should give way before\\n', 'the small farm. The plantation was in fact founded on slavery. It was\\n', 'continued and expanded by slavery. Before the war the prosperous\\n', 'planter, either by inclination or necessity, invested his surplus in\\n', 'more land to add to his original domain. As his slaves increased in\\n', 'number, he was forced to increase his acreage or sell them, and he\\n', 'usually preferred the former, especially in the Far South. Still another\\n', 'element favored the large estate. Slave labor quickly exhausted the soil\\n', 'and of its own force compelled the cutting of the forests and the\\n', 'extension of the area under cultivation. Finally, the planter took a\\n', 'natural pride in his great estate; it was a sign of his prowess and his\\n', 'social prestige.\\n', '\\n', 'In 1865 the foundations of the planting system were gone. It was\\n', 'difficult to get efficient labor to till the vast plantations. The\\n', 'planters themselves were burdened with debts and handicapped by lack of\\n', 'capital. Negroes commonly preferred tilling plots of their own, rented\\n', 'or bought under mortgage, to the more irksome wage labor under white\\n', 'supervision. The land hunger of the white farmer, once checked by the\\n', 'planting system, reasserted itself. Before these forces the plantation\\n', 'broke up. The small farm became the unit of cultivation in the South as\\n', 'in the North. Between 1870 and 1900 the number of farms doubled in every\\n', 'state south of the line of the Potomac and Ohio rivers, except in\\n', 'Arkansas and Louisiana. From year to year the process of breaking up\\n', 'continued, with all that it implied in the creation of land-owning\\n', 'farmers.\\n', '\\n', '=The Diversification of Crops.=--No less significant was the concurrent\\n', 'diversification of crops. Under slavery, tobacco, rice, and sugar were\\n', 'staples and \"cotton was king.\" These were standard crops. The methods of\\n', 'cultivation were simple and easily learned. They tested neither the\\n', 'skill nor the ingenuity of the slaves. As the returns were quick, they\\n', 'did not call for long-time investments of capital. After slavery was\\n', 'abolished, they still remained the staples, but far-sighted\\n', 'agriculturists saw the dangers of depending upon a few crops. The mild\\n', 'climate all the way around the coast from Virginia to Texas and the\\n', 'character of the alluvial soil invited the exercise of more imagination.\\n', 'Peaches, oranges, peanuts, and other fruits and vegetables were found to\\n', 'grow luxuriantly. Refrigeration for steamships and freight cars put the\\n', 'markets of great cities at the doors of Southern fruit and vegetable\\n', 'gardeners. The South, which in planting days had relied so heavily upon\\n', 'the Northwest for its foodstuffs, began to battle for independence.\\n', 'Between 1880 and the close of the century the value of its farm crops\\n', 'increased from $660,000,000 to $1,270,000,000.\\n', '\\n', '=The Industrial and Commercial Revolution.=--On top of the radical\\n', 'changes in agriculture came an industrial and commercial revolution. The\\n', 'South had long been rich in natural resources, but the slave system had\\n', 'been unfavorable to their development. Rivers that would have turned\\n', 'millions of spindles tumbled unheeded to the seas. Coal and iron beds\\n', 'lay unopened. Timber was largely sacrificed in clearing lands for\\n', 'planting, or fell to earth in decay. Southern enterprise was consumed in\\n', 'planting. Slavery kept out the white immigrants who might have supplied\\n', 'the skilled labor for industry.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'After 1865, achievement and fortune no longer lay on the land alone. As\\n', 'soon as the paralysis of the war was over, the South caught the\\n', 'industrial spirit that had conquered feudal Europe and the agricultural\\n', 'North. In the development of mineral wealth, enormous strides were\\n', 'taken. Iron ore of every quality was found, the chief beds being in\\n', 'Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia,\\n', 'Alabama, Arkansas, and Texas. Five important coal basins were uncovered:\\n', 'in Virginia, North Carolina, the Appalachian chain from Maryland to\\n', 'Northern Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Texas. Oil pools were found\\n', 'in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas. Within two decades, 1880 to 1900, the\\n', 'output of mineral wealth multiplied tenfold: from ten millions a year to\\n', 'one hundred millions. The iron industries of West Virginia and Alabama\\n', 'began to rival those of Pennsylvania. Birmingham became the Pittsburgh\\n', 'and Atlanta the Chicago of the South.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'In other lines of industry, lumbering and cotton manufacturing took a\\n', 'high rank. The development of Southern timber resources was in every\\n', 'respect remarkable, particularly in Louisiana, Arkansas, and\\n', 'Mississippi. At the end of the first decade of the twentieth century,\\n', 'primacy in lumber had passed from the Great Lakes region to the South.\\n', 'In 1913 eight Southern states produced nearly four times as much lumber\\n', 'as the Lake states and twice as much as the vast forests of Washington\\n', 'and Oregon.\\n', '\\n', 'The development of the cotton industry, in the meantime, was similarly\\n', 'astounding. In 1865 cotton spinning was a negligible matter in the\\n', 'Southern states. In 1880 they had one-fourth of the mills of the\\n', 'country. At the end of the century they had one-half the mills, the two\\n', 'Carolinas taking the lead by consuming more than one-third of their\\n', 'entire cotton crop. Having both the raw materials and the power at hand,\\n', 'they enjoyed many advantages over the New England rivals, and at the\\n', 'opening of the new century were outstripping the latter in the\\n', 'proportion of spindles annually put into operation. Moreover, the cotton\\n', 'planters, finding a market at the neighboring mills, began to look\\n', 'forward to a day when they would be somewhat emancipated from absolute\\n', 'dependence upon the cotton exchanges of New York, New Orleans, and\\n', 'Liverpool.\\n', '\\n', 'Transportation kept pace with industry. In 1860, the South had about ten\\n', 'thousand miles of railway. By 1880 the figure had doubled. During the\\n', 'next twenty years over thirty thousand miles were added, most of the\\n', 'increase being in Texas. About 1898 there opened a period of\\n', 'consolidation in which scores of short lines were united, mainly under\\n', 'the leadership of Northern capitalists, and new through service opened\\n', 'to the North and West. Thus Southern industries were given easy outlets\\n', 'to the markets of the nation and brought within the main currents of\\n', 'national business enterprise.\\n', '\\n', '=The Social Effects of the Economic Changes.=--As long as the slave\\n', 'system lasted and planting was the major interest, the South was bound\\n', 'to be sectional in character. With slavery gone, crops diversified,\\n', 'natural resources developed, and industries promoted, the social order\\n', 'of the ante-bellum days inevitably dissolved; the South became more and\\n', 'more assimilated to the system of the North. In this process several\\n', 'lines of development are evident.\\n', '\\n', 'In the first place we see the steady rise of the small farmer. Even in\\n', 'the old days there had been a large class of white yeomen who owned no\\n', 'slaves and tilled the soil with their own hands, but they labored under\\n', 'severe handicaps. They found the fertile lands of the coast and river\\n', 'valleys nearly all monopolized by planters, and they were by the force\\n', 'of circumstances driven into the uplands where the soil was thin and the\\n', 'crops were light. Still they increased in numbers and zealously worked\\n', 'their freeholds.\\n', '\\n', 'The war proved to be their opportunity. With the break-up of the\\n', 'plantations, they managed to buy land more worthy of their plows. By\\n', 'intelligent labor and intensive cultivation they were able to restore\\n', 'much of the worn-out soil to its original fertility. In the meantime\\n', 'they rose with their prosperity in the social and political scale. It\\n', 'became common for the sons of white farmers to enter the professions,\\n', 'while their daughters went away to college and prepared for teaching.\\n', 'Thus a more democratic tone was given to the white society of the South.\\n', 'Moreover the migration to the North and West, which had formerly carried\\n', 'thousands of energetic sons and daughters to search for new homesteads,\\n', 'was materially reduced. The energy of the agricultural population went\\n', 'into rehabilitation.\\n', '\\n', 'The increase in the number of independent farmers was accompanied by the\\n', 'rise of small towns and villages which gave diversity to the life of the\\n', 'South. Before 1860 it was possible to travel through endless stretches\\n', \"of cotton and tobacco. The social affairs of the planter's family\\n\", 'centered in the homestead even if they were occasionally interrupted by\\n', 'trips to distant cities or abroad. Carpentry, bricklaying, and\\n', 'blacksmithing were usually done by slaves skilled in simple handicrafts.\\n', 'Supplies were bought wholesale. In this way there was little place in\\n', 'plantation economy for villages and towns with their stores and\\n', 'mechanics.\\n', '\\n', 'The abolition of slavery altered this. Small farms spread out where\\n', 'plantations had once stood. The skilled freedmen turned to agriculture\\n', 'rather than to handicrafts; white men of a business or mechanical bent\\n', 'found an opportunity to serve the needs of their communities. So local\\n', 'merchants and mechanics became an important element in the social\\n', 'system. In the county seats, once dominated by the planters, business\\n', 'and professional men assumed the leadership.\\n', '\\n', 'Another vital outcome of this revolution was the transference of a large\\n', 'part of planting enterprise to business. Mr. Bruce, a Southern historian\\n', 'of fine scholarship, has summed up this process in a single telling\\n', 'paragraph: \"The higher planting class that under the old system gave so\\n', 'much distinction to rural life has, so far as it has survived at all,\\n', 'been concentrated in the cities. The families that in the time of\\n', 'slavery would have been found only in the country are now found, with a\\n', 'few exceptions, in the towns. The transplantation has been practically\\n', 'universal. The talent, the energy, the ambition that formerly sought\\n', 'expression in the management of great estates and the control of hosts\\n', 'of slaves, now seek a field of action in trade, in manufacturing\\n', 'enterprises, or in the general enterprises of development. This was for\\n', 'the ruling class of the South the natural outcome of the great economic\\n', 'revolution that followed the war.\"\\n', '\\n', 'As in all other parts of the world, the mechanical revolution was\\n', 'attended by the growth of a population of industrial workers dependent\\n', 'not upon the soil but upon wages for their livelihood. When Jefferson\\n', 'Davis was inaugurated President of the Southern Confederacy, there were\\n', 'approximately only one hundred thousand persons employed in Southern\\n', 'manufactures as against more than a million in Northern mills. Fifty\\n', 'years later, Georgia and Alabama alone had more than one hundred and\\n', 'fifty thousand wage-earners. Necessarily this meant also a material\\n', 'increase in urban population, although the wide dispersion of cotton\\n', 'spinning among small centers prevented the congestion that had\\n', 'accompanied the rise of the textile industry in New England. In 1910,\\n', 'New Orleans, Atlanta, Memphis, Nashville, and Houston stood in the same\\n', 'relation to the New South that Cincinnati, Chicago, Cleveland, and\\n', 'Detroit had stood to the New West fifty years before. The problems of\\n', 'labor and capital and municipal administration, which the earlier\\n', 'writers boasted would never perplex the planting South, had come in full\\n', 'force.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Revolution in the Status of the Slaves.=--No part of Southern\\n', 'society was so profoundly affected by the Civil War and economic\\n', 'reconstruction as the former slaves. On the day of emancipation, they\\n', 'stood free, but empty-handed, the owners of no tools or property, the\\n', 'masters of no trade and wholly inexperienced in the arts of self-help\\n', 'that characterized the whites in general. They had never been accustomed\\n', 'to looking out for themselves. The plantation bell had called them to\\n', 'labor and released them. Doles of food and clothing had been regularly\\n', 'made in given quantities. They did not understand wages, ownership,\\n', 'renting, contracts, mortgages, leases, bills, or accounts.\\n', '\\n', 'When they were emancipated, four courses were open to them. They could\\n', 'flee from the plantation to the nearest town or city, or to the distant\\n', 'North, to seek a livelihood. Thousands of them chose this way,\\n', 'overcrowding cities where disease mowed them down. They could remain\\n', 'where they, were in their cabins and work for daily wages instead of\\n', 'food, clothing, and shelter. This second course the major portion of\\n', 'them chose; but, as few masters had cash to dispense, the new relation\\n', 'was much like the old, in fact. It was still one of barter. The planter\\n', 'offered food, clothing, and shelter; the former slaves gave their labor\\n', 'in return. That was the best that many of them could do.\\n', '\\n', 'master, paying him usually with a share of the produce of the land. This\\n', 'way a large number of them chose. It offered them a chance to become\\n', 'land owners in time and it afforded an easier life, the renter being, to\\n', 'a certain extent at least, master of his own hours of labor. The final\\n', 'and most difficult path was that to ownership of land. Many a master\\n', 'helped his former slaves to acquire small holdings by offering easy\\n', 'terms. The more enterprising and the more fortunate who started life as\\n', 'renters or wage-earners made their way upward to ownership in so many\\n', 'cases that by the end of the century, one-fourth of the colored laborers\\n', 'on the land owned the soil they tilled.\\n', '\\n', 'In the meantime, the South, though relatively poor, made relatively\\n', 'large expenditures for the education of the colored population. By the\\n', 'opening of the twentieth century, facilities were provided for more than\\n', 'one-half of the colored children of school age. While in many respects\\n', 'this progress was disappointing, its significance, to be appreciated,\\n', 'must be derived from a comparison with the total illiteracy which\\n', 'prevailed under slavery.\\n', '\\n', 'In spite of all that happened, however, the status of the negroes in the\\n', 'South continued to give a peculiar character to that section of the\\n', 'country. They were almost entirely excluded from the exercise of the\\n', 'suffrage, especially in the Far South. Special rooms were set aside for\\n', 'them at the railway stations and special cars on the railway lines. In\\n', 'the field of industry calling for technical skill, it appears, from the\\n', 'census figures, that they lost ground between 1890 and 1900--a condition\\n', 'which their friends ascribed to discriminations against them in law and\\n', 'in labor organizations and their critics ascribed to their lack of\\n', 'aptitude. Whatever may be the truth, the fact remained that at the\\n', 'opening of the twentieth century neither the hopes of the emancipators\\n', 'nor the fears of their opponents were realized. The marks of the\\n', '\"peculiar institution\" were still largely impressed upon Southern\\n', 'society.\\n', '\\n', 'The situation, however, was by no means unchanging. On the contrary\\n', 'there was a decided drift in affairs. For one thing, the proportion of\\n', 'negroes in the South had slowly declined. By 1900 they were in a\\n', 'majority in only two states, South Carolina and Mississippi. In\\n', 'Arkansas, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina the proportion of\\n', 'the white population was steadily growing. The colored migration\\n', 'northward increased while the westward movement of white farmers which\\n', 'characterized pioneer days declined. At the same time a part of the\\n', 'foreign immigration into the United States was diverted southward. As\\n', 'the years passed these tendencies gained momentum. The already huge\\n', 'colored quarters in some Northern cities were widely expanded, as whole\\n', 'counties in the South were stripped of their colored laborers. The race\\n', 'question, in its political and economic aspects, became less and less\\n', 'sectional, more and more national. The South was drawn into the main\\n', 'stream of national life. The separatist forces which produced the\\n', 'cataclysm of 1861 sank irresistibly into the background.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=References=\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Future of the Negro_.\\n', '\\n', 'Line_ (two works by Northern writers).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Questions=\\n', '\\n', '1.

The chief goal of this effort was high profits for the\\n', 'captains of industry, on the one hand; and high wages for the workers,\\n', 'on the other.

Statisticians attempt to record its\\n', 'achievements in terms of miles of railways built, factories opened, men\\n', 'and women employed, fortunes made, wages paid, cities founded, rivers\\n', 'spanned, boxes, bales, and tons produced. Historians apply standards of\\n', 'comparison with the past. Against the slow and leisurely stagecoach,\\n', 'they set the swift express, rushing from New York to San Francisco in\\n', 'less time than Washington consumed in his triumphal tour from Mt. Vernon\\n', 'to New York for his first inaugural. Against the lazy sailing vessel\\n', 'drifting before a genial breeze, they place the turbine steamer crossing\\n', 'the Atlantic in five days or the still swifter airplane, in fifteen\\n', 'hours. For the old workshop where a master and a dozen workmen and\\n', 'apprentices wrought by hand, they offer the giant factory where ten\\n', 'thousand persons attend the whirling wheels driven by steam. They write\\n', 'of the \"romance of invention\" and the \"captains of industry.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Service of the Railway.=--All this is fitting in its way. Figures\\n', 'and contrasts cannot, however, tell the whole story. Take, for example,\\n', 'the extension of railways. It is easy to relate that there were 30,000\\n', 'miles in 1860; 166,000 in 1890; and 242,000 in 1910. It is easy to show\\n', 'upon the map how a few straggling lines became a perfect mesh of closely\\n', 'knitted railways; or how, like the tentacles of a great monster, the few\\n', 'roads ending in the Mississippi Valley in 1860 were extended and\\n', 'multiplied until they tapped every wheat field, mine, and forest beyond\\n', 'the valley. All this, eloquent of enterprise as it truly is, does not\\n', 'reveal the significance of railways for American life. It does not\\n', 'indicate how railways made a continental market for American goods; nor\\n', 'how they standardized the whole country, giving to cities on the\\n', 'advancing frontier the leading features of cities in the old East; nor\\n', 'how they carried to the pioneer the comforts of civilization; nor yet\\n', 'how in the West they were the forerunners of civilization, the makers of\\n', 'homesteads, the builders of states.\\n', '\\n', '=Government Aid for Railways.=--Still the story is not ended. The\\n', 'significant relation between railways and politics must not be\\n', 'overlooked. The bounty of a lavish government, for example, made\\n', 'possible the work of railway promoters. By the year 1872 the Federal\\n', 'government had granted in aid of railways 155,000,000 acres of land--an\\n', 'area estimated as almost equal to Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut,\\n', 'Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The\\n', 'Union Pacific Company alone secured from the federal government a free\\n', 'right of way through the public domain, twenty sections of land with\\n', 'each mile of railway, and a loan up to fifty millions of dollars secured\\n', \"by a second mortgage on the company's property. More than half of the\\n\", 'northern tier of states lying against Canada from Lake Michigan to the\\n', 'Pacific was granted to private companies in aid of railways and wagon\\n', 'roads. About half of New Mexico, Arizona, and California was also given\\n', 'outright to railway companies. These vast grants from the federal\\n', 'government were supplemented by gifts from the states in land and by\\n', 'subscriptions amounting to more than two hundred million dollars. The\\n', 'history of these gifts and their relation to the political leaders that\\n', 'engineered them would alone fill a large and interesting volume.\\n', '\\n', '=Railway Fortunes and Capital.=--Out of this gigantic railway promotion,\\n', 'the first really immense American fortunes were made. Henry Adams, the\\n', 'grandson of John Quincy Adams, related that his grandfather on his\\n', \"mother's side, Peter Brooks, on his death in 1849, left a fortune of two\\n\", 'million dollars, \"supposed to be the largest estate in Boston,\" then one\\n', 'of the few centers of great riches. Compared with the opulence that\\n', 'sprang out of the Union Pacific, the Northern Pacific, the Southern\\n', 'Pacific, with their subsidiary and component lines, the estate of Peter\\n', \"Brooks was a poor man's heritage.\\n\", '\\n', 'The capital invested in these railways was enormous beyond the\\n', 'imagination of the men of the stagecoach generation. The total debt of\\n', 'the United States incurred in the Revolutionary War--a debt which those\\n', 'of little faith thought the country could never pay--was reckoned at a\\n', 'figure well under $75,000,000. When the Union Pacific Railroad was\\n', 'completed, there were outstanding against it $27,000,000 in first\\n', 'mortgage bonds, $27,000,000 in second mortgage bonds held by the\\n', 'government, $10,000,000 in income bonds, $10,000,000 in land grant\\n', 'bonds, and, on top of that huge bonded indebtedness, $36,000,000 in\\n', 'stock--making $110,000,000 in all. If the amount due the United States\\n', 'government be subtracted, still there remained, in private hands, stocks\\n', \"and bonds exceeding in value the whole national debt of Hamilton's\\n\", 'day--a debt that strained all the resources of the Federal government in\\n', '1790. Such was the financial significance of the railways.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Growth and Extension of Industry.=--In the field of manufacturing,\\n', 'mining, and metal working, the results of business enterprise far\\n', 'outstripped, if measured in mere dollars, the results of railway\\n', 'construction. By the end of the century there were about ten billion\\n', 'dollars invested in factories alone and five million wage-earners\\n', 'employed in them; while the total value of the output, fourteen billion\\n', 'dollars, was fifteen times the figure for 1860. In the Eastern states\\n', 'industries multiplied. In the Northwest territory, the old home of\\n', 'Jacksonian Democracy, they overtopped agriculture. By the end of the\\n', 'century, Ohio had almost reached and Illinois had surpassed\\n', 'Massachusetts in the annual value of manufacturing output.\\n', '\\n', 'That was not all. Untold wealth in the form of natural resources was\\n', 'discovered in the South and West. Coal deposits were found in the\\n', 'Appalachians stretching from Pennsylvania down to Alabama, in Michigan,\\n', 'in the Mississippi Valley, and in the Western mountains from North\\n', 'Dakota to New Mexico. In nearly every coal-bearing region, iron was also\\n', 'discovered and the great fields of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota\\n', 'soon rivaled those of the Appalachian area. Copper, lead, gold, and\\n', 'silver in fabulous quantities were unearthed by the restless prospectors\\n', 'who left no plain or mountain fastness unexplored. Petroleum, first\\n', 'pumped from the wells of Pennsylvania in the summer of 1859, made new\\n', 'fortunes equaling those of trade, railways, and land speculation. It\\n', 'scattered its riches with an especially lavish hand through Oklahoma,\\n', 'Texas, and California.\\n', '\\n', '=The Trust--an Instrument of Industrial Progress.=--Business enterprise,\\n', 'under the direction of powerful men working single-handed, or of small\\n', 'groups of men pooling their capital for one or more undertakings, had\\n', 'not advanced far before there appeared upon the scene still mightier\\n', 'leaders of even greater imagination. New constructive genius now brought\\n', 'together and combined under one management hundreds of concerns or\\n', 'thousands of miles of railways, revealing the magic strength of\\n', 'cooperation on a national scale. Price-cutting in oil, threatening ruin\\n', 'to those engaged in the industry, as early as 1879, led a number of\\n', 'companies in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia to unite in\\n', 'price-fixing. Three years later a group of oil interests formed a close\\n', 'organization, placing all their stocks in the hands of trustees, among\\n', 'certificates representing the share to which each participant was\\n', 'entitled; and took over the management of the entire business. Such was\\n', 'the nature of the \"trust,\" which was to play such an unique role in the\\n', 'progress of America.\\n', '\\n', 'The idea of combination was applied in time to iron and steel, copper,\\n', 'lead, sugar, cordage, coal, and other commodities, until in each field\\n', 'there loomed a giant trust or corporation, controlling, if not most of\\n', 'the output, at least enough to determine in a large measure the prices\\n', 'charged to consumers. With the passing years, the railways, mills,\\n', 'mines, and other business concerns were transferred from individual\\n', 'owners to corporations. At the end of the nineteenth century, the whole\\n', 'face of American business was changed. Three-fourths of the output from\\n', 'industries came from factories under corporate management and only\\n', 'one-fourth from individual and partnership undertakings.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Banking Corporation.=--Very closely related to the growth of\\n', 'business enterprise on a large scale was the system of banking. In the\\n', 'old days before banks, a person with savings either employed them in his\\n', 'own undertakings, lent them to a neighbor, or hid them away where they\\n', 'set no industry in motion. Even in the early stages of modern business,\\n', 'it was common for a manufacturer to rise from small beginnings by\\n', 'financing extensions out of his own earnings and profits. This state of\\n', 'affairs was profoundly altered by the growth of the huge corporations\\n', 'requiring millions and even billions of capital. The banks, once an\\n', 'adjunct to business, became the leaders in business.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'It was the banks that undertook to sell the stocks and bonds issued by\\n', 'new corporations and trusts and to supply them with credit to carry on\\n', 'their operations. Indeed, many of the great mergers or combinations in\\n', 'business were initiated by magnates in the banking world with millions\\n', 'and billions under their control. Through their connections with one\\n', 'another, the banks formed a perfect network of agencies gathering up the\\n', 'pennies and dollars of the masses as well as the thousands of the rich\\n', 'and pouring them all into the channels of business and manufacturing.\\n', 'In this growth of banking on a national scale, it was inevitable that a\\n', 'few great centers, like Wall Street in New York or State Street in\\n', 'Boston, should rise to a position of dominance both in concentrating the\\n', 'savings and profits of the nation and in financing new as well as old\\n', 'corporations.\\n', '\\n', '=The Significance of the Corporation.=--The corporation, in fact, became\\n', 'the striking feature of American business life, one of the most\\n', 'marvelous institutions of all time, comparable in wealth and power and\\n', 'the number of its servants with kingdoms and states of old. The effect\\n', 'of its rise and growth cannot be summarily estimated; but some special\\n', 'facts are obvious. It made possible gigantic enterprises once entirely\\n', 'beyond the reach of any individual, no matter how rich. It eliminated\\n', 'many of the futile and costly wastes of competition in connection with\\n', 'manufacture, advertising, and selling. It studied the cheapest methods\\n', 'of production and shut down mills that were poorly equipped or\\n', 'disadvantageously located. It established laboratories for research in\\n', 'industry, chemistry, and mechanical inventions. Through the sale of\\n', 'stocks and bonds, it enabled tens of thousands of people to become\\n', 'capitalists, if only in a small way. The corporation made it possible\\n', 'for one person to own, for instance, a $50 share in a million dollar\\n', 'business concern--a thing entirely impossible under a regime of\\n', 'individual owners and partnerships.\\n', '\\n', 'There was, of course, another side to the picture. Many of the\\n', 'corporations sought to become monopolies and to make profits, not by\\n', 'economies and good management, but by extortion from purchasers.\\n', 'Sometimes they mercilessly crushed small business men, their\\n', 'competitors, bribed members of legislatures to secure favorable laws,\\n', 'and contributed to the campaign funds of both leading parties. Wherever\\n', 'a trust approached the position of a monopoly, it acquired a dominion\\n', 'over the labor market which enabled it to break even the strongest trade\\n', 'unions. In short, the power of the trust in finance, in manufacturing,\\n', 'in politics, and in the field of labor control can hardly be measured.\\n', '\\n', '=The Corporation and Labor.=--In the development of the corporation\\n', 'there was to be observed a distinct severing of the old ties between\\n', 'master and workmen, which existed in the days of small industries. For\\n', 'the personal bond between the owner and the employees was substituted a\\n', 'new relation. \"In most parts of our country,\" as President Wilson once\\n', 'said, \"men work, not for themselves, not as partners in the old way in\\n', 'which they used to work, but generally as employees--in a higher or\\n', 'lower grade--of great corporations.\" The owner disappeared from the\\n', 'factory and in his place came the manager, representing the usually\\n', 'invisible stockholders and dependent for his success upon his ability to\\n', 'make profits for the owners. Hence the term \"soulless corporation,\"\\n', 'which was to exert such a deep influence on American thinking about\\n', 'industrial relations.\\n', '\\n', '=Cities and Immigration.=--Expressed in terms of human life, this era of\\n', 'unprecedented enterprise meant huge industrial cities and an immense\\n', 'labor supply, derived mainly from European immigration. Here, too,\\n', \"figures tell only a part of the story. In Washington's day nine-tenths\\n\", 'of the American people were engaged in agriculture and lived in the\\n', 'country; in 1890 more than one-third of the population dwelt in towns of\\n', '2500 and over; in 1920 more than half of the population lived in towns\\n', 'of over 2500. In forty years, between 1860 and 1900, Greater New York\\n', '342,000; Chicago from 109,000 to 1,698,000. The miles of city tenements\\n', 'began to rival, in the number of their residents, the farm homesteads of\\n', 'the West. The time so dreaded by Jefferson had arrived. People were\\n', '\"piled upon one another in great cities\" and the republic of small\\n', 'farmers had passed away.\\n', '\\n', 'To these industrial centers flowed annually an ever-increasing tide of\\n', 'immigration, reaching the half million point in 1880; rising to\\n', 'three-quarters of a million three years later; and passing the million\\n', 'mark in a single year at the opening of the new century. Immigration was\\n', 'as old as America but new elements now entered the situation. In the\\n', 'first place, there were radical changes in the nationality of the\\n', 'newcomers. The migration from Northern Europe--England, Ireland,\\n', 'Germany, and Scandinavia--diminished; that from Italy, Russia, and\\n', 'Austria-Hungary increased, more than three-fourths of the entire number\\n', 'coming from these three lands between the years 1900 and 1910. These\\n', 'later immigrants were Italians, Poles, Magyars, Czechs, Slovaks,\\n', 'Russians, and Jews, who came from countries far removed from the\\n', 'language and the traditions of England whence came the founders of\\n', 'America.\\n', '\\n', 'In the second place, the reception accorded the newcomers differed from\\n', 'that given to the immigrants in the early days. By 1890 all the free\\n', 'land was gone. They could not, therefore, be dispersed widely among the\\n', 'native Americans to assimilate quickly and unconsciously the habits and\\n', 'ideas of American life. On the contrary, they were diverted mainly to\\n', 'the industrial centers. There they crowded--nay, overcrowded--into\\n', 'colonies of their own where they preserved their languages, their\\n', 'newspapers, and their old-world customs and views.\\n', '\\n', 'So eager were American business men to get an enormous labor supply that\\n', 'they asked few questions about the effect of this \"alien invasion\" upon\\n', 'the old America inherited from the fathers. They even stimulated the\\n', 'invasion artificially by importing huge armies of foreigners under\\n', 'contract to work in specified mines and mills. There seemed to be no\\n', 'limit to the factories, forges, refineries, and railways that could be\\n', 'built, to the multitudes that could be employed in conquering a\\n', 'continent. As for the future, that was in the hands of Providence!\\n', '\\n', \"=Business Theories of Politics.=--As the statesmen of Hamilton's school\\n\", \"and the planters of Calhoun's had their theories of government and\\n\", 'politics, so the leaders in business enterprise had theirs. It was\\n', 'simple and easily stated. \"It is the duty of the government,\" they\\n', 'urged, \"to protect American industry against foreign competition by\\n', 'means of high tariffs on imported goods, to aid railways by generous\\n', 'grants of land, to sell mineral and timber lands at low prices to\\n', 'energetic men ready to develop them, and then to leave the rest to the\\n', 'initiative and drive of individuals and companies.\" All government\\n', 'interference with the management, prices, rates, charges, and conduct of\\n', 'private business they held to be either wholly pernicious or intolerably\\n', 'impertinent. Judging from their speeches and writings, they conceived\\n', 'the nation as a great collection of individuals, companies, and labor\\n', 'unions all struggling for profits or high wages and held together by a\\n', 'government whose principal duty was to keep the peace among them and\\n', 'protect industry against the foreign manufacturer. Such was the\\n', 'political theory of business during the generation that followed the\\n', 'Civil War.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Business Men and Republican Policies.=--Most of the leaders in industry\\n', 'gravitated to the Republican ranks. They worked in the North and the\\n', 'Republican party was essentially Northern. It was moreover--at least so\\n', 'far as the majority of its members were concerned--committed to\\n', 'protective tariffs, a sound monetary and banking system, the promotion\\n', 'of railways and industry by land grants, and the development of internal\\n', 'improvements. It was furthermore generous in its immigration policy. It\\n', 'proclaimed America to be an asylum for the oppressed of all countries\\n', 'and flung wide the doors for immigrants eager to fill the factories, man\\n', 'the mines, and settle upon Western lands. In a word the Republicans\\n', 'stood for all those specific measures which favored the enlargement and\\n', 'prosperity of business. At the same time they resisted government\\n', 'interference with private enterprise. They did not regulate railway\\n', 'rates, prosecute trusts for forming combinations, or prevent railway\\n', 'companies from giving lower rates to some shippers than to others. To\\n', 'sum it up, the political theories of the Republican party for three\\n', 'decades after the Civil War were the theories of American\\n', 'business--prosperous and profitable industries for the owners and \"the\\n', 'full dinner pail\" for the workmen. Naturally a large portion of those\\n', 'who flourished under its policies gave their support to it, voted for\\n', 'its candidates, and subscribed to its campaign funds.\\n', '\\n', '=Sources of Republican Strength in the North.=--The Republican party was\\n', 'in fact a political organization of singular power. It originated in a\\n', 'wave of moral enthusiasm, having attracted to itself, if not the\\n', 'abolitionists, certainly all those idealists, like James Russell Lowell\\n', 'and George William Curtis, who had opposed slavery when opposition was\\n', 'neither safe nor popular. To moral principles it added practical\\n', 'considerations. Business men had confidence in it. Workingmen, who\\n', 'longed for the independence of the farmer, owed to its indulgent land\\n', 'policy the opportunity of securing free homesteads in the West. The\\n', 'immigrant, landing penniless on these shores, as a result of the same\\n', 'beneficent system, often found himself in a little while with an estate\\n', 'as large as many a baronial domain in the Old World. Under a Republican\\n', 'administration, the union had been saved. To it the veterans of the war\\n', 'could turn with confidence for those rewards of service which the\\n', 'government could bestow: pensions surpassing in liberality anything that\\n', 'the world had ever seen. Under a Republican administration also the\\n', 'great debt had been created in the defense of the union, and to the\\n', 'Republican party every investor in government bonds could look for the\\n', 'full and honorable discharge of the interest and principal. The spoils\\n', 'system, inaugurated by Jacksonian Democracy, in turn placed all the\\n', 'federal offices in Republican hands, furnishing an army of party workers\\n', 'to be counted on for loyal service in every campaign.\\n', '\\n', 'Of all these things Republican leaders made full and vigorous use,\\n', 'sometimes ascribing to the party, in accordance with ancient political\\n', 'usage, merits and achievements not wholly its own. Particularly was this\\n', 'true in the case of saving the union. \"When in the economy of\\n', 'Providence, this land was to be purged of human slavery ... the\\n', 'Republican party came into power,\" ran a declaration in one platform.\\n', '\"The Republican party suppressed a gigantic rebellion, emancipated four\\n', 'million slaves, decreed the equal citizenship of all, and established\\n', 'universal suffrage,\" ran another. As for the aid rendered by the\\n', 'millions of Northern Democrats who stood by the union and the tens of\\n', 'thousands of them who actually fought in the union army, the Republicans\\n', 'in their zeal were inclined to be oblivious. They repeatedly charged the\\n', 'Democratic party \"with being the same in character and spirit as when it\\n', 'sympathized with treason.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Republican Control of the South.=--To the strength enjoyed in the\\n', 'North, the Republicans for a long time added the advantages that came\\n', 'from control over the former Confederate states where the newly\\n', 'enfranchised negroes, under white leadership, gave a grateful support to\\n', 'the party responsible for their freedom. In this branch of politics,\\n', 'motives were so mixed that no historian can hope to appraise them all at\\n', 'their proper values. On the one side of the ledger must be set the\\n', 'vigorous efforts of the honest and sincere friends of the freedmen to\\n', 'win for them complete civil and political equality, wiping out not only\\n', 'slavery but all its badges of misery and servitude. On the same side\\n', 'must be placed the labor of those who had valiantly fought in forum and\\n', 'field to save the union and who regarded continued Republican supremacy\\n', 'after the war as absolutely necessary to prevent the former leaders in\\n', 'secession from coming back to power. At the same time there were\\n', 'undoubtedly some men of the baser sort who looked on politics as a game\\n', 'and who made use of \"carpet-bagging\" in the South to win the spoils that\\n', 'might result from it. At all events, both by laws and presidential acts,\\n', 'the Republicans for many years kept a keen eye upon the maintenance of\\n', 'their dominion in the South. Their declaration that neither the law nor\\n', 'its administration should admit any discrimination in respect of\\n', 'citizens by reason of race, color, or previous condition of servitude\\n', 'appealed to idealists and brought results in elections. Even South\\n', '1872 by a vote of three to one!\\n', '\\n', 'Republican control was made easy by the force bills described in a\\n', 'previous chapter--measures which vested the supervision of elections in\\n', 'federal officers appointed by Republican Presidents. These drastic\\n', 'measures, departing from American tradition, the Republican authors\\n', 'urged, were necessary to safeguard the purity of the ballot, not merely\\n', 'in the South where the timid freedman might readily be frightened from\\n', 'using it; but also in the North, particularly in New York City, where it\\n', 'was claimed that fraud was regularly practiced by Democratic leaders.\\n', '\\n', 'The Democrats, on their side, indignantly denied the charges, replying\\n', 'that the force bills were nothing but devices created by the Republicans\\n', 'for the purpose of securing their continued rule through systematic\\n', 'interference with elections. Even the measures of reconstruction were\\n', 'deemed by Democratic leaders as thinly veiled schemes to establish\\n', 'Republican power throughout the country. \"Nor is there the slightest\\n', 'York and candidate for President in 1876, \"that the paramount object and\\n', 'motive of the Republican party is by these means to secure itself\\n', 'against a reaction of opinion adverse to it in our great populous\\n', 'Northern commonwealths.... When the Republican party resolved to\\n', 'establish negro supremacy in the ten states in order to gain to itself\\n', 'the representation of those states in Congress, it had to begin by\\n', 'governing the people of those states by the sword.... The next was the\\n', 'creation of new electoral bodies for those ten states, in which, by\\n', 'exclusions, by disfranchisements and proscriptions, by control over\\n', 'registration, by applying test oaths ... by intimidation and by every\\n', 'form of influence, three million negroes are made to predominate over\\n', 'four and a half million whites.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The War as a Campaign Issue.=--Even the repeal of force bills could not\\n', 'allay the sectional feelings engendered by the war. The Republicans\\n', 'could not forgive the men who had so recently been in arms against the\\n', 'union and insisted on calling them \"traitors\" and \"rebels.\" The\\n', 'Southerners, smarting under the reconstruction acts, could regard the\\n', 'Republicans only as political oppressors. The passions of the war had\\n', 'been too strong; the distress too deep to be soon forgotten. The\\n', 'generation that went through it all remembered it all. For twenty\\n', 'years, the Republicans, in their speeches and platforms, made \"a\\n', 'straight appeal to the patriotism of the Northern voters.\" They\\n', 'maintained that their party, which had saved the union and emancipated\\n', 'the slaves, was alone worthy of protecting the union and uplifting the\\n', 'freedmen.\\n', '\\n', 'Though the Democrats, especially in the North, resented this policy and\\n', 'dubbed it with the expressive but inelegant phrase, \"waving the bloody\\n', 'shirt,\" the Republicans refused to surrender a slogan which made such a\\n', 'ready popular appeal. As late as 1884, a leader expressed the hope that\\n', 'they might \"wring one more President from the bloody shirt.\" They\\n', 'refused to let the country forget that the Democratic candidate, Grover\\n', 'Cleveland, had escaped military service by hiring a substitute; and they\\n', 'made political capital out of the fact that he had \"insulted the\\n', 'veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic\" by going fishing on\\n', 'Decoration Day.\\n', '\\n', '=Three Republican Presidents.=--Fortified by all these elements of\\n', 'strength, the Republicans held the presidency from 1869 to 1885. The\\n', 'three Presidents elected in this period, Grant, Hayes, and Garfield, had\\n', 'certain striking characteristics in common. They were all of origin\\n', 'humble enough to please the most exacting Jacksonian Democrat. They had\\n', 'been generals in the union army. Grant, next to Lincoln, was regarded as\\n', 'the savior of the Constitution. Hayes and Garfield, though lesser lights\\n', 'in the military firmament, had honorable records duly appreciated by\\n', 'veterans of the war, now thoroughly organized into the Grand Army of the\\n', 'Republic. It is true that Grant was not a politician and had never voted\\n', 'the Republican ticket; but this was readily overlooked. Hayes and\\n', 'Garfield on the other hand were loyal party men. The former had served\\n', 'in Congress and for three terms as governor of his state. The latter had\\n', 'long been a member of the House of Representatives and was Senator-elect\\n', 'when he received the nomination for President.\\n', '\\n', 'All of them possessed, moreover, another important asset, which was not\\n', 'forgotten by the astute managers who led in selecting candidates. All\\n', 'of them were from Ohio--though Grant had been in Illinois when the\\n', 'summons to military duties came--and Ohio was a strategic state. It lay\\n', 'between the manufacturing East and the agrarian country to the West.\\n', 'Having growing industries and wool to sell it benefited from the\\n', 'protective tariff. Yet being mainly agricultural still, it was not\\n', '\\n', 'without sympathy for the farmers who showed low tariff or free trade\\n', 'tendencies. Whatever share the East had in shaping laws and framing\\n', 'policies, it was clear that the West was to have the candidates. This\\n', 'division in privileges--not uncommon in political management--was always\\n', 'accompanied by a judicious selection of the candidate for Vice\\n', 'President. With Garfield, for example, was associated a prominent New\\n', \"to more than three years' service as chief magistrate, on the\\n\", 'assassination of his superior in office.\\n', '\\n', '=The Disputed Election of 1876.=--While taking note of the long years of\\n', 'Republican supremacy, it must be recorded that grave doubts exist in the\\n', 'minds of many historians as to whether one of the three Presidents,\\n', 'Hayes, was actually the victor in 1876 or not. His Democratic opponent,\\n', 'and had a plausible claim to a majority of the electoral vote. At all\\n', 'events, four states sent in double returns, one set for Tilden and\\n', 'another for Hayes; and a deadlock ensued. Both parties vehemently\\n', 'claimed the election and the passions ran so high that sober men did not\\n', 'shrink from speaking of civil war again. Fortunately, in the end, the\\n', 'counsels of peace prevailed. Congress provided for an electoral\\n', 'commission of fifteen men to review the contested returns. The\\n', \"Democrats, inspired by Tilden's moderation, accepted the judgment in\\n\", 'favor of Hayes even though they were not convinced that he was really\\n', 'entitled to the office.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Abuses in American Political Life.=--During their long tenure of\\n', 'office, the Republicans could not escape the inevitable consequences of\\n', 'power; that is, evil practices and corrupt conduct on the part of some\\n', 'who found shelter within the party. For that matter neither did the\\n', 'Democrats manage to avoid such difficulties in those states and cities\\n', 'where they had the majority. In New York City, for instance, the local\\n', 'Democratic organization, known as Tammany Hall, passed under the sway of\\n', 'a group of politicians headed by \"Boss\" Tweed. He plundered the city\\n', 'the Democratic leader of the state, rose in revolt, drove the ringleader\\n', 'from power, and sent him to jail. In Philadelphia, the local Republican\\n', 'bosses were guilty of offenses as odious as those committed by New York\\n', 'politicians. Indeed, the decade that followed the Civil War was marred\\n', 'by so many scandals in public life that one acute editor was moved to\\n', 'inquire: \"Are not all the great communities of the Western World growing\\n', 'more corrupt as they grow in wealth?\"\\n', '\\n', 'In the sphere of national politics, where the opportunities were\\n', 'greater, betrayals of public trust were even more flagrant. One\\n', 'revelation after another showed officers, high and low, possessed with\\n', 'the spirit of peculation. Members of Congress, it was found, accepted\\n', 'railway stock in exchange for votes in favor of land grants and other\\n', 'concessions to the companies. In the administration as well as the\\n', 'legislature the disease was rife. Revenue officers permitted whisky\\n', 'probe into the post-office department revealed the malodorous \"star\\n', 'route frauds\"--the deliberate overpayment of certain mail carriers whose\\n', 'lines were indicated in the official record by asterisks or stars. Even\\n', 'cabinet officers did not escape suspicion, for the trail of the serpent\\n', 'led straight to the door of one of them.\\n', '\\n', 'In the lower ranges of official life, the spoils system became more\\n', 'virulent as the number of federal employees increased. The holders of\\n', 'offices and the seekers after them constituted a veritable political\\n', 'army. They crowded into Republican councils, for the Republicans, being\\n', 'in power, could alone dispense federal favors. They filled positions in\\n', 'the party ranging from the lowest township committee to the national\\n', 'convention. They helped to nominate candidates and draft platforms and\\n', 'elbowed to one side the busy citizen, not conversant with party\\n', 'intrigues, who could only give an occasional day to political matters.\\n', 'Even the Civil Service Act of 1883, wrung from a reluctant Congress two\\n', 'years after the assassination of Garfield, made little change for a long\\n', 'time. It took away from the spoilsmen a few thousand government\\n', 'positions, but it formed no check on the practice of rewarding party\\n', 'workers from the public treasury.\\n', '\\n', 'On viewing this state of affairs, many a distinguished citizen became\\n', 'profoundly discouraged. James Russell Lowell, for example, thought he\\n', \"saw a steady decline in public morals. In 1865, hearing of Lee's\\n\", 'surrender, he had exclaimed: \"There is something magnificent in having a\\n', 'country to love!\" Ten years later, when asked to write an ode for the\\n', 'centennial at Philadelphia in 1876, he could think only of a biting\\n', 'satire on the nation:\\n', '\\n', '    \"Show your state legislatures; show your Rings;\\n', '     And challenge Europe to produce such things\\n', '     As high officials sitting half in sight\\n', '     To share the plunder and fix things right.\\n', \"     If that don't fetch her, why, you need only\\n\", '     To show your latest style in martyrs,--Tweed:\\n', \"     She'll find it hard to hide her spiteful tears\\n\", '     At such advance in one poor hundred years.\"\\n', '\\n', 'When his critics condemned him for this \"attack upon his native land,\"\\n', 'Lowell replied in sadness: \"These fellows have no notion of what love of\\n', 'American who ever was?... What fills me with doubt and dismay is the\\n', 'degradation of the moral tone. Is it or is it not a result of democracy?\\n', \"Is ours a 'government of the people, by the people, for the people,' or\\n\", 'a Kakistocracy [a government of the worst], rather for the benefit of\\n', 'knaves at the cost of fools?\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Reform Movement in Republican Ranks.=--The sentiments expressed by\\n', 'Lowell, himself a Republican and for a time American ambassador to\\n', 'England, were shared by many men in his party. Very soon after the close\\n', 'of the Civil War some of them began to protest vigorously against the\\n', 'policies and conduct of their leaders. In 1872, the dissenters, calling\\n', 'themselves Liberal Republicans, broke away altogether, nominated a\\n', 'candidate of their own, Horace Greeley, and put forward a platform\\n', 'indicting the Republican President fiercely enough to please the most\\n', 'uncompromising Democrat. They accused Grant of using \"the powers and\\n', 'opportunities of his high office for the promotion of personal ends.\"\\n', 'They charged him with retaining \"notoriously corrupt and unworthy men in\\n', 'places of power and responsibility.\" They alleged that the Republican\\n', 'party kept \"alive the passions and resentments of the late civil war to\\n', 'use them for their own advantages,\" and employed the \"public service of\\n', 'the government as a machinery of corruption and personal influence.\"\\n', '\\n', 'It was not apparent, however, from the ensuing election that any\\n', 'considerable number of Republicans accepted the views of the Liberals.\\n', 'Greeley, though indorsed by the Democrats, was utterly routed and died\\n', 'of a broken heart. The lesson of his discomfiture seemed to be that\\n', 'independent action was futile. So, at least, it was regarded by most men\\n', 'of the rising generation like Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts, and\\n', 'Theodore Roosevelt, of New York. Profiting by the experience of Greeley\\n', 'they insisted in season and out that reformers who desired to rid the\\n', 'party of abuses should remain loyal to it and do their work \"on the\\n', 'inside.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Mugwumps and Cleveland Democracy in 1884.=--Though aided by\\n', 'Republican dissensions, the Democrats were slow in making headway\\n', 'against the political current. They were deprived of the energetic and\\n', 'capable leadership once afforded by the planters, like Calhoun, Davis,\\n', 'and Toombs; they were saddled by their opponents with responsibility for\\n', 'secession; and they were stripped of the support of the prostrate\\n', 'South. Not until the last Southern state was restored to the union, not\\n', 'until a general amnesty was wrung from Congress, not until white\\n', 'supremacy was established at the polls, and the last federal soldier\\n', 'withdrawn from Southern capitals did they succeed in capturing the\\n', 'presidency.\\n', '\\n', 'The opportune moment for them came in 1884 when a number of\\n', 'circumstances favored their aspirations. The Republicans, leaving the\\n', 'of Maine, a vigorous and popular leader but a man under fire from the\\n', 'reformers in his own party. The Democrats on their side were able to\\n', 'find at this juncture an able candidate who had no political enemies in\\n', 'the sphere of national politics, Grover Cleveland, then governor of New\\n', 'York and widely celebrated as a man of \"sterling honesty.\" At the same\\n', 'time a number of dissatisfied Republicans openly espoused the Democratic\\n', 'cause,--among them Carl Schurz, George William Curtis, Henry Ward\\n', 'Beecher, and William Everett, men of fine ideals and undoubted\\n', 'integrity. Though the \"regular\" Republicans called them \"Mugwumps\" and\\n', 'laughed at them as the \"men milliners, the dilettanti, and carpet\\n', 'knights of politics,\" they had a following that was not to be despised.\\n', '\\n', 'The campaign which took place that year was one of the most savage in\\n', 'American history. Issues were thrust into the background. The tariff,\\n', 'though mentioned, was not taken seriously. Abuse of the opposition was\\n', 'the favorite resource of party orators. The Democrats insisted that \"the\\n', 'Republican party so far as principle is concerned is a reminiscence. In\\n', 'practice it is an organization for enriching those who control its\\n', 'machinery.\" For the Republican candidate, Blaine, they could hardly find\\n', 'words to express their contempt. The Republicans retaliated in kind.\\n', 'They praised their own good works, as of old, in saving the union, and\\n', 'denounced the \"fraud and violence practiced by the Democracy in the\\n', 'Southern states.\" Seeing little objectionable in the public record of\\n', 'Cleveland as mayor of Buffalo and governor of New York, they attacked\\n', 'his personal character. Perhaps never in the history of political\\n', 'campaigns did the discussions on the platform and in the press sink to\\n', 'so low a level. Decent people were sickened. Even hot partisans shrank\\n', 'from their own words when, after the election, they had time to reflect\\n', 'on their heedless passions. Moreover, nothing was decided by the\\n', 'change of a few hundred votes in New York would have sent his opponent\\n', 'to the White House instead.\\n', '\\n', '=Changing Political Fortunes (1888-96).=--After the Democrats had\\n', 'settled down to the enjoyment of their hard-earned victory, President\\n', 'Cleveland in his message of 1887 attacked the tariff as \"vicious,\\n', 'inequitable, and illogical\"; as a system of taxation that laid a burden\\n', 'upon \"every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufacturers.\"\\n', 'Business enterprise was thoroughly alarmed. The Republicans\\n', 'characterized the tariff message as a free-trade assault upon the\\n', 'industries of the country. Mainly on that issue they elected in 1888\\n', 'Benjamin Harrison of Indiana, a shrewd lawyer, a reticent politician, a\\n', 'descendant of the hero of Tippecanoe, and a son of the old Northwest.\\n', 'Accepting the outcome of the election as a vindication of their\\n', 'principles, the Republicans, under the leadership of William McKinley in\\n', 'the House of Representatives, enacted in 1890 a tariff law imposing the\\n', 'highest duties yet laid in our history. To their utter surprise,\\n', 'however, they were instantly informed by the country that their program\\n', 'was not approved.

Congress, by legislation initiated\\n', 'in 1862, provided for the immediate organization of companies to build a\\n', 'line from the Missouri River to California and made grants of land and\\n', 'loans of money to aid in the enterprise. The Western end, the Central\\n', 'Pacific, was laid out under the supervision of Leland Stanford. It was\\n', 'heavily financed by the Mormons of Utah and also by the state\\n', 'government, the ranchmen, miners, and business men of California; and it\\n', 'was built principally by Chinese labor. The Eastern end, the Union\\n', 'Pacific, starting at Omaha, was constructed mainly by veterans of the\\n', 'Civil War and immigrants from Ireland and Germany.

They sent\\n', 'missionaries to spread the gospel of \"Western opportunity\" to people in\\n', 'the Middle West, in the Eastern cities, and in Southern states. Then\\n', 'they carried their enthusiastic converts bag and baggage in long trains\\n', 'to the distant Dakotas and still farther afield. So the development of\\n', 'the Far West was not left to the tedious processes of time. It was\\n', 'pushed by men of imagination--adventurers who made a romance of\\n', 'money-making and who had dreams of empire unequaled by many kings of the\\n', 'past.\\n', '\\n', 'These empire builders bought railway lands in huge tracts; they got more\\n', 'from the government; they overcame every obstacle of canon, mountain,\\n', 'and stream with the aid of science; they built cities according to the\\n', 'plans made by the engineers. Having the towns ready and railway and\\n', 'steamboat connections formed with the rest of the world, they carried\\n', 'out the people to use the railways, the steamships, the houses, and the\\n', 'land. It was in this way that \"the frontier speculator paved the way for\\n', 'the frontier agriculturalist who had to be near a market before he could\\n', 'farm.\" The spirit of this imaginative enterprise, which laid out\\n', 'railways and towns in advance of the people, is seen in an advertisement\\n', 'of that day: \"This extension will run 42 miles from York, northeast\\n', 'through the Island Lake country, and will have five good North Dakota\\n', 'towns. The stations on the line will be well equipped with elevators and\\n', 'will be constructed and ready for operation at the commencement of the\\n', 'grain season. Prospective merchants have been active in securing\\n', 'desirable locations at the different towns on the line. There are still\\n', 'opportunities for hotels, general merchandise, hardware, furniture, and\\n', 'drug stores, etc.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'of the Great Northern and allied lines, was one of the most forceful\\n', 'figures. He knew that tracks and trains were useless without passengers\\n', 'and freight; without a population of farmers and town dwellers. He\\n', 'therefore organized publicity in the Virginias, Iowa, Ohio, Indiana,\\n', 'Illinois, Wisconsin, and Nebraska especially. He sent out agents to tell\\n', 'the story of Western opportunity in this vein: \"You see your children\\n', 'come out of school with no chance to get farms of their own because the\\n', \"cost of land in your older part of the country is so high that you can't\\n\", 'afford to buy land to start your sons out in life around you. They have\\n', 'to go to the cities to make a living or become laborers in the mills or\\n', 'hire out as farm hands. There is no future for them there. If you are\\n', 'doing well where you are and can safeguard the future of your children\\n', \"and see them prosper around you, don't leave here. But if you want\\n\", 'independence, if you are renting your land, if the money-lender is\\n', 'carrying you along and you are running behind year after year, you can\\n', 'do no worse by moving.... You farmers talk of free trade and protection\\n', \"and what this or that political party will do for you. Why don't you\\n\", 'vote a homestead for yourself? That is the only thing Uncle Sam will\\n', \"ever give you. Jim Hill hasn't an acre of land to sell you. We are not\\n\", \"in the real estate business. We don't want you to go out West and make a\\n\", 'failure of it because the rates at which we haul you and your goods make\\n', 'the first transaction a loss.... We must have landless men for a manless\\n', 'land.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Unlike steamship companies stimulating immigration to get the fares,\\n', 'Hill was seeking permanent settlers who would produce, manufacture, and\\n', 'use the railways as the means of exchange. Consequently he fixed low\\n', 'rates and let his passengers take a good deal of live stock and\\n', 'household furniture free. By doing this he made an appeal that was\\n', 'answered by eager families. In 1894 the vanguard of home seekers left\\n', 'Indiana in fourteen passenger coaches, filled with men, women, and\\n', 'children, and forty-eight freight cars carrying their household goods\\n', 'and live stock. In the ten years that followed, 100,000 people from the\\n', 'Middle West and the South, responding to his call, went to the Western\\n', 'country where they brought eight million acres of prairie land under\\n', 'cultivation.\\n', '\\n', 'When Hill got his people on the land, he took an interest in everything\\n', 'that increased the productivity of their labor. Was the output of food\\n', 'for his freight cars limited by bad drainage on the farms? Hill then\\n', 'interested himself in practical ways of ditching and tiling. Were\\n', 'farmers hampered in hauling their goods to his trains by bad roads? In\\n', 'that case, he urged upon the states the improvement of highways. Did the\\n', 'traffic slacken because the food shipped was not of the best quality?\\n', 'Then live stock must be improved and scientific farming promoted. Did\\n', 'the farmers need credit? Banks must be established close at hand to\\n', 'advance it. In all conferences on scientific farm management,\\n', 'conservation of natural resources, banking and credit in relation to\\n', 'agriculture and industry, Hill was an active participant. His was the\\n', 'long vision, seeing in conservation and permanent improvements the\\n', 'foundation of prosperity for the railways and the people.\\n', '\\n', 'Indeed, he neglected no opportunity to increase the traffic on the\\n', 'lines. He wanted no empty cars running in either direction and no wheat\\n', 'stored in warehouses for the lack of markets. So he looked to the Orient\\n', 'as well as to Europe as an outlet for the surplus of the farms. He sent\\n', 'agents to China and Japan to discover what American goods and produce\\n', 'those countries would consume and what manufactures they had to offer to\\n', 'Americans in exchange. To open the Pacific trade he bought two ocean\\n', 'monsters, the _Minnesota_ and the _Dakota_, thus preparing for\\n', 'emergencies West as well as East. When some Japanese came to the United\\n', 'States on their way to Europe to buy steel rails, Hill showed them how\\n', 'easy it was for them to make their purchase in this country and ship by\\n', 'way of American railways and American vessels. So the railway builder\\n', 'and promoter, who helped to break the virgin soil of the prairies, lived\\n', 'through the pioneer epoch and into the age of great finance. Before he\\n', 'died he saw the wheat fields of North Dakota linked with the spinning\\n', 'jennies of Manchester and the docks of Yokohama.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Removal of the Indians.=--Unlike the frontier of New England in\\n', 'colonial days or that of Kentucky later, the advancing lines of home\\n', 'builders in the Far West had little difficulty with warlike natives.\\n', 'Indian attacks were made on the railway construction gangs; General\\n', 'Custer had his fatal battle with the Sioux in 1876 and there were minor\\n', 'brushes; but they were all of relatively slight consequence. The former\\n', 'practice of treating with the Indians as independent nations was\\n', 'abandoned in 1871 and most of them were concentrated in reservations\\n', 'where they were mainly supported by the government. The supervision of\\n', 'their affairs was vested in a board of commissioners created in 1869 and\\n', 'instructed to treat them as wards of the nation--a trust which\\n', 'taken in 1887 when provision was made for issuing lands to individual\\n', 'Indians, thus permitting them to become citizens and settle down among\\n', 'their white neighbors as farmers or cattle raisers. The disappearance of\\n', 'the buffalo, the main food supply of the wild Indians, had made them\\n', 'more tractable and more willing to surrender the freedom of the hunter\\n', 'for the routine of the reservation, ranch, or wheat field.\\n', '\\n', '=The Cowboy and Cattle Ranger.=--Between the frontier of farms and the\\n', 'mountains were plains and semi-arid regions in vast reaches suitable for\\n', 'grazing. As soon as the railways were open into the Missouri Valley,\\n', 'affording an outlet for stock, there sprang up to the westward cattle\\n', 'and sheep raising on an immense scale. The far-famed American cowboy was\\n', 'the hero in this scene. Great herds of cattle were bred in Texas; with\\n', 'the advancing spring and summer seasons, they were driven northward\\n', 'across the plains and over the buffalo trails. In a single year, 1884,\\n', 'it is estimated that nearly one million head of cattle were moved out of\\n', 'Texas to the North by four thousand cowboys, supplied with 30,000\\n', 'horses and ponies.\\n', '\\n', 'During the two decades from 1870 to 1890 both the cattle men and the\\n', 'sheep raisers had an almost free run of the plains, using public lands\\n', 'without paying for the privilege and waging war on one another over the\\n', 'possession of ranges. At length, however, both had to go, as the\\n', 'homesteaders and land companies came and fenced in the plain and desert\\n', 'with endless lines of barbed wire. Already in 1893 a writer familiar\\n', 'with the frontier lamented the passing of the picturesque days: \"The\\n', 'unique position of the cowboys among the Americans is jeopardized in a\\n', 'thousand ways. Towns are growing up on their pasture lands; irrigation\\n', 'schemes of a dozen sorts threaten to turn bunch-grass scenery into\\n', 'farm-land views; farmers are pre-empting valleys and the sides of\\n', 'waterways; and the day is not far distant when stock-raising must be\\n', \"done mainly in small herds, with winter corrals, and then the cowboy's\\n\", 'days will end. Even now his condition disappoints those who knew him\\n', 'only half a dozen years ago. His breed seems to have deteriorated and\\n', 'his ranks are filling with men who work for wages rather than for the\\n', 'love of the free life and bold companionship that once tempted men into\\n', 'that calling. Splendid Cheyenne saddles are less and less numerous in\\n', 'the outfits; the distinctive hat that made its way up from Mexico may or\\n', 'may not be worn; all the civil authorities in nearly all towns in the\\n', 'grazing country forbid the wearing of side arms; nobody shoots up these\\n', 'towns any more. The fact is the old simon-pure cowboy days are gone\\n', 'already.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Settlement under the Homestead Act of 1862.=--Two factors gave a\\n', 'special stimulus to the rapid settlement of Western lands which swept\\n', 'away the Indians and the cattle rangers. The first was the policy of the\\n', 'railway companies in selling large blocks of land received from the\\n', 'government at low prices to induce immigration. The second was the\\n', 'operation of the Homestead law passed in 1862. This measure practically\\n', 'closed the long controversy over the disposition of the public domain\\n', 'that was suitable for agriculture. It provided for granting, without any\\n', 'cost save a small registration fee, public lands in lots of 160 acres\\n', 'each to citizens and aliens who declared their intention of becoming\\n', 'citizens. The one important condition attached was that the settler\\n', 'should occupy the farm for five years before his title was finally\\n', 'confirmed. Even this stipulation was waived in the case of the Civil War\\n', 'veterans who were allowed to count their term of military service as a\\n', \"part of the five years' occupancy required. As the soldiers of the\\n\", 'Revolutionary and Mexican wars had advanced in great numbers to the\\n', 'frontier in earlier days, so now veterans led in the settlement of the\\n', 'middle border. Along with them went thousands of German, Irish, and\\n', 'Scandinavian immigrants, fresh from the Old World. Between 1867 and\\n', '1874, 27,000,000 acres were staked out in quarter-section farms. In\\n', 'twenty years (1860-80), the population of Nebraska leaped from 28,000 to\\n', 'almost half a million; Kansas from 100,000 to a million; Iowa from\\n', '600,000 to 1,600,000; and the Dakotas from 5000 to 140,000.\\n', '\\n', '=The Diversity of Western Agriculture.=--In soil, produce, and\\n', 'management, Western agriculture presented many contrasts to that of the\\n', 'East and South. In the region of arable and watered lands the typical\\n', 'American unit--the small farm tilled by the owner--appeared as usual;\\n', 'but by the side of it many a huge domain owned by foreign or Eastern\\n', 'companies and tilled by hired labor. Sometimes the great estate took the\\n', 'shape of the \"bonanza farm\" devoted mainly to wheat and corn and\\n', 'cultivated on a large scale by machinery. Again it assumed the form of\\n', 'the cattle ranch embracing tens of thousands of acres. Again it was a\\n', 'vast holding of diversified interest, such as the Santa Anita ranch near\\n', 'Los Angeles, a domain of 60,000 acres \"cultivated in a glorious sweep of\\n', 'vineyards and orange and olive orchards, rich sheep and cattle pastures\\n', 'and horse ranches, their life and customs handed down from the Spanish\\n', 'owners of the various ranches which were swept into one estate.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Irrigation.=--In one respect agriculture in the Far West was unique. In\\n', 'a large area spreading through eight states, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming,\\n', 'Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of adjoining\\n', 'states, the rainfall was so slight that the ordinary crops to which the\\n', 'American farmer was accustomed could not be grown at all. The Mormons\\n', 'were the first Anglo-Saxons to encounter aridity, and they were baffled\\n', 'at first; but they studied it and mastered it by magnificent irrigation\\n', 'systems. As other settlers poured into the West the problem of the\\n', 'desert was attacked with a will, some of them replying to the\\n', 'commiseration of Eastern farmers by saying that it was easier to scoop\\n', 'out an irrigation ditch than to cut forests and wrestle with stumps and\\n', 'stones. Private companies bought immense areas at low prices, built\\n', 'irrigation works, and disposed of their lands in small plots. Some\\n', 'ranchers with an instinct for water, like that of the miner for metal,\\n', 'sank wells into the dry sand and were rewarded with gushers that \"soused\\n', 'the thirsty desert and turned its good-for-nothing sand into\\n', 'good-for-anything loam.\" The federal government came to the aid of the\\n', 'arid regions in 1894 by granting lands to the states to be used for\\n', 'irrigation purposes. In this work Wyoming took the lead with a law which\\n', 'induced capitalists to invest in irrigation and at the same time\\n', 'provided for the sale of the redeemed lands to actual settlers. Finally\\n', 'in 1902 the federal government by its liberal Reclamation Act added its\\n', 'strength to that of individuals, companies, and states in conquering\\n', '\"arid America.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nowhere,\" writes Powell, a historian of the West, in his picturesque\\n', '_End of the Trail_, \"has the white man fought a more courageous fight or\\n', 'won a more brilliant victory than in Arizona. His weapons have been the\\n', 'transit and the level, the drill and the dredge, the pick and the spade;\\n', 'and the enemy which he has conquered has been the most stubborn of all\\n', 'foes--the hostile forces of Nature.... The story of how the white man\\n', 'within the space of less than thirty years penetrated, explored, and\\n', 'mapped this almost unknown region; of how he carried law, order, and\\n', 'justice into a section which had never had so much as a speaking\\n', 'acquaintance with any one of the three before; of how, realizing the\\n', 'necessity for means of communication, he built highways of steel across\\n', 'this territory from east to west and from north to south; of how,\\n', 'undismayed by the savageness of the countenance which the desert turned\\n', 'upon him, he laughed and rolled up his sleeves, and spat upon his hands,\\n', 'and slashed the face of the desert with canals and irrigating ditches,\\n', 'and filled those ditches with water brought from deep in the earth or\\n', 'high in the mountains; and of how, in the conquered and submissive soil,\\n', 'he replaced the aloe with alfalfa, the mesquite with maize, the cactus\\n', 'with cotton, forms one of the most inspiring chapters in our history. It\\n', 'is one of the epics of civilization, this reclamation of the Southwest,\\n', 'and its heroes, thank God, are Americans.\\n', '\\n', '\"Other desert regions have been redeemed by irrigation--Egypt, for\\n', 'example, and Mesopotamia and parts of the Sudan--but the people of all\\n', 'those regions lay stretched out in the shade of a convenient palm,\\n', 'metaphorically speaking, and waited for some one with more energy than\\n', 'themselves to come along and do the work. But the Arizonians, mindful of\\n', 'the fact that God, the government, and Carnegie help those who help\\n', 'themselves, spent their days wielding the pick and shovel, and their\\n', 'evenings in writing letters to Washington with toil-hardened hands.\\n', 'After a time the government was prodded into action and the great dams\\n', 'at Laguna and Roosevelt are the result. Then the people, organizing\\n', \"themselves into cooperative leagues and water-users' associations, took\\n\", 'up the work of reclamation where the government left off; it is to these\\n', 'energetic, persevering men who have drilled wells, plowed fields, and\\n', 'dug ditches through the length and breadth of that great region which\\n', 'stretches from Yuma to Tucson, that the metamorphosis of Arizona is\\n', 'due.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The effect of irrigation wherever introduced was amazing. Stretches of\\n', 'sand and sagebrush gave way to fertile fields bearing crops of wheat,\\n', 'corn, fruits, vegetables, and grass. Huge ranches grazed by browsing\\n', 'sheep were broken up into small plots. The cowboy and ranchman vanished.\\n', 'In their place rose the prosperous community--a community unlike the\\n', 'township of Iowa or the industrial center of the East. Its intensive\\n', 'tillage left little room for hired labor. Its small holdings drew\\n', 'families together in village life rather than dispersing them on the\\n', 'lonely plain. Often the development of water power in connection with\\n', 'irrigation afforded electricity for labor-saving devices and lifted many\\n', 'a burden that in other days fell heavily upon the shoulders of the\\n', 'farmer and his family.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Mineral Resources.=--In another important particular the Far West\\n', 'differed from the Mississippi Valley states. That was in the\\n', 'predominance of mining over agriculture throughout a vast section.\\n', 'Indeed it was the minerals rather than the land that attracted the\\n', 'pioneers who first opened the country. The discovery of gold in\\n', 'California in 1848 was the signal for the great rush of prospectors,\\n', 'miners, and promoters who explored the valleys, climbed the hills,\\n', 'washed the sands, and dug up the soil in their feverish search for gold,\\n', 'silver, copper, coal, and other minerals. In Nevada and Montana the\\n', 'development of mineral resources went on all during the Civil War. Alder\\n', 'Gulch became Virginia City in 1863; Last Chance Gulch was named Helena\\n', 'in 1864; and Confederate Gulch was christened Diamond City in 1865. At\\n', 'Butte the miners began operations in 1864 and within five years had\\n', \"washed out eight million dollars' worth of gold. Under the gold they\\n\", 'found silver; under silver they found copper.\\n', '\\n', 'Even at the end of the nineteenth century, after agriculture was well\\n', 'advanced and stock and sheep raising introduced on a large scale,\\n', 'minerals continued to be the chief source of wealth in a number of\\n', 'states. This was revealed by the figures for 1910. The gold, silver,\\n', 'iron, and copper of Colorado were worth more than the wheat, corn, and\\n', 'oats combined; the copper of Montana sold for more than all the cereals\\n', 'and four times the price of the wheat. The interest of Nevada was also\\n', 'mainly mining, the receipts from the mineral output being $43,000,000 or\\n', \"more than one-half the national debt of Hamilton's day. The yield of the\\n\", 'mines of Utah was worth four or five times the wheat crop; the coal of\\n', 'Wyoming brought twice as much as the great wool clip; the minerals of\\n', 'Arizona were totaled at $43,000,000 as against a wool clip reckoned at\\n', '$1,200,000; while in Idaho alone of this group of states did the wheat\\n', 'crop exceed in value the output of the mines.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Timber Resources.=--The forests of the great West, unlike those of the\\n', 'Ohio Valley, proved a boon to the pioneers rather than a foe to be\\n', 'attacked. In Ohio and Indiana, for example, the frontier line of\\n', 'homemakers had to cut, roll, and burn thousands of trees before they\\n', 'could put out a crop of any size. Beyond the Mississippi, however,\\n', 'there were all ready for the breaking plow great reaches of almost\\n', 'treeless prairie, where every stick of timber was precious. In the other\\n', 'parts, often rough and mountainous, where stood primeval forests of the\\n', 'finest woods, the railroads made good use of the timber. They consumed\\n', 'acres of forests themselves in making ties, bridge timbers, and\\n', 'telegraph poles, and they laid a heavy tribute upon the forests for\\n', 'their annual upkeep. The surplus trees, such as had burdened the\\n', 'pioneers of the Northwest Territory a hundred years before, they carried\\n', 'off to markets on the east and west coasts.\\n', '\\n', '=Western Industries.=--The peculiar conditions of the Far West\\n', 'stimulated a rise of industries more rapid than is usual in new country.\\n', 'The mining activities which in many sections preceded agriculture called\\n', 'for sawmills to furnish timber for the mines and smelters to reduce and\\n', 'refine ores. The ranches supplied sheep and cattle for the packing\\n', 'houses of Kansas City as well as Chicago. The waters of the Northwest\\n', 'afforded salmon for 4000 cases in 1866 and for 1,400,000 cases in 1916.\\n', 'The fruits and vegetables of California brought into existence\\n', 'innumerable canneries. The lumber industry, starting with crude sawmills\\n', 'to furnish rough timbers for railways and mines, ended in specialized\\n', 'factories for paper, boxes, and furniture. As the railways preceded\\n', 'settlement and furnished a ready outlet for local manufactures, so they\\n', 'encouraged the early establishment of varied industries, thus creating a\\n', 'state of affairs quite unlike that which obtained in the Ohio Valley in\\n', 'the early days before the opening of the Erie Canal.\\n', '\\n', '=Social Effects of Economic Activities.=--In many respects the social\\n', 'life of the Far West also differed from that of the Ohio Valley. The\\n', 'treeless prairies, though open to homesteads, favored the great estate\\n', 'tilled in part by tenant labor and in part by migratory seasonal labor,\\n', 'summoned from all sections of the country for the harvests. The mineral\\n', 'resources created hundreds of huge fortunes which made the accumulations\\n', 'of eastern mercantile families look trivial by comparison. Other\\n', 'millionaires won their fortunes in the railway business and still more\\n', 'from the cattle and sheep ranges. In many sections the \"cattle king,\" as\\n', 'he was called, was as dominant as the planter had been in the old South.\\n', 'Everywhere in the grazing country he was a conspicuous and important\\n', 'person. He \"sometimes invested money in banks, in railroad stocks, or in\\n', 'city property.... He had his rating in the commercial reviews and could\\n', 'hobnob with bankers, railroad presidents, and metropolitan merchants....\\n', 'He attended party caucuses and conventions, ran for the state\\n', \"legislature, and sometimes defeated a lawyer or metropolitan 'business\\n\", \"man' in the race for a seat in Congress. In proportion to their numbers,\\n\", 'the ranchers ... have constituted a highly impressive class.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Although many of the early capitalists of the great West, especially\\n', 'from Nevada, spent their money principally in the East, others took\\n', 'leadership in promoting the sections in which they had made their\\n', 'Springs, founded the town, and encouraged local improvements. Denver\\n', 'owed its first impressive buildings to the civic patriotism of Horace\\n', 'Tabor, a wealthy mine owner. Leland Stanford paid his tribute to\\n', 'better known as \"Buffalo Bill,\" started his career by building a \"boom\\n', 'town\" which collapsed, and made a large sum of money supplying buffalo\\n', 'meat to construction hands (hence his popular name). By his famous Wild\\n', 'West Show, he increased it to a fortune which he devoted mainly to the\\n', 'promotion of a western reclamation scheme.\\n', '\\n', 'While the Far West was developing this vigorous, aggressive leadership\\n', 'in business, a considerable industrial population was springing up. Even\\n', 'the cattle ranges and hundreds of farms were conducted like factories in\\n', 'that they were managed through overseers who hired plowmen, harvesters,\\n', 'and cattlemen at regular wages. At the same time there appeared other\\n', 'peculiar features which made a lasting impression on western economic\\n', 'life. Mining, lumbering, and fruit growing, for instance, employed\\n', 'thousands of workers during the rush months and turned them out at other\\n', 'times. The inevitable result was an army of migratory laborers wandering\\n', 'from camp to camp, from town to town, and from ranch to ranch, without\\n', 'fixed homes or established habits of life. From this extraordinary\\n', 'condition there issued many a long and lawless conflict between capital\\n', 'and labor, giving a distinct color to the labor movement in whole\\n', 'sections of the mountain and coast states.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Spirit of Self-Government.=--The instinct of self-government was\\n', 'strong in the western communities. In the very beginning, it led to the\\n', 'organization of volunteer committees, known as \"vigilantes,\" to suppress\\n', 'crime and punish criminals. As soon as enough people were settled\\n', 'permanently in a region, they took care to form a more stable kind of\\n', 'government. An illustration of this process is found in the Oregon\\n', 'compact made by the pioneers in 1843, the spirit of which is reflected\\n', 'in an editorial in an old copy of the _Rocky Mountain News_: \"We claim\\n', 'that any body or community of American citizens which from any cause or\\n', 'under any circumstances is cut off from or from isolation is so situated\\n', 'as not to be under any active and protecting branch of the central\\n', 'government, have a right, if on American soil, to frame a government and\\n', 'enact such laws and regulations as may be necessary for their own\\n', 'safety, protection, and happiness, always with the condition precedent,\\n', 'that they shall, at the earliest moment when the central government\\n', 'shall extend an effective organization and laws over them, give it their\\n', 'unqualified support and obedience.\"\\n', '\\n', 'People who turned so naturally to the organization of local\\n', 'administration were equally eager for admission to the union as soon as\\n', 'any shadow of a claim to statehood could be advanced. As long as a\\n', 'region was merely one of the territories of the United States, the\\n', 'appointment of the governor and other officers was controlled by\\n', 'politics at Washington. Moreover the disposition of land, mineral\\n', 'rights, forests, and water power was also in the hands of national\\n', 'leaders. Thus practical considerations were united with the spirit of\\n', 'independence in the quest for local autonomy.\\n', '\\n', '=Nebraska and Colorado.=--Two states, Nebraska and Colorado, had little\\n', 'difficulty in securing admission to the union. The first, Nebraska, had\\n', 'been organized as a territory by the famous Kansas-Nebraska bill which\\n', 'did so much to precipitate the Civil War. Lying to the north of Kansas,\\n', 'which had been admitted in 1861, it escaped the invasion of slave owners\\n', 'from Missouri and was settled mainly by farmers from the North. Though\\n', 'it claimed a population of only 67,000, it was regarded with kindly\\n', 'interest by the Republican Congress at Washington and, reduced to its\\n', 'present boundaries, it received the coveted statehood in 1867.\\n', '\\n', 'This was hardly accomplished before the people of Colorado to the\\n', 'southwest began to make known their demands. They had been organized\\n', 'under territorial government in 1861 when they numbered only a handful;\\n', 'but within ten years the aspect of their affairs had completely changed.\\n', 'The silver and gold deposits of the Leadville and Cripple Creek regions\\n', 'had attracted an army of miners and prospectors. The city of Denver,\\n', 'founded in 1858 and named after the governor of Kansas whence came many\\n', 'of the early settlers, had grown from a straggling camp of log huts into\\n', 'a prosperous center of trade. By 1875 it was reckoned that the\\n', 'population of the territory was not less than one hundred thousand; the\\n', 'following year Congress, yielding to the popular appeal, made Colorado a\\n', 'member of the American union.\\n', '\\n', '=Six New States (1889-1890).=--For many years there was a deadlock in\\n', 'Congress over the admission of new states. The spell was broken in 1889\\n', 'under the leadership of the Dakotas. For a long time the Dakota\\n', 'territory, organized in 1861, had been looked upon as the home of the\\n', 'powerful Sioux Indians whose enormous reservation blocked the advance of\\n', 'the frontier. The discovery of gold in the Black Hills, however, marked\\n', 'their doom. Even before Congress could open their lands to prospectors,\\n', 'pioneers were swarming over the country. Farmers from the adjoining\\n', 'Minnesota and the Eastern states, Scandinavians, Germans, and Canadians,\\n', 'came in swelling waves to occupy the fertile Dakota lands, now famous\\n', 'even as far away as the fjords of Norway. Seldom had the plow of man cut\\n', 'through richer soil than was found in the bottoms of the Red River\\n', 'Valley, and it became all the more precious when the opening of the\\n', 'Northern Pacific in 1883 afforded a means of transportation east and\\n', 'west. The population, which had numbered 135,000 in 1880, passed the\\n', 'half million mark before ten years had elapsed.\\n', '\\n', 'Remembering that Nebraska had been admitted with only 67,000\\n', 'inhabitants, the Dakotans could not see why they should be kept under\\n', 'federal tutelage. At the same time Washington, far away on the Pacific\\n', 'Coast, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, boasting of their populations and\\n', 'their riches, put in their own eloquent pleas. But the members of\\n', 'Congress were busy with politics. The Democrats saw no good reason for\\n', 'admitting new Republican states until after their defeat in 1888. Near\\n', 'the end of their term the next year they opened the door for North and\\n', 'South Dakota, Washington, and Montana. In 1890, a Republican Congress\\n', 'brought Idaho and Wyoming into the union, the latter with woman\\n', 'suffrage, which had been granted twenty-one years before.\\n', '\\n', '=Utah.=--Although Utah had long presented all the elements of a\\n', 'well-settled and industrious community, its admission to the union was\\n', 'delayed on account of popular hostility to the practice of polygamy. The\\n', 'custom, it is true, had been prohibited by act of Congress in 1862; but\\n', 'the law had been systematically evaded. In 1882 Congress made another\\n', 'and more effective effort to stamp out polygamy. Five years later it\\n', 'even went so far as to authorize the confiscation of the property of the\\n', 'Mormon Church in case the practice of plural marriages was not stopped.\\n', 'Meanwhile the Gentile or non-Mormon population was steadily increasing\\n', 'and the leaders in the Church became convinced that the battle\\n', 'against the sentiment of the country was futile. At last in 1896 Utah\\n', 'was admitted as a state under a constitution which forbade plural\\n', 'marriages absolutely and forever. Horace Greeley, who visited Utah in\\n', '1859, had prophesied that the Pacific Railroad would work a revolution\\n', 'in the land of Brigham Young. His prophecy had come true.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Rounding out the Continent.=--Three more territories now remained out\\n', 'of the Union. Oklahoma, long an Indian reservation, had been opened for\\n', 'settlement to white men in 1889. The rush upon the fertile lands of this\\n', 'region, the last in the history of America, was marked by all the frenzy\\n', 'of the final, desperate chance. At a signal from a bugle an army of men\\n', 'with families in wagons, men and women on horseback and on foot, burst\\n', 'into the territory. During the first night a city of tents was raised at\\n', 'Guthrie and Oklahoma City. In ten days wooden houses rose on the plains.\\n', 'In a single year there were schools, churches, business blocks, and\\n', 'newspapers. Within fifteen years there was a population of more than\\n', 'half a million. To the west, Arizona with a population of about 125,000\\n', 'and New Mexico with 200,000 inhabitants joined Oklahoma in asking for\\n', 'statehood. Congress, then Republican, looked with reluctance upon the\\n', 'addition of more Democratic states; but in 1907 it was literally\\n', 'compelled by public sentiment and a sense of justice to admit Oklahoma.\\n', 'In 1910 the House of Representatives went to the Democrats and within\\n', 'two years Arizona and New Mexico were \"under the roof.\" So the\\n', 'continental domain was rounded out.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Last of the Frontier.=--When Horace Greeley made his trip west in\\n', '1859 he thus recorded the progress of civilization in his journal:\\n', '\\n', '     \"May 12th, Chicago.--Chocolate and morning journals last\\n', '     seen on the hotel breakfast table.\\n', '\\n', '     23rd, Leavenworth (Kansas).--Room bells and bath tubs make\\n', '     their final appearance.\\n', '\\n', '     26th, Manhattan.--Potatoes and eggs last recognized among\\n', \"     the blessings that 'brighten as they take their flight.'\\n\", '\\n', '     27th, Junction City.--Last visitation of a boot-black, with\\n', '     dissolving views of a board bedroom.

Of far more consequence was the\\n', 'disappearance of free lands with all that meant for American labor. For\\n', 'more than a hundred years, any man of even moderate means had been able\\n', 'to secure a homestead of his own and an independent livelihood. For a\\n', 'hundred years America had been able to supply farms to as many\\n', 'immigrants as cared to till the soil. Every new pair of strong arms\\n', 'meant more farms and more wealth. Workmen in Eastern factories, mines,\\n', 'or mills who did not like their hours, wages, or conditions of labor,\\n', 'could readily find an outlet to the land. Now all that was over. By\\n', 'about 1890 most of the desirable land available under the Homestead act\\n', 'had disappeared. American industrial workers confronted a new situation.\\n', '\\n', '=Grain Supplants King Cotton.=--In the meantime a revolution was taking\\n', 'place in agriculture. Until 1860 the chief staples sold by America were\\n', 'cotton and tobacco. With the advance of the frontier, corn and wheat\\n', 'supplanted them both in agrarian economy. The West became the granary of\\n', 'the East and of Western Europe. The scoop shovel once used to handle\\n', 'grain was superseded by the towering elevator, loading and unloading\\n', 'thousands of bushels every hour. The refrigerator car and ship made the\\n', 'packing industry as stable as the production of cotton or corn, and gave\\n', 'an immense impetus to cattle raising and sheep farming. So the meat of\\n', 'the West took its place on the English dinner table by the side of bread\\n', 'baked from Dakotan wheat.\\n', '\\n', '=Aid in American Economic Independence.=--The effects of this economic\\n', \"movement were manifold and striking. Billions of dollars' worth of\\n\", 'American grain, dairy produce, and meat were poured into European\\n', 'markets where they paid off debts due money lenders and acquired\\n', 'capital to develop American resources. Thus they accelerated the\\n', 'progress of American financiers toward national independence. The\\n', 'country, which had timidly turned to the Old World for capital in\\n', \"Hamilton's day and had borrowed at high rates of interest in London in\\n\", \"Lincoln's day, moved swiftly toward the time when it would be among the\\n\", \"world's first bankers and money lenders itself. Every grain of wheat and\\n\", 'corn pulled the balance down on the American side of the scale.\\n', '\\n', '=Eastern Agriculture Affected.=--In the East as well as abroad the\\n', 'opening of the western granary produced momentous results. The\\n', 'agricultural economy of that part of the country was changed in many\\n', 'respects. Whole sections of the poorest land went almost out of\\n', 'cultivation, the abandoned farms of the New England hills bearing solemn\\n', 'witness to the competing power of western wheat fields. Sheep and cattle\\n', 'raising, as well as wheat and corn production, suffered at least a\\n', 'relative decline. Thousands of farmers cultivating land of the lower\\n', 'grade were forced to go West or were driven to the margin of\\n', 'subsistence. Even the herds that supplied Eastern cities with milk were\\n', 'fed upon grain brought halfway across the continent.\\n', '\\n', '=The Expansion of the American Market.=--Upon industry as well as\\n', 'agriculture, the opening of vast food-producing regions told in a\\n', 'thousand ways. The demand for farm machinery, clothing, boots, shoes,\\n', 'and other manufactures gave to American industries such a market as even\\n', 'Hamilton had never foreseen. Moreover it helped to expand far into the\\n', 'Mississippi Valley the industrial area once confined to the Northern\\n', 'seaboard states and to transform the region of the Great Lakes into an\\n', 'industrial empire. Herein lies the explanation of the growth of\\n', 'mid-western cities after 1865. Chicago, with its thirty-five railways,\\n', 'tapped every locality of the West and South. To the railways were added\\n', 'the water routes of the Lakes, thus creating a strategic center for\\n', 'industries. Long foresight carried the McCormick reaper works to\\n', 'Chicago before 1860. From Troy, New York, went a large stove plant. That\\n', 'was followed by a shoe factory from Massachusetts. The packing industry\\n', 'rose as a matter of course at a point so advantageous for cattle raisers\\n', 'and shippers and so well connected with Eastern markets.\\n', '\\n', 'To the opening of the Far West also the Lake region was indebted for a\\n', 'large part of that water-borne traffic which made it \"the Mediterranean\\n', 'basin of North America.\" The produce of the West and the manufactures of\\n', 'the East poured through it in an endless stream. The swift growth of\\n', 'shipbuilding on the Great Lakes helped to compensate for the decline of\\n', 'the American marine on the high seas. In response to this stimulus\\n', 'Detroit could boast that her shipwrights were able to turn out a ten\\n', 'thousand ton Leviathan for ore or grain about \"as quickly as carpenters\\n', 'could put up an eight-room house.\" Thus in relation to the Far West the\\n', \"old Northwest territory--the wilderness of Jefferson's time--had taken\\n\", 'the position formerly occupied by New England alone. It was supplying\\n', 'capital and manufactures for a vast agricultural empire West and South.\\n', '\\n', '=America on the Pacific.=--It has been said that the Mediterranean Sea\\n', 'was the center of ancient civilization; that modern civilization has\\n', 'developed on the shores of the Atlantic; and that the future belongs to\\n', 'the Pacific. At any rate, the sweep of the United States to the shores\\n', 'of the Pacific quickly exercised a powerful influence on world affairs\\n', 'and it undoubtedly has a still greater significance for the future.\\n', '\\n', 'Very early regular traffic sprang up between the Pacific ports and the\\n', 'Hawaiian Islands, China, and Japan. Two years before the adjustment of\\n', 'the Oregon controversy with England, namely in 1844, the United States\\n', 'had established official and trading relations with China. Ten years\\n', 'later, four years after the admission of California to the union, the\\n', 'barred door of Japan was forced open by Commodore Perry. The commerce\\n', 'which had long before developed between the Pacific ports and Hawaii,\\n', 'China, and Japan now flourished under official care. In 1865 a ship\\n', 'from Honolulu carried sugar, molasses, and fruits from Hawaii to the\\n', 'Oregon port of Astoria. The next year a vessel from Hongkong brought\\n', 'rice, mats, and tea from China. An era of lucrative trade was opened.\\n', 'The annexation of Hawaii in 1898, the addition of the Philippines at the\\n', 'same time, and the participation of American troops in the suppression\\n', 'of the Boxer rebellion in Peking in 1900, were but signs and symbols of\\n', 'American power on the Pacific.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Conservation and the Land Problem.=--The disappearance of the frontier\\n', 'also brought new and serious problems to the governments of the states\\n', 'and the nation. The people of the whole United States suddenly were\\n', 'forced to realize that there was a limit to the rich, new land to\\n', 'exploit and to the forests and minerals awaiting the ax and the pick.\\n', 'Then arose in America the questions which had long perplexed the\\n', 'countries of the Old World--the scientific use of the soils and\\n', 'conservation of natural resources. Hitherto the government had followed\\n', 'the easy path of giving away arable land and selling forest and mineral\\n', 'lands at low prices. Now it had to face far more difficult and complex\\n', 'problems. It also had to consider questions of land tenure again,\\n', 'especially if the ideal of a nation of home-owning farmers was to be\\n', 'maintained. While there was plenty of land for every man or woman who\\n', 'wanted a home on the soil, it made little difference if single landlords\\n', 'or companies got possession of millions of acres, if a hundred men in\\n', 'one western river valley owned 17,000,000 acres; but when the good land\\n', 'for small homesteads was all gone, then was raised the real issue. At\\n', 'the opening of the twentieth century the nation, which a hundred years\\n', 'before had land and natural resources apparently without limit, was\\n', 'compelled to enact law after law conserving its forests and minerals.\\n', 'Then it was that the great state of California, on the very border of\\n', 'the continent, felt constrained to enact a land settlement measure\\n', 'providing government assistance in an effort to break up large holdings\\n', 'into small lots and to make it easy for actual settlers to acquire small\\n', 'farms.

The Republicans, conscious of the fact\\n', 'that they had been a minority of the voters in 1860 and warned by the\\n', 'early loss of the House of Representatives in 1874, also moved with\\n', 'considerable prudence among the perplexing problems of the day. Again\\n', 'and again the votes in Congress showed that no clear line separated all\\n', 'the Democrats from all the Republicans. There were Republicans who\\n', 'favored tariff reductions and \"cheap money.\" There were Democrats who\\n', 'looked with partiality upon high protection or with indulgence upon the\\n', 'contraction of the currency. Only on matters relating to the coercion of\\n', 'the South was the division between the parties fairly definite; this\\n', 'could be readily accounted for on practical as well as sentimental\\n', 'grounds.\\n', '\\n', 'After all, the vague criticisms and proposals that found their way into\\n', 'the political platforms did but reflect the confusion of mind prevailing\\n', 'in the country. The fact that, out of the eighteen years between 1875\\n', 'and 1893, the Democrats held the House of Representatives for fourteen\\n', 'years while the Republicans had every President but one showed that the\\n', 'voters, like the politicians, were in a state of indecision. Hayes had a\\n', 'Democratic House during his entire term and a Democratic Senate for two\\n', 'years of the four. Cleveland was confronted by a belligerent Republican\\n', 'majority in the Senate during his first administration; and at the same\\n', 'time was supported by a Democratic majority in the House. Harrison was\\n', 'sustained by continuous Republican successes in Senatorial elections;\\n', 'but in the House he had the barest majority from 1889 to 1891 and lost\\n', 'that altogether at the election held in the middle of his term. The\\n', 'opinion of the country was evidently unsettled and fluctuating. It was\\n', 'still distracted by memories of the dead past and uncertain as to the\\n', 'trend of the future.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Nevertheless these years of muddled politics and nebulous issues proved\\n', 'to be a period in which social forces were gathering for the great\\n', 'campaign of 1896. Except for three new features--the railways, the\\n', 'trusts, and the trade unions--the subjects of debate among the people\\n', 'were the same as those that had engaged their attention since the\\n', 'foundation of the republic: the currency, the national debt, banking,\\n', 'the tariff, and taxation.\\n', '\\n', '=Debtors and the Fall in Prices.=--For many reasons the currency\\n', 'question occupied the center of interest. As of old, the farmers and\\n', 'planters of the West and South were heavily in debt to the East for\\n', 'borrowed money secured by farm mortgages; and they counted upon the sale\\n', 'of cotton, corn, wheat, and hogs to meet interest and principal when\\n', 'due. During the war, the Western farmers had been able to dispose of\\n', 'their produce at high prices and thus discharge their debts with\\n', 'comparative ease; but after the war prices declined. Wheat that sold at\\n', 'two dollars a bushel in 1865 brought sixty-four cents twenty years\\n', 'later. The meaning of this for the farmers in debt--and nearly\\n', 'three-fourths of them were in that class--can be shown by a single\\n', 'off by five hundred bushels of wheat when prices were high; whereas it\\n', 'took about fifteen hundred bushels to pay the same debt when wheat was\\n', 'at the bottom of the scale. For the farmer, it must be remembered, wheat\\n', 'was the measure of his labor, the product of his toil under the summer\\n', 'sun; and in its price he found the test of his prosperity.\\n', '\\n', '=Creditors and Falling Prices.=--To the bondholders or creditors, on the\\n', 'other hand, falling prices were clear gain. If a fifty-dollar coupon on\\n', 'a bond bought seventy or eighty bushels of wheat instead of twenty or\\n', 'thirty, the advantage to the owner of the coupon was obvious. Moreover\\n', 'the advantage seemed to him entirely just. Creditors had suffered heavy\\n', 'losses when the Civil War carried prices skyward while the interest\\n', 'rates on their old bonds remained stationary. For example, if a man had\\n', 'a $1000 bond issued before 1860 and paying interest at five per cent, he\\n', 'received fifty dollars a year from it. Before the war each dollar would\\n', 'buy a bushel of wheat; in 1865 it would only buy half a bushel. When\\n', 'prices--that is, the cost of living--began to go down, creditors\\n', 'therefore generally regarded the change with satisfaction as a return to\\n', 'normal conditions.\\n', '\\n', '=The Cause of Falling Prices.=--The fall in prices was due, no doubt, to\\n', 'many factors. Among them must be reckoned the discontinuance of\\n', 'government buying for war purposes, labor-saving farm machinery,\\n', 'immigration, and the opening of new wheat-growing regions. The currency,\\n', 'too, was an element in the situation. Whatever the cause, the\\n', 'discontented farmers believed that the way to raise prices was to issue\\n', 'more money. They viewed it as a case of supply and demand. If there was\\n', 'a small volume of currency in circulation, prices would be low; if there\\n', 'was a large volume, prices would be high. Hence they looked with favor\\n', 'upon all plans to increase the amount of money in circulation. First\\n', 'they advocated more paper notes--greenbacks--and then they turned to\\n', 'silver as the remedy. The creditors, on the other hand, naturally\\n', 'approved the reduction of the volume of currency. They wished to see the\\n', 'greenbacks withdrawn from circulation and gold--a metal more limited in\\n', 'volume than silver--made the sole basis of the national monetary system.\\n', '\\n', '=The Battle over the Greenbacks.=--The contest between these factions\\n', 'began as early as 1866. In that year, Congress enacted a law authorizing\\n', 'the Treasury to withdraw the greenbacks from circulation. The paper\\n', 'money party set up a shrill cry of protest, and kept up the fight until,\\n', 'in 1878, it forced Congress to provide for the continuous re-issue of\\n', 'the legal tender notes as they came into the Treasury in payment of\\n', 'taxes and other dues. Then could the friends of easy money rejoice:\\n', '\\n', '    \"Thou, Greenback, \\'tis of thee\\n', '     Fair money of the free,\\n', '      Of thee we sing.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Resumption of Specie Payment.=--There was, however, another side to\\n', 'this victory. The opponents of the greenbacks, unable to stop the\\n', 'circulation of paper, induced Congress to pass a law in 1875 providing\\n', 'that on and after January 1, 1879, \"the Secretary of the Treasury shall\\n', 'redeem in coin the United States legal tender notes then outstanding on\\n', 'their presentation at the office of the Assistant Treasurer of the\\n', 'United States in the City of New York in sums of not less than fifty\\n', 'dollars.\" \"The way to resume,\" John Sherman had said, \"is to resume.\"\\n', 'When the hour for redemption arrived, the Treasury was prepared with a\\n', 'large hoard of gold. \"On the appointed day,\" wrote the assistant\\n', 'secretary, \"anxiety reigned in the office of the Treasury. Hour after\\n', 'hour passed; no news from New York. Inquiry by wire showed that all was\\n', \"quiet. At the close of the day this message came: '$135,000 of notes\\n\", \"presented for coin--$400,000 of gold for notes.' That was all.\\n\", \"Resumption was accomplished with no disturbance. By five o'clock the\\n\", 'news was all over the land, and the New York bankers were sipping their\\n', 'tea in absolute safety.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Specie Problem--the Parity of Gold and Silver.=--Defeated in their\\n', 'efforts to stop \"the present suicidal and destructive policy of\\n', 'contraction,\" the advocates of an abundant currency demanded an increase\\n', 'in the volume of silver in circulation. This precipitated one of the\\n', 'sharpest political battles in American history. The issue turned on\\n', 'legal as well as economic points. The Constitution gave Congress the\\n', 'power to coin money and it forbade the states to make anything but gold\\n', 'and silver legal tender in the payment of debts. It evidently\\n', 'contemplated the use of both metals in the currency system. Such, at\\n', 'least, was the view of many eminent statesmen, including no less a\\n', 'maintaining gold and silver coins on a level which would permit them to\\n', 'circulate with equal facility. Obviously, if the gold in a gold dollar\\n', 'exceeds the value of the silver in a silver dollar on the open market,\\n', 'men will hoard gold money and leave silver money in circulation. When,\\n', 'for example, Congress in 1792 fixed the ratio of the two metals at one\\n', 'to fifteen--one ounce of gold declared worth fifteen of silver--it was\\n', 'soon found that gold had been undervalued. When again in 1834 the ratio\\n', 'was put at one to sixteen, it was found that silver was undervalued.\\n', 'Consequently the latter metal was not brought in for coinage and silver\\n', 'almost dropped out of circulation. Many a silver dollar was melted down\\n', 'by silverware factories.\\n', '\\n', '=Silver Demonetized in 1873.=--So things stood in 1873. At that time,\\n', 'Congress, in enacting a mintage law, discontinued the coinage of the\\n', 'standard silver dollar, then practically out of circulation. This act\\n', 'was denounced later by the friends of silver as \"the crime of \\'73,\" a\\n', 'conspiracy devised by the money power and secretly carried out. This\\n', 'contention the debates in Congress do not seem to sustain. In the course\\n', 'of the argument on the mint law it was distinctly said by one speaker at\\n', 'least: \"This bill provides for the making of changes in the legal tender\\n', 'coin of the country and for substituting as legal tender, coin of only\\n', 'one metal instead of two as heretofore.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Decline in the Value of Silver.=--Absorbed in the greenback\\n', 'controversy, the people apparently did not appreciate, at the time, the\\n', 'significance of the \"demonetization\" of silver; but within a few years\\n', 'several events united in making it the center of a political storm.\\n', 'Germany, having abandoned silver in 1871, steadily increased her demand\\n', 'for gold. Three years later, the countries of the Latin Union followed\\n', 'this example, thus helping to enhance the price of the yellow metal. All\\n', 'the while, new silver lodes, discovered in the Far West, were pouring\\n', 'into the market great streams of the white metal, bearing down the\\n', 'price. Then came the resumption of specie payment, which, in effect,\\n', 'placed the paper money on a gold basis. Within twenty years silver was\\n', 'worth in gold only about half the price of 1870.\\n', '\\n', 'That there had been a real decline in silver was denied by the friends\\n', 'of that metal. They alleged that gold had gone up because it had been\\n', 'given a monopoly in the coinage markets of civilized governments. This\\n', 'monopoly, they continued, was the fruit of a conspiracy against the\\n', 'people conceived by the bankers of the world. Moreover, they went on,\\n', 'the placing of the greenbacks on a gold basis had itself worked a\\n', 'contraction of the currency; it lowered the prices of labor and produce\\n', 'to the advantage of the holders of long-term investments bearing a fixed\\n', 'rate of interest. When wheat sold at sixty-four cents a bushel, their\\n', 'search for relief became desperate, and they at last concentrated their\\n', 'efforts on opening the mints of the government for the free coinage of\\n', 'silver at the ratio of sixteen to one.\\n', '\\n', '=Republicans and Democrats Divided.=--On this question both Republicans\\n', 'and Democrats were divided, the line being drawn between the East on the\\n', 'one hand and the South and West on the other, rather than between the\\n', 'speech delivered in the Senate in 1878, that, as the Constitution\\n', 'required Congress to make both gold and silver the money of the land,\\n', 'the only question left was that of fixing the ratio between them. He\\n', 'affirmed, moreover, the main contention of the silver faction that a\\n', 'reopening of the government mints of the world to silver would bring it\\n', 'up to its old relation with gold. He admitted also that their most\\n', 'going on in this country and in other countries for a single gold\\n', 'standard would, if successful, produce widespread disaster throughout\\n', 'the commercial world. The destruction of silver as money and the\\n', 'establishment of gold as the sole unit of value must have a ruinous\\n', 'effect on all forms of property, except those investments which yield a\\n', 'fixed return.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This was exactly the concession that the silver party wanted.\\n', '\"Three-fourths of the business enterprises of this country are conducted\\n', 'on borrowed capital,\" said Senator Jones, of Nevada. \"Three-fourths of\\n', 'the homes and farms that stand in the names of the actual occupants have\\n', 'been bought on time and a very large proportion of them are mortgaged\\n', 'for the payment of some part of the purchase money. Under the operation\\n', 'of a shrinkage in the volume of money, this enormous mass of borrowers,\\n', 'at the maturity of their respective debts, though nominally paying no\\n', 'more than the amount borrowed, with interest, are in reality, in the\\n', 'amount of the principal alone, returning a percentage of value greater\\n', 'than they received--more in equity than they contracted to pay.... In\\n', 'all discussions of the subject the creditors attempt to brush aside the\\n', 'equities involved by sneering at the debtors.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Silver Purchase Act (1878).=--Even before the actual resumption of\\n', 'specie payment, the advocates of free silver were a power to be reckoned\\n', 'with, particularly in the Democratic party. They had a majority in the\\n', 'House of Representatives in 1878 and they carried a silver bill through\\n', 'that chamber. Blocked by the Republican Senate they accepted a\\n', 'compromise in the Bland-Allison bill, which provided for huge monthly\\n', 'purchases of silver by the government for coinage into dollars. So\\n', 'strong was the sentiment that a two-thirds majority was mustered after\\n', 'President Hayes vetoed the measure.\\n', '\\n', 'The effect of this act, as some had anticipated, was disappointing. It\\n', 'did not stay silver on its downward course. Thereupon the silver faction\\n', 'pressed through Congress in 1886 a bill providing for the issue of paper\\n', 'certificates based on the silver accumulated in the Treasury. Still\\n', 'silver continued to fall. Then the advocates of inflation declared that\\n', 'they would be content with nothing short of free coinage at the ratio of\\n', 'sixteen to one. If the issue had been squarely presented in 1890, there\\n', 'is good reason for believing that free silver would have received a\\n', 'majority in both houses of Congress; but it was not presented.\\n', '\\n', '=The Sherman Silver Purchase Act and the Bond Sales.=--Republican\\n', 'leaders, particularly from the East, stemmed the silver tide by a\\n', 'diversion of forces. They passed the Sherman Act of 1890 providing for\\n', 'large monthly purchases of silver and for the issue of notes redeemable\\n', 'in gold or silver at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury. In\\n', 'a clause of superb ambiguity they announced that it was \"the established\\n', 'policy of the United States to maintain the two metals on a parity with\\n', 'each other upon the present legal ratio or such other ratio as may be\\n', 'provided by law.\" For a while silver was buoyed up. Then it turned once\\n', 'more on its downward course. In the meantime the Treasury was in a sad\\n', 'plight. To maintain the gold reserve, President Cleveland felt compelled\\n', 'to sell government bonds; and to his dismay he found that as soon as the\\n', 'gold was brought in at the front door of the Treasury, notes were\\n', 'presented for redemption and the gold was quickly carried out at the\\n', 'back door. Alarmed at the vicious circle thus created, he urged upon\\n', 'Congress the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. For this he was\\n', 'roundly condemned by many of his own followers who branded his conduct\\n', 'as \"treason to the party\"; but the Republicans, especially from the\\n', 'East, came to his rescue and in 1893 swept the troublesome sections of\\n', 'the law from the statute book. The anger of the silver faction knew no\\n', 'bounds, and the leaders made ready for the approaching presidential\\n', 'campaign.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Fluctuation in Tariff Policy.=--As each of the old parties was divided\\n', 'on the currency question, it is not surprising that there was some\\n', 'confusion in their ranks over the tariff. Like the silver issue, the\\n', 'tariff tended to align the manufacturing East against the agricultural\\n', 'West and South rather than to cut directly between the two parties.\\n', 'Still the Republicans on the whole stood firmly by the rates imposed\\n', 'during the Civil War. If we except the reductions of 1872 which were\\n', 'soon offset by increases, we may say that those rates were substantially\\n', 'unchanged for nearly twenty years. When a revision was brought about,\\n', 'however, it was initiated by Republican leaders. Seeing a huge surplus\\n', 'of revenue in the Treasury in 1883, they anticipated popular clamor by\\n', 'revising the tariff on the theory that it ought to be reformed by its\\n', 'friends rather than by its enemies. On the other hand, it was the\\n', 'Republicans also who enacted the McKinley tariff bill of 1890, which\\n', 'carried protection to its highest point up to that time.\\n', '\\n', 'The Democrats on their part were not all confirmed free traders or even\\n', \"advocates of tariff for revenue only. In Cleveland's first\\n\", 'administration they did attack the protective system in the House, where\\n', 'they had a majority, and in this they were vigorously supported by the\\n', 'President. The assault, however, proved to be a futile gesture for it\\n', 'was blocked by the Republicans in the Senate. When, after the sweeping\\n', 'victory of 1892, the Democrats in the House again attempted to bring\\n', 'down the tariff by the Wilson bill of 1894, they were checkmated by\\n', 'their own party colleagues in the upper chamber. In the end they were\\n', 'driven into a compromise that looked more like a McKinley than a Calhoun\\n', 'tariff. The Republicans taunted them with being \"babes in the woods.\"\\n', 'President Cleveland was so dissatisfied with the bill that he refused to\\n', 'sign it, allowing it to become a law, on the lapse of ten days, without\\n', 'his approval.\\n', '\\n', '=The Income Tax of 1894.=--The advocates of tariff reduction usually\\n', 'associated with their proposal a tax on incomes. The argument which\\n', 'they advanced in support of their program was simple. Most of the\\n', 'industries, they said, are in the East and the protective tariff which\\n', 'taxes consumers for the benefit of manufacturers is, in effect, a\\n', 'tribute laid upon the rest of the country. As an offset they offered a\\n', 'tax on large incomes; this owing to the heavy concentration of rich\\n', 'people in the East, would fall mainly upon the beneficiaries of\\n', 'protection. \"We propose,\" said one of them, \"to place a part of the\\n', 'burden upon the accumulated wealth of the country instead of placing it\\n', 'all upon the consumption of the people.\" In this spirit the sponsors of\\n', 'the Wilson tariff bill laid a tax upon all incomes of $4000 a year or\\n', 'more.\\n', '\\n', 'In taking this step, the Democrats encountered opposition in their own\\n', 'party. Senator Hill, of New York, turned fiercely upon them, exclaiming:\\n', '\"The professors with their books, the socialists with their schemes, the\\n', 'anarchists with their bombs are all instructing the people in the ...\\n', 'principles of taxation.\" Even the Eastern Republicans were hardly as\\n', 'savage in their denunciation of the tax. But all this labor was wasted.\\n', 'The next year the Supreme Court of the United States declared the income\\n', 'tax to be a direct tax, and therefore null and void because it was laid\\n', 'on incomes wherever found and not apportioned among the states according\\n', 'to population. The fact that four of the nine judges dissented from this\\n', 'decision was also an index to the diversity of opinion that divided both\\n', 'parties.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Grangers and State Regulation.=--The same uncertainty about the\\n', 'railways and trusts pervaded the ranks of the Republicans and Democrats.\\n', 'As to the railways, the first firm and consistent demand for their\\n', 'regulation came from the West. There the farmers, in the early\\n', 'seventies, having got control in state legislatures, particularly in\\n', 'Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois, enacted drastic laws prescribing the\\n', 'maximum charges which companies could make for carrying freight and\\n', 'passengers. The application of these measures, however, was limited\\n', 'because the state could not fix the rates for transporting goods and\\n', 'passengers beyond its own borders. The power of regulating interstate\\n', 'commerce, under the Constitution, belonged to Congress.\\n', '\\n', '=The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887.=--Within a few years, the movement\\n', 'which had been so effective in western legislatures appeared at\\n', 'Washington in the form of demands for the federal regulation of\\n', 'interstate rates. In 1887, the pressure became so strong that Congress\\n', 'created the interstate commerce commission and forbade many abuses on\\n', 'the part of railways; such as discriminating in charges between one\\n', 'shipper and another and granting secret rebates to favored persons. This\\n', 'law was a significant beginning; but it left the main question of\\n', 'rate-fixing untouched, much to the discontent of farmers and shippers.\\n', '\\n', '=The Sherman Anti-Trust Law of 1890.=--As in the case of the railways,\\n', 'attacks upon the trusts were first made in state legislatures, where it\\n', 'became the fashion to provide severe penalties for those who formed\\n', 'monopolies and \"conspired to enhance prices.\" Republicans and Democrats\\n', 'united in the promotion of measures of this kind. As in the case of the\\n', 'railways also, the movement to curb the trusts soon had spokesmen at\\n', 'Washington. Though Blaine had declared that \"trusts were largely a\\n', 'private affair with which neither the President nor any private citizen\\n', 'had any particular right to interfere,\" it was a Republican Congress\\n', 'that enacted in 1890 the first measure--the Sherman Anti-Trust\\n', 'Law--directed against great combinations in business. This act declared\\n', 'illegal \"every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise,\\n', 'or conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce among the several\\n', 'states or with foreign nations.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Futility of the Anti-Trust Law.=--Whether the Sherman law was\\n', 'directed against all combinations or merely those which placed an\\n', '\"unreasonable restraint\" on trade and competition was not apparent.\\n', 'Senator Platt of Connecticut, a careful statesman of the old school,\\n', 'averred: \"The questions of whether the bill would be operative, of how\\n', 'it would operate, or whether it was within the power of Congress to\\n', 'enact it, have been whistled down the wind in this Senate as idle talk\\n', 'trusts,\\' with which to go to the country.\" Whatever its purpose, its\\n', 'effect upon existing trusts and upon the formation of new combinations\\n', 'was negligible. It was practically unenforced by President Harrison and\\n', 'President Cleveland, in spite of the constant demand for harsh action\\n', 'against \"monopolies.\" It was patent that neither the Republicans nor the\\n', 'Democrats were prepared for a war on the trusts to the bitter end.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Demands of Dissenting Parties.=--From the election of 1872, when\\n', 'Horace Greeley made his ill-fated excursion into politics, onward, there\\n', 'appeared in each presidential campaign one, and sometimes two or more\\n', 'parties, stressing issues that appealed mainly to wage-earners and\\n', 'farmers. Whether they chose to call themselves Labor Reformers,\\n', 'Greenbackers, or Anti-monopolists, their slogans and their platforms all\\n', 'pointed in one direction. Even the Prohibitionists, who in 1872 started\\n', 'on their career with a single issue, the abolition of the liquor\\n', 'traffic, found themselves making declarations of faith on other matters\\n', 'and hopelessly split over the money question in 1896.\\n', '\\n', \"from the administration of Grant to the close of Cleveland's second term\\n\", 'reveals certain notions common to them all. These included among many\\n', 'others: the earliest possible payment of the national debt; regulation\\n', 'of the rates of railways and telegraph companies; repeal of the specie\\n', 'resumption act of 1875; the issue of legal tender notes by the\\n', 'government convertible into interest-bearing obligations on demand;\\n', 'unlimited coinage of silver as well as gold; a graduated inheritance\\n', 'tax; legislation to take from \"land, railroad, money, and other gigantic\\n', 'corporate monopolies ... the powers they have so corruptly and unjustly\\n', 'usurped\"; popular or direct election of United States Senators; woman\\n', 'suffrage; and a graduated income tax, \"placing the burden of government\\n', 'on those who can best afford to pay instead of laying it on the farmers\\n', 'and producers.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Criticism of the Old Parties.=--To this long program of measures the\\n', 'reformers added harsh and acrid criticism of the old parties and\\n', 'sometimes, it must be said, of established institutions of government.\\n', '\"We denounce,\" exclaimed the Labor party in 1888, \"the Democratic and\\n', 'Republican parties as hopelessly and shamelessly corrupt and by reason\\n', 'of their affiliation with monopolies equally unworthy of the suffrages\\n', 'of those who do not live upon public plunder.\" \"The United States\\n', 'Senate,\" insisted the Greenbackers, \"is a body composed largely of\\n', 'aristocratic millionaires who according to their own party papers\\n', 'generally purchased their elections in order to protect the great\\n', 'monopolies which they represent.\" Indeed, if their platforms are to be\\n', 'accepted at face value, the Greenbackers believed that the entire\\n', 'government had passed out of the hands of the people.\\n', '\\n', '=The Grangers.=--This unsparing, not to say revolutionary, criticism of\\n', 'American political life, appealed, it seems, mainly to farmers in the\\n', 'Middle West. Always active in politics, they had, before the Civil War,\\n', 'cast their lot as a rule with one or the other of the leading parties.\\n', 'In 1867, however, there grew up among them an association known as the\\n', '\"Patrons of Husbandry,\" which was destined to play a large role in the\\n', 'partisan contests of the succeeding decades. This society, which\\n', 'organized local lodges or \"granges\" on principles of secrecy and\\n', 'fraternity, was originally designed to promote in a general way the\\n', 'interests of the farmers. Its political bearings were apparently not\\n', 'grasped at first by its promoters. Yet, appealing as it did to the most\\n', 'active and independent spirits among the farmers and gathering to itself\\n', 'the strength that always comes from organization, it soon found itself\\n', 'in the hands of leaders more or less involved in politics. Where a few\\n', 'votes are marshaled together in a democracy, there is power.\\n', '\\n', '=The Greenback Party.=--The first extensive activity of the Grangers was\\n', 'connected with the attack on the railways in the Middle West which\\n', 'forced several state legislatures to reduce freight and passenger rates\\n', 'by law. At the same time, some leaders in the movement, no doubt\\n', 'emboldened by this success, launched in 1876 a new political party,\\n', 'popularly known as the Greenbackers, favoring a continued re-issue of\\n', 'the legal tenders. The beginnings were disappointing; but two years\\n', 'later, in the congressional elections, the Greenbackers swept whole\\n', 'sections of the country. Their candidates polled more than a million\\n', 'votes and fourteen of them were returned to the House of\\n', 'Representatives. To all outward signs a new and formidable party had\\n', 'entered the lists.\\n', '\\n', 'The sanguine hopes of the leaders proved to be illusory. The quiet\\n', 'operations of the resumption act the following year, a revival of\\n', 'industry from a severe panic which had set in during 1873, the Silver\\n', 'Purchase Act, and the re-issue of Greenbacks cut away some of the\\n', 'grounds of agitation. There was also a diversion of forces to the silver\\n', 'faction which had a substantial support in the silver mine owners of the\\n', 'West. At all events the Greenback vote fell to about 300,000 in the\\n', 'party gave up the ghost, its sponsors returning to their former\\n', 'allegiance or sulking in their tents.\\n', '\\n', '=The Rise of the Populist Party.=--Those leaders of the old parties who\\n', 'now looked for a happy future unvexed by new factions were doomed to\\n', 'disappointment. The funeral of the Greenback party was hardly over\\n', 'before there arose two other political specters in the agrarian\\n', \"sections: the National Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union,\\n\", \"particularly strong in the South and West; and the Farmers' Alliance,\\n\", 'operating in the North. By 1890 the two orders claimed over three\\n', 'million members. As in the case of the Grangers many years before, the\\n', 'leaders among them found an easy way into politics. In 1892 they held a\\n', 'convention, nominated a candidate for President, and adopted the name of\\n', '\"People\\'s Party,\" from which they were known as Populists. Their\\n', 'platform, in every line, breathed a spirit of radicalism. They declared\\n', 'that \"the newspapers are largely subsidized or muzzled; public opinion\\n', 'silenced; business prostrate; our homes covered with mortgages; and the\\n', 'land concentrating in the hands of capitalists.... The fruits of the\\n', 'toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a\\n', 'few.\" Having delivered this sweeping indictment, the Populists put\\n', 'forward their remedies: the free coinage of silver, a graduated income\\n', 'tax, postal savings banks, and government ownership of railways and\\n', 'telegraphs. At the same time they approved the initiative, referendum,\\n', 'and popular election of Senators, and condemned the use of federal\\n', 'troops in labor disputes. On this platform, the Populists polled over a\\n', 'million votes, captured twenty-two presidential electors, and sent a\\n', 'powerful delegation to Congress.\\n', '\\n', '=Industrial Distress Augments Unrest.=--The four years intervening\\n', 'between the campaign of 1892 and the next presidential election brought\\n', 'forth many events which aggravated the ill-feeling expressed in the\\n', 'portentous platform of Populism. Cleveland, a consistent enemy of free\\n', 'silver, gave his powerful support to the gold standard and insisted on\\n', 'the repeal of the Silver Purchase Act, thus alienating an increasing\\n', 'number of his own party. In 1893 a grave industrial crisis fell upon the\\n', 'land: banks and business houses went into bankruptcy with startling\\n', 'rapidity; factories were closed; idle men thronged the streets hunting\\n', 'for work; and the prices of wheat and corn dropped to a ruinous level.\\n', 'car works in Chicago spread to the railways. Disorders ensued. President\\n', 'Altgeld, dispatched troops to the scene of action. The United States\\n', 'district court at Chicago issued an injunction forbidding the president\\n', 'with the transmission of the mails or interstate commerce in any form.\\n', 'For refusing to obey the order, Debs was arrested and imprisoned. With\\n', 'federal troops in possession of the field, with their leader in jail,\\n', 'the strikers gave up the battle, defeated but not subdued. To cap the\\n', 'climax the Supreme Court of the United States, the following year (1895)\\n', 'declared null and void the income tax law just enacted by Congress, thus\\n', 'fanning the flames of Populist discontent all over the West and South.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Conservative Men Alarmed.=--Men of conservative thought and leaning in\\n', 'both parties were by this time thoroughly disturbed. They looked upon\\n', 'the rise of Populism and the growth of labor disputes as the signs of a\\n', 'revolutionary spirit, indeed nothing short of a menace to American\\n', 'institutions and ideals. The income tax law of 1894, exclaimed the\\n', 'speech before the Supreme Court, \"is communistic in its purposes and\\n', 'tendencies and is defended here upon principles as communistic,\\n', 'addressed to any political assembly in the world.\" Mr. Justice Field in\\n', 'the name of the Court replied: \"The present assault upon capital is but\\n', 'the beginning. It will be but the stepping stone to others larger and\\n', 'more sweeping till our political conditions will become a war of the\\n', 'poor against the rich.\" In declaring the income tax unconstitutional, he\\n', 'believed that he was but averting greater evils lurking under its guise.\\n', 'As for free silver, nearly all conservative men were united in calling\\n', 'it a measure of confiscation and repudiation; an effort of the debtors\\n', 'to pay their obligations with money worth fifty cents on the dollar; the\\n', 'climax of villainies openly defended; a challenge to law, order, and\\n', 'honor.\\n', '\\n', '=The Republicans Come Out for the Gold Standard.=--It was among the\\n', 'Republicans that this opinion was most widely shared and firmly held. It\\n', 'was they who picked up the gauge thrown down by the Populists, though a\\n', 'host of Democrats, like Cleveland and Hill of New York, also battled\\n', 'against the growing Populist defection in Democratic ranks. When the\\n', 'Republican national convention assembled in 1896, the die was soon\\n', 'cast; a declaration of opposition to free silver save by international\\n', 'agreement was carried by a vote of eight to one. The Republican party,\\n', 'to use the vigorous language of Mr. Lodge, arrayed itself against \"not\\n', 'only that organized failure, the Democratic party, but all the wandering\\n', 'forces of political chaos and social disorder ... in these bitter times\\n', 'when the forces of disorder are loose and the wreckers with their false\\n', 'lights gather at the shore to lure the ship of state upon the rocks.\"\\n', 'Yet it is due to historic truth to state that McKinley, whom the\\n', 'Republicans nominated, had voted in Congress for the free coinage of\\n', 'silver, was widely known as a bimetallist, and was only with difficulty\\n', 'persuaded to accept the unequivocal indorsement of the gold standard\\n', 'which was pressed upon him by his counselors. Having accepted it,\\n', 'however, he proved to be a valiant champion, though his major interest\\n', 'was undoubtedly in the protective tariff. To him nothing was more\\n', 'reprehensible than attempts \"to array class against class, \\'the classes\\n', \"against the masses,' section against section, labor against capital,\\n\", '\\'the poor against the rich,\\' or interest against interest.\" Such was the\\n', 'language of his acceptance speech. The whole program of Populism he now\\n', 'viewed as a \"sudden, dangerous, and revolutionary assault upon law and\\n', 'order.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Democratic Convention at Chicago.=--Never, save at the great\\n', 'disruption on the eve of the Civil War, did a Democratic national\\n', 'convention display more feeling than at Chicago in 1896. From the\\n', 'opening prayer to the last motion before the house, every act, every\\n', 'speech, every scene, every resolution evoked passions and sowed\\n', 'dissensions. Departing from long party custom, it voted down in anger a\\n', 'proposal to praise the administration of the Democratic President,\\n', 'Cleveland. When the platform with its radical planks, including free\\n', 'silver, was reported, a veritable storm broke. Senator Hill, trembling\\n', 'with emotion, protested against the departure from old tests of\\n', 'Democratic allegiance; against principles that must drive out of the\\n', 'party men who had grown gray in its service; against revolutionary,\\n', 'unwise, and unprecedented steps in the history of the party. Senator\\n', 'Vilas of Wisconsin, in great fervor, avowed that there was no difference\\n', 'in principle between the free coinage of silver--\"the confiscation of\\n', 'one-half of the credits of the nation for the benefit of debtors\"--and\\n', 'communism itself--\"a universal distribution of property.\" In the triumph\\n', 'of that cause he saw the beginning of \"the overthrow of all law, all\\n', 'justice, all security and repose in the social order.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Crown of Thorns Speech.=--The champions of free silver replied in\\n', 'strident tones. They accused the gold advocates of being the aggressors\\n', 'who had assailed the labor and the homes of the people. William Jennings\\n', 'Bryan, of Nebraska, voiced their sentiments in a memorable oration. He\\n', 'declared that their cause \"was as holy as the cause of liberty--the\\n', 'cause of humanity.\" He exclaimed that the contest was between the idle\\n', 'holders of idle capital and the toiling millions. Then he named those\\n', 'for whom he spoke--the wage-earner, the country lawyer, the small\\n', 'merchant, the farmer, and the miner. \"The man who is employed for wages\\n', 'is as much a business man as his employer. The attorney in a country\\n', 'town is as much a business man as the corporation counsel in a great\\n', 'metropolis. The merchant at the cross roads store is as much a business\\n', 'man as the merchant of New York. The farmer ... is as much a business\\n', 'man as the man who goes upon the board of trade and bets upon the price\\n', 'of grain. The miners who go a thousand feet into the earth or climb two\\n', 'thousand feet upon the cliffs ... are as much business men as the few\\n', 'financial magnates who in a back room corner the money of the world....\\n', 'It is for these that we speak. We do not come as aggressors. Ours is not\\n', 'a war of conquest. We are fighting in defense of our homes, our\\n', 'families, and our posterity. We have petitioned and our petitions have\\n', 'been scorned. We have entreated and our entreaties have been\\n', 'disregarded. We have begged and they have mocked when our calamity came.\\n', 'We beg no longer; we entreat no more; we petition no more. We defy\\n', 'them.... We shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to\\n', \"them, 'You shall not press upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns.\\n\", 'You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\\'\"\\n', '\\n', '=Bryan Nominated.=--In all the history of national conventions never had\\n', 'an orator so completely swayed a multitude; not even Yancey in his\\n', 'memorable plea in the Charleston convention of 1860 when, with grave and\\n', 'moving eloquence, he espoused the Southern cause against the impending\\n', 'fates. The delegates, after cheering Mr. Bryan until they could cheer no\\n', 'more, tore the standards from the floor and gathered around the Nebraska\\n', 'delegation to renew the deafening applause. The platform as reported was\\n', 'carried by a vote of two to one and the young orator from the West,\\n', \"hailed as America's Tiberius Gracchus, was nominated as the Democratic\\n\", 'candidate for President. The South and West had triumphed over the East.\\n', 'The division was sectional, admittedly sectional--the old combination of\\n', 'power which Calhoun had so anxiously labored to build up a century\\n', 'earlier. The Gold Democrats were repudiated in terms which were clear to\\n', 'ticket, held a convention at Indianapolis where, with the sanction of\\n', 'Cleveland, they nominated candidates of their own and endorsed the gold\\n', 'standard in a forlorn hope.\\n', '\\n', '=The Democratic Platform.=--It was to the call from Chicago that the\\n', 'Democrats gave heed and the Republicans made answer. The platform on\\n', 'which Mr. Bryan stood, unlike most party manifestoes, was explicit in\\n', 'its language and its appeal. It denounced the practice of allowing\\n', 'national banks to issue notes intended to circulate as money on the\\n', 'ground that it was \"in derogation of the Constitution,\" recalling\\n', \"Jackson's famous attack on the Bank in 1832. It declared that tariff\\n\", 'duties should be laid \"for the purpose of revenue\"--Calhoun\\'s doctrine.\\n', 'In demanding the free coinage of silver, it recurred to the practice\\n', 'abandoned in 1873. The income tax came next on the program. The platform\\n', 'alleged that the law of 1894, passed by a Democratic Congress, was \"in\\n', 'strict pursuance of the uniform decisions of the Supreme Court for\\n', 'nearly a hundred years,\" and then hinted that the decision annulling the\\n', 'law might be reversed by the same body \"as it may hereafter be\\n', 'constituted.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The appeal to labor voiced by Mr. Bryan in his \"crown of thorns\" speech\\n', 'was reinforced in the platform. \"As labor creates the wealth of the\\n', 'country,\" ran one plank, \"we demand the passage of such laws as may be\\n', 'necessary to protect it in all its rights.\" Referring to the recent\\n', 'Pullman strike, the passions of which had not yet died away, the\\n', 'platform denounced \"arbitrary interference by federal authorities in\\n', 'local affairs as a violation of the Constitution of the United States\\n', 'against \"government by injunction as a new and highly dangerous form of\\n', 'oppression by which federal judges, in contempt of the laws of states\\n', 'and rights of citizens, become at once legislators, judges, and\\n', 'executioners.\" The remedy advanced was a federal law assuring trial by\\n', 'jury in all cases of contempt in labor disputes. Having made this\\n', 'declaration of faith, the Democrats, with Mr. Bryan at the head, raised\\n', 'their standard of battle.\\n', '\\n', '=The Heated Campaign.=--The campaign which ensued outrivaled in the\\n', 'range of its educational activities and the bitterness of its tone all\\n', 'other political conflicts in American history, not excepting the fateful\\n', 'struggle of 1860. Immense sums of money were contributed to the funds of\\n', 'both parties. Railway, banking, and other corporations gave generously\\n', 'to the Republicans; the silver miners, less lavishly but with the same\\n', 'anxiety, supported the Democrats. The country was flooded with\\n', 'pamphlets, posters, and handbills. Every public forum, from the great\\n', 'auditoriums of the cities to the \"red schoolhouses\" on the countryside,\\n', 'was occupied by the opposing forces.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Bryan took the stump himself, visiting all parts of the country in\\n', 'special trains and addressing literally millions of people in the open\\n', 'air. Mr. McKinley chose the older and more formal plan. He received\\n', 'delegations at his home in Canton and discussed the issues of the\\n', 'campaign from his front porch, leaving to an army of well-organized\\n', 'orators the task of reaching the people in their home towns. Parades,\\n', 'processions, and monster demonstrations filled the land with politics.\\n', 'Whole states were polled in advance by the Republicans and the doubtful\\n', 'voters personally visited by men equipped with arguments and literature.\\n', 'Manufacturers, frightened at the possibility of disordered public\\n', 'credit, announced that they would close their doors if the Democrats won\\n', 'the election. Men were dismissed from public and private places on\\n', 'account of their political views, one eminent college president being\\n', 'forced out for advocating free silver. The language employed by\\n', 'impassioned and embittered speakers on both sides roused the public to a\\n', 'state of frenzy, once more showing the lengths to which men could go in\\n', 'personal and political abuse.\\n', '\\n', '=The Republican Victory.=--The verdict of the nation was decisive.\\n', 'McKinley received 271 of the 447 electoral votes, and 7,111,000 popular\\n', \"votes as against Bryan's 6,509,000. The congressional elections were\\n\", 'equally positive although, on account of the composition of the Senate,\\n', 'the \"hold-over\" Democrats and Populists still enjoyed a power out of\\n', 'proportion to their strength as measured at the polls. Even as it was,\\n', 'the Republicans got full control of both houses--a dominion of the\\n', 'entire government which they were to hold for fourteen years--until the\\n', \"second half of Mr. Taft's administration, when they lost possession of\\n\", 'the House of Representatives. The yoke of indecision was broken. The\\n', 'party of sound finance and protective tariffs set out upon its lease of\\n', 'power with untroubled assurance.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Gold Standard and the Tariff.=--Yet strange as it may seem, the\\n', 'Republicans did not at once enact legislation making the gold dollar the\\n', 'standard for the national currency. Not until 1900 did they take that\\n', 'positive step. In his first inaugural President McKinley, as if still\\n', 'uncertain in his own mind or fearing a revival of the contest just\\n', 'closed, placed the tariff, not the money question, in the forefront.\\n', '\"The people have decided,\" he said, \"that such legislation should be had\\n', 'as will give ample protection and encouragement to the industries and\\n', 'development of our country.\" Protection for American industries,\\n', 'therefore, he urged, is the task before Congress. \"With adequate revenue\\n', 'secured, but not until then, we can enter upon changes in our fiscal\\n', 'laws.\" As the Republicans had only forty-six of the ninety Senators, and\\n', 'at least four of them were known advocates of free silver, the\\n', 'discretion exercised by the President in selecting the tariff for\\n', 'congressional debate was the better part of valor.\\n', '\\n', 'Dingley, whose name was given to the bill, a tariff measure levying the\\n', 'highest rates yet laid in the history of American imposts was prepared\\n', 'and driven through the House of Representatives. The opposition\\n', 'encountered in the Senate, especially from the West, was overcome by\\n', 'concessions in favor of that section; but the duties on sugar, tin,\\n', 'steel, lumber, hemp, and in fact all of the essential commodities\\n', 'handled by combinations and trusts, were materially raised.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Growth of Combinations.=--The years that followed the enactment of the\\n', 'Dingley law were, whatever the cause, the most prosperous the country\\n', 'had witnessed for many a decade. Industries of every kind were soon\\n', 'running full blast; labor was employed; commerce spread more swiftly\\n', 'than ever to the markets of the world. Coincident with this progress was\\n', 'the organization of the greatest combinations and trusts the world had\\n', 'yet seen. In 1899 the smelters formed a trust with a capital of\\n', '$65,000,000; in the same year the Standard Oil Company with a capital of\\n', 'over one hundred millions took the place of the old trust; and the\\n', 'Copper Trust was incorporated under the laws of New Jersey, its par\\n', 'later the National Sugar Refining Company, of New Jersey, started with a\\n', 'capital of $90,000,000, adopting the policy of issuing to the\\n', 'stockholders no public statement of its earnings or financial condition.\\n', 'Before another twelvemonth had elapsed all previous corporate financing\\n', 'was reduced to small proportions by the flotation of the United States\\n', 'Steel Corporation with a capital of more than a billion dollars, an\\n', 'enterprise set in motion by the famous Morgan banking house of New York.\\n', '\\n', 'In nearly all these gigantic undertakings, the same great leaders in\\n', 'finance were more or less intimately associated. To use the language of\\n', 'an eminent authority: \"They are all allied and intertwined by their\\n', 'various mutual interests. For instance, the Pennsylvania Railroad\\n', 'interests are on the one hand allied with the Vanderbilts and on the\\n', 'other with the Rockefellers. The Vanderbilts are closely allied with the\\n', 'Morgan group.... Viewed as a whole we find the dominating influences in\\n', 'the trusts to be made up of a network of large and small capitalists,\\n', 'many allied to one another by ties of more or less importance, but all\\n', 'being appendages to or parts of the greater groups which are themselves\\n', 'dependent on and allied with the two mammoth or Rockefeller and Morgan\\n', 'groups. These two mammoth groups jointly ... constitute the heart of the\\n', 'business and commercial life of the nation.\" Such was the picture of\\n', 'triumphant business enterprise drawn by a financier within a few years\\n', 'after the memorable campaign of 1896.\\n', '\\n', 'America had become one of the first workshops of the world. It was, by\\n', 'virtue of the closely knit organization of its business and finance, one\\n', 'of the most powerful and energetic leaders in the struggle of the giants\\n', 'for the business of the earth.

Perhaps at this late day, it is useless to\\n', 'protest against the currency of the idea. Nevertheless, the truth is\\n', 'that from the fateful moment in March, 1775, when Edmund Burke unfolded\\n', 'to his colleagues in the British Parliament the resources of an\\n', 'invincible America, down to the settlement at Versailles in 1919 closing\\n', 'the drama of the World War, this nation has been a world power,\\n', 'influencing by its example, by its institutions, by its wealth, trade,\\n', 'and arms the course of international affairs.

Only a\\n', 'little while after the civil conflict came to a close, it was called\\n', 'upon to deal with a dangerous situation created in Mexico by the\\n', 'had fallen into disorder through the strife of the Liberal and the\\n', 'Clerical parties; the President asked for authority to use American\\n', 'troops to bring to a peaceful haven \"a wreck upon the ocean, drifting\\n', 'about as she is impelled by different factions.\" Our own domestic crisis\\n', 'then intervened.\\n', '\\n', 'Observing the United States heavily involved in its own problems, the\\n', 'great powers, England, France, and Spain, decided in the autumn of 1861\\n', 'to take a hand themselves in restoring order in Mexico. They entered\\n', 'into an agreement to enforce the claims of their citizens against Mexico\\n', 'and to protect their subjects residing in that republic. They invited\\n', 'the United States to join them, and, on meeting a polite refusal, they\\n', 'prepared for a combined military and naval demonstration on their own\\n', 'account. In the midst of this action England and Spain, discovering the\\n', 'sinister purposes of Napoleon, withdrew their troops and left the field\\n', 'to him.\\n', '\\n', 'The French Emperor, it was well known, looked with jealousy upon the\\n', 'growth of the United States and dreamed of establishing in the Western\\n', 'hemisphere an imperial power to offset the American republic.\\n', 'Intervention to collect debts was only a cloak for his deeper designs.\\n', 'Throwing off that guise in due time, he made the Archduke Maximilian, a\\n', 'brother of the ruler of Austria, emperor in Mexico, and surrounded his\\n', 'throne by French soldiers, in spite of all protests.\\n', '\\n', 'This insolent attack upon the Mexican republic, deeply resented in the\\n', 'United States, was allowed to drift in its course until 1865. At that\\n', 'juncture General Sheridan was dispatched to the Mexican border with a\\n', 'large armed force; General Grant urged the use of the American army to\\n', 'expel the French from this continent. The Secretary of State, Seward,\\n', 'counseled negotiation first, and, applying the Monroe Doctrine, was able\\n', 'of French arms, the sham empire in Mexico collapsed like a house of\\n', 'cards and the unhappy Maximilian, the victim of French ambition and\\n', 'intrigue, met his death at the hands of a Mexican firing squad.\\n', '\\n', '=Alaska Purchased.=--The Mexican affair had not been brought to a close\\n', 'before the Department of State was busy with negotiations which resulted\\n', 'in the purchase of Alaska from Russia. The treaty of cession, signed on\\n', 'March 30, 1867, added to the United States a domain of nearly six\\n', 'hundred thousand square miles, a territory larger than Texas and nearly\\n', 'three-fourths the size of the Louisiana purchase. Though it was a\\n', 'distant colony separated from our continental domain by a thousand miles\\n', 'of water, no question of \"imperialism\" or \"colonization foreign to\\n', 'American doctrines\" seems to have been raised at the time. The treaty\\n', 'was ratified promptly by the Senate. The purchase price, $7,200,000, was\\n', 'voted by the House of Representatives after the display of some\\n', 'resentment against a system that compelled it to appropriate money to\\n', 'fulfill an obligation which it had no part in making. Seward, who\\n', 'formulated the treaty, rejoiced, as he afterwards said, that he had kept\\n', 'Alaska out of the hands of England.\\n', '\\n', '=American Interest in the Caribbean.=--Having achieved this diplomatic\\n', 'triumph, Seward turned to the increase of American power in another\\n', 'direction. He negotiated, with Denmark, a treaty providing for the\\n', 'purchase of the islands of St. John and St. Thomas in the West Indies,\\n', 'strategic points in the Caribbean for sea power. This project, long\\n', 'afterward brought to fruition by other men, was defeated on this\\n', 'occasion by the refusal of the Senate to ratify the treaty. Evidently it\\n', 'was not yet prepared to exercise colonial dominion over other races.\\n', '\\n', 'Undaunted by the misadventure in Caribbean policies, President Grant\\n', 'warmly advocated the acquisition of Santo Domingo. This little republic\\n', 'had long been in a state of general disorder. In 1869 a treaty of\\n', 'annexation was concluded with its president. The document Grant\\n', 'transmitted to the Senate with his cordial approval, only to have it\\n', 'rejected. Not at all changed in his opinion by the outcome of his\\n', 'effort, he continued to urge the subject of annexation. Even in his last\\n', 'message to Congress he referred to it, saying that time had only proved\\n', 'the wisdom of his early course. The addition of Santo Domingo to the\\n', 'American sphere of protection was the work of a later generation. The\\n', 'State Department, temporarily checked, had to bide its time.\\n', '\\n', '=The _Alabama_ Claims Arbitrated.=--Indeed, it had in hand a far more\\n', 'serious matter, a vexing issue that grew out of Civil War diplomacy. The\\n', 'British government, as already pointed out in other connections, had\\n', 'permitted Confederate cruisers, including the famous _Alabama_, built in\\n', 'British ports, to escape and prey upon the commerce of the Northern\\n', 'states. This action, denounced at the time by our government as a grave\\n', 'breach of neutrality as well as a grievous injury to American citizens,\\n', 'led first to remonstrances and finally to repeated claims for damages\\n', 'done to American ships and goods. For a long time Great Britain was\\n', 'firm. Her foreign secretary denied all obligations in the premises,\\n', 'adding somewhat curtly that \"he wished to say once for all that Her\\n', \"Majesty's government disclaimed any responsibility for the losses and\\n\", 'hoped that they had made their position perfectly clear.\" Still\\n', 'President Grant was not persuaded that the door of diplomacy, though\\n', 'closed, was barred. Hamilton Fish, his Secretary of State, renewed the\\n', 'demand. Finally he secured from the British government in 1871 the\\n', 'treaty of Washington providing for the arbitration not merely of the\\n', '_Alabama_ and other claims but also all points of serious controversy\\n', 'between the two countries.\\n', '\\n', 'The tribunal of arbitration thus authorized sat at Geneva in\\n', 'Switzerland, and after a long and careful review of the arguments on\\n', 'both sides awarded to the United States the lump sum of $15,500,000 to\\n', 'be distributed among the American claimants. The damages thus allowed\\n', 'were large, unquestionably larger than strict justice required and it is\\n', 'not surprising that the decision excited much adverse comment in\\n', 'England. Nevertheless, the prompt payment by the British government\\n', 'swept away at once a great cloud of ill-feeling in America. Moreover,\\n', 'the spectacle of two powerful nations choosing the way of peaceful\\n', 'arbitration to settle an angry dispute seemed a happy, if illusory, omen\\n', 'of a modern method for avoiding the arbitrament of war.\\n', '\\n', '=Samoa.=--If the Senate had its doubts at first about the wisdom of\\n', 'acquiring strategic points for naval power in distant seas, the same\\n', 'could not be said of the State Department or naval officers. In 1872\\n', 'Commander Meade, of the United States navy, alive to the importance of\\n', 'coaling stations even in mid-ocean, made a commercial agreement with the\\n', 'chief of Tutuila, one of the Samoan Islands, far below the equator, in\\n', 'the southern Pacific, nearer to Australia than to California. This\\n', 'agreement, providing among other things for our use of the harbor of\\n', 'Pago Pago as a naval base, was six years later changed into a formal\\n', 'treaty ratified by the Senate.\\n', '\\n', 'Such enterprise could not escape the vigilant eyes of England and\\n', 'Germany, both mindful of the course of the sea power in history. The\\n', 'German emperor, seizing as a pretext a quarrel between his consul in the\\n', 'islands and a native king, laid claim to an interest in the Samoan\\n', 'group. England, aware of the dangers arising from German outposts in the\\n', 'southern seas so near to Australia, was not content to stand aside. So\\n', 'it happened that all three countries sent battleships to the Samoan\\n', 'waters, threatening a crisis that was fortunately averted by friendly\\n', 'settlement. If, as is alleged, Germany entertained a notion of\\n', 'challenging American sea power then and there, the presence of British\\n', 'ships must have dispelled that dream.\\n', '\\n', 'The result of the affair was a tripartite agreement by which the three\\n', 'powers in 1889 undertook a protectorate over the islands. But joint\\n', 'control proved unsatisfactory. There was constant friction between the\\n', 'Germans and the English. The spheres of authority being vague and open\\n', 'to dispute, the plan had to be abandoned at the end of ten years.\\n', 'England withdrew altogether, leaving to Germany all the islands except\\n', 'Tutuila, which was ceded outright to the United States. Thus one of the\\n', 'finest harbors in the Pacific, to the intense delight of the American\\n', 'navy, passed permanently under American dominion. Another triumph in\\n', 'diplomacy was set down to the credit of the State Department.\\n', '\\n', '=Cleveland and the Venezuela Affair.=--In the relations with South\\n', 'America, as well as in those with the distant Pacific, the diplomacy of\\n', 'the government at Washington was put to the test. For some time it had\\n', 'been watching a dispute between England and Venezuela over the western\\n', 'boundary of British Guiana and, on an appeal from Venezuela, it had\\n', 'taken a lively interest in the contest. In 1895 President Cleveland saw\\n', 'that Great Britain would yield none of her claims. After hearing the\\n', 'note none too conciliatory, asked the British government whether it was\\n', 'willing to arbitrate the points in controversy. This inquiry he\\n', 'accompanied by a warning to the effect that the United States could not\\n', 'permit any European power to contest its mastery in this hemisphere.\\n', '\"The United States,\" said the Secretary, \"is practically sovereign on\\n', 'this continent and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it\\n', 'confines its interposition.... Its infinite resources, combined with its\\n', 'isolated position, render it master of the situation and practically\\n', 'invulnerable against any or all other powers.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The reply evoked from the British government by this strong statement\\n', 'was firm and clear. The Monroe Doctrine, it said, even if not so widely\\n', 'stretched by interpretation, was not binding in international law; the\\n', 'dispute with Venezuela was a matter of interest merely to the parties\\n', 'involved; and arbitration of the question was impossible. This response\\n', \"called forth President Cleveland's startling message of 1895. He asked\\n\", 'Congress to create a commission authorized to ascertain by researches\\n', 'the true boundary between Venezuela and British Guiana. He added that it\\n', 'would be the duty of this country \"to resist by every means in its\\n', 'power, as a willful aggression upon its rights and interests, the\\n', 'appropriation by Great Britain of any lands or the exercise of\\n', 'governmental jurisdiction over any territory which, after investigation,\\n', 'we have determined of right belongs to Venezuela.\" The serious character\\n', 'of this statement he thoroughly understood. He declared that he was\\n', 'conscious of his responsibilities, intimating that war, much as it was\\n', 'to be deplored, was not comparable to \"a supine submission to wrong and\\n', 'injustice and the consequent loss of national self-respect and honor.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The note of defiance which ran through this message, greeted by shrill\\n', 'cries of enthusiasm in many circles, was viewed in other quarters as a\\n', 'portent of war. Responsible newspapers in both countries spoke of an\\n', 'armed settlement of the dispute as inevitable. Congress created the\\n', 'commission and appropriated money for the investigation; a body of\\n', 'learned men was appointed to determine the merits of the conflicting\\n', 'boundary claims. The British government, deaf to the clamor of the\\n', 'bellicose section of the London press, deplored the incident,\\n', 'courteously replied in the affirmative to a request for assistance in\\n', 'the search for evidence, and finally agreed to the proposition that the\\n', 'issue be submitted to arbitration. The outcome of this somewhat perilous\\n', 'dispute contributed not a little to Cleveland\\'s reputation as \"a\\n', 'sterling representative of the true American spirit.\" This was not\\n', 'diminished when the tribunal of arbitration found that Great Britain was\\n', 'on the whole right in her territorial claims against Venezuela.\\n', '\\n', '=The Annexation of Hawaii.=--While engaged in the dangerous Venezuela\\n', 'controversy, President Cleveland was compelled by a strange turn in\\n', 'events to consider the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands in the\\n', 'mid-Pacific. For more than half a century American missionaries had been\\n', 'active in converting the natives to the Christian faith and enterprising\\n', 'American business men had been developing the fertile sugar plantations.\\n', 'Both the Department of State and the Navy Department were fully\\n', 'conscious of the strategic relation of the islands to the growth of sea\\n', 'power and watched with anxiety any developments likely to bring them\\n', 'under some other Dominion.\\n', '\\n', 'The country at large was indifferent, however, until 1893, when a\\n', 'revolution, headed by Americans, broke out, ending in the overthrow of\\n', 'the native government, the abolition of the primitive monarchy, and the\\n', 'retirement of Queen Liliuokalani to private life. This crisis, a\\n', 'repetition of the Texas affair in a small theater, was immediately\\n', 'followed by a demand from the new Hawaiian government for annexation to\\n', 'the United States. President Harrison looked with favor on the proposal,\\n', 'negotiated the treaty of annexation, and laid it before the Senate for\\n', 'approval. There it still rested when his term of office was brought to a\\n', 'close.\\n', '\\n', \"Harrison's successor, Cleveland, it was well known, had doubts about the\\n\", 'propriety of American action in Hawaii. For the purpose of making an\\n', 'inquiry into the matter, he sent a special commissioner to the islands.\\n', 'On the basis of the report of his agent, Cleveland came to the\\n', 'conclusion that \"the revolution in the island kingdom had been\\n', 'accomplished by the improper use of the armed forces of the United\\n', 'States and that the wrong should be righted by a restoration of the\\n', 'queen to her throne.\" Such being his matured conviction, though the\\n', 'facts upon which he rested it were warmly controverted, he could do\\n', 'nothing but withdraw the treaty from the Senate and close the incident.\\n', '\\n', 'To the Republicans this sharp and cavalier disposal of their plans,\\n', 'carried out in a way that impugned the motives of a Republican\\n', 'President, was nothing less than \"a betrayal of American interests.\" In\\n', 'their platform of 1896 they made clear their position: \"Our foreign\\n', 'policy should be at all times firm, vigorous, and dignified and all our\\n', 'interests in the Western hemisphere carefully watched and guarded. The\\n', 'Hawaiian Islands should be controlled by the United States and no\\n', 'foreign power should be permitted to interfere with them.\" There was no\\n', 'mistaking this view of the issue. As the vote in the election gave\\n', 'popular sanction to Republican policies, Congress by a joint resolution,\\n', 'passed on July 6, 1898, annexed the islands to the United States and\\n', 'later conferred upon them the ordinary territorial form of government.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Early American Relations with Cuba.=--The year that brought Hawaii\\n', 'finally under the American flag likewise drew to a conclusion another\\n', 'long controversy over a similar outpost in the Atlantic, one of the last\\n', 'remnants of the once glorious Spanish empire--the island of Cuba.\\n', '\\n', 'For a century the Department of State had kept an anxious eye upon this\\n', 'base of power, knowing full well that both France and England, already\\n', 'well established in the West Indies, had their attention also fixed upon\\n', 'Cuba. In the administration of President Fillmore they had united in\\n', 'proposing to the United States a tripartite treaty guaranteeing Spain in\\n', 'her none too certain ownership. This proposal, squarely rejected,\\n', 'furnished the occasion for a statement of American policy which stood\\n', 'the test of all the years that followed; namely, that the affair was one\\n', 'between Spain and the United States alone.\\n', '\\n', 'In that long contest in the United States for the balance of power\\n', 'between the North and South, leaders in the latter section often thought\\n', 'of bringing Cuba into the union to offset the free states. An\\n', 'opportunity to announce their purposes publicly was afforded in 1854 by\\n', 'a controversy over the seizure of an American ship by Cuban authorities.\\n', 'On that occasion three American ministers abroad, stationed at Madrid,\\n', 'Paris, and London respectively, held a conference and issued the\\n', 'celebrated \"Ostend Manifesto.\" They united in declaring that Cuba, by\\n', 'her geographical position, formed a part of the United States, that\\n', 'possession by a foreign power was inimical to American interests, and\\n', 'that an effort should be made to purchase the island from Spain. In case\\n', 'the owner refused to sell, they concluded, with a menacing flourish, \"by\\n', 'every law, human and divine, we shall be justified in wresting it from\\n', 'Spain if we possess the power.\" This startling proclamation to the world\\n', 'was promptly disowned by the United States government.\\n', '\\n', '[Illustration: _=An old cartoon.=_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'France.\"]\\n', '\\n', '=Revolutions in Cuba.=--For nearly twenty years afterwards the Cuban\\n', 'question rested. Then it was revived in another form during President\\n', \"Grant's administrations, when the natives became engaged in a\\n\", 'destructive revolt against Spanish officials. For ten years--1868-78--a\\n', 'guerrilla warfare raged in the island. American citizens, by virtue of\\n', 'their ancient traditions of democracy, naturally sympathized with a war\\n', 'for independence and self-government. Expeditions to help the insurgents\\n', 'were fitted out secretly in American ports. Arms and supplies were\\n', 'smuggled into Cuba. American soldiers of fortune joined their ranks. The\\n', 'enforcement of neutrality against the friends of Cuban independence, no\\n', 'pleasing task for a sympathetic President, the protection of American\\n', 'lives and property in the revolutionary area, and similar matters kept\\n', 'our government busy with Cuba for a whole decade.\\n', '\\n', 'revolutionary movement. The contest between the rebels and the Spanish\\n', 'troops, marked by extreme cruelty and a total disregard for life and\\n', 'property, exceeded all bounds of decency, and once more raised the old\\n', \"questions that had tormented Grant's administration. Gomez, the leader\\n\", 'of the revolt, intent upon provoking American interference, laid waste\\n', 'the land with fire and sword. By a proclamation of November 6, 1895, he\\n', 'ordered the destruction of sugar plantations and railway connections and\\n', 'the closure of all sugar factories. The work of ruin was completed by\\n', 'the ruthless Spanish general, Weyler, who concentrated the inhabitants\\n', 'from rural regions into military camps, where they died by the hundreds\\n', 'of disease and starvation. Stories of the atrocities, bad enough in\\n', 'simple form, became lurid when transmuted into American news and deeply\\n', 'moved the sympathies of the American people. Sermons were preached about\\n', 'Spanish misdeeds; orators demanded that the Cubans be sustained \"in\\n', 'their heroic struggle for independence\"; newspapers, scouting the\\n', 'ordinary forms of diplomatic negotiation, spurned mediation and demanded\\n', 'intervention and war if necessary.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"=President Cleveland's Policy.=--Cleveland chose the way of peace. He\\n\", 'ordered the observance of the rule of neutrality. He declined to act on\\n', 'a resolution of Congress in favor of giving to the Cubans the rights of\\n', 'belligerents. Anxious to bring order to the distracted island, he\\n', 'tendered to Spain the good offices of the United States as mediator in\\n', 'the contest--a tender rejected by the Spanish government with the broad\\n', 'hint that President Cleveland might be more vigorous in putting a stop\\n', 'to the unlawful aid in money, arms, and supplies, afforded to the\\n', 'insurgents by American sympathizers. Thereupon the President returned to\\n', 'the course he had marked out for himself, leaving \"the public nuisance\"\\n', 'to his successor, President McKinley.\\n', '\\n', '=Republican Policies.=--The Republicans in 1897 found themselves in a\\n', 'position to employ that \"firm, vigorous, and dignified\" foreign policy\\n', 'which they had approved in their platform. They had declared: \"The\\n', 'government of Spain having lost control of Cuba and being unable to\\n', '\\n', 'protect the property or lives of resident American citizens or to comply\\n', 'with its treaty obligations, we believe that the government of the\\n', 'United States should actively use its influence and good offices to\\n', 'restore peace and give independence to the island.\" The American\\n', 'property in Cuba to which the Republicans referred in their platform\\n', 'amounted by this time to more than fifty million dollars; the commerce\\n', 'with the island reached more than one hundred millions annually; and the\\n', 'claims of American citizens against Spain for property destroyed totaled\\n', 'sixteen millions. To the pleas of humanity which made such an effective\\n', 'appeal to the hearts of the American people, there were thus added\\n', 'practical considerations of great weight.\\n', '\\n', '=President McKinley Negotiates.=--In the face of the swelling tide of\\n', 'popular opinion in favor of quick, drastic, and positive action,\\n', 'inauguration he lodged with the Spanish government a dignified protest\\n', 'against its policies in Cuba, thus opening a game of thrust and parry\\n', 'with the suave ministers at Madrid. The results of the exchange of\\n', 'notes were the recall of the obnoxious General Weyler, the appointment\\n', 'of a governor-general less bloodthirsty in his methods, a change in the\\n', 'policy of concentrating civilians in military camps, and finally a\\n', 'promise of \"home rule\" for Cuba. There is no doubt that the Spanish\\n', 'government was eager to avoid a war that could have but one outcome. The\\n', 'American minister at Madrid, General Woodford, was convinced that firm\\n', 'and patient pressure would have resulted in the final surrender of Cuba\\n', 'by the Spanish government.\\n', '\\n', '=The De Lome and the _Maine_ Incidents.=--Such a policy was defeated by\\n', 'events. In February, 1898, a private letter written by Senor de Lome,\\n', 'the Spanish ambassador at Washington, expressing contempt for the\\n', 'President of the United States, was filched from the mails and passed\\n', 'the world. In the excited state of American opinion, few gave heed to\\n', 'the grave breach of diplomatic courtesy committed by breaking open\\n', 'private correspondence. The Spanish government was compelled to recall\\n', 'De Lome, thus officially condemning his conduct.\\n', '\\n', 'At this point a far more serious crisis put the pacific relations of the\\n', 'two negotiating countries in dire peril. On February 15, the battleship\\n', '_Maine_, riding in the harbor of Havana, was blown up and sunk, carrying\\n', 'to death two officers and two hundred and fifty-eight members of the\\n', 'crew. This tragedy, ascribed by the American public to the malevolence\\n', 'of Spanish officials, profoundly stirred an already furious nation.\\n', 'When, on March 21, a commission of inquiry reported that the ill-fated\\n', 'ship had been blown up by a submarine mine which had in turn set off\\n', \"some of the ship's magazines, the worst suspicions seemed confirmed. If\\n\", 'any one was inclined to be indifferent to the Cuban war for\\n', 'independence, he was now met by the vehement cry: \"Remember the\\n', '_Maine_!\"\\n', '\\n', \"=Spanish Concessions.=--Still the State Department, under McKinley's\\n\", 'steady hand, pursued the path of negotiation, Spain proving more pliable\\n', 'and more ready with promises of reform in the island. Early in April,\\n', 'however, there came a decided change in the tenor of American diplomacy.\\n', 'On the 4th, McKinley, evidently convinced that promises did not mean\\n', 'performances, instructed our minister at Madrid to warn the Spanish\\n', 'government that as no effective armistice had been offered to the\\n', 'Cubans, he would lay the whole matter before Congress. This decision,\\n', 'every one knew, from the temper of Congress, meant war--a prospect which\\n', 'excited all the European powers. The Pope took an active interest in the\\n', 'crisis. France and Germany, foreseeing from long experience in world\\n', 'politics an increase of American power and prestige through war, sought\\n', 'to prevent it. Spain, hopeless and conscious of her weakness, at last\\n', 'dispatched to the President a note promising to suspend hostilities, to\\n', 'call a Cuban parliament, and to grant all the autonomy that could be\\n', 'reasonably asked.\\n', '\\n', '=President McKinley Calls for War.=--For reasons of his own--reasons\\n', 'which have never yet been fully explained--McKinley ignored the final\\n', 'program of concessions presented by Spain. At the very moment when his\\n', 'patient negotiations seemed to bear full fruit, he veered sharply from\\n', 'his course and launched the country into the war by sending to Congress\\n', 'his militant message of April 11, 1898. Without making public the last\\n', 'note he had received from Spain, he declared that he was brought to the\\n', 'end of his effort and the cause was in the hands of Congress. Humanity,\\n', 'the protection of American citizens and property, the injuries to\\n', 'American commerce and business, the inability of Spain to bring about\\n', 'permanent peace in the island--these were the grounds for action that\\n', 'induced him to ask for authority to employ military and naval forces in\\n', 'establishing a stable government in Cuba. They were sufficient for a\\n', 'public already straining at the leash.\\n', '\\n', '=The Resolution of Congress.=--There was no doubt of the outcome when\\n', 'the issue was withdrawn from diplomacy and placed in charge of Congress.\\n', 'Resolutions were soon introduced into the House of Representatives\\n', 'authorizing the President to employ armed force in securing peace and\\n', 'order in the island and \"establishing by the free action of the people\\n', 'thereof a stable and independent government of their own.\" To the form\\n', 'and spirit of this proposal the Democrats and Populists took exception.\\n', 'In the Senate, where they were stronger, their position had to be\\n', 'reckoned with by the narrow Republican majority. As the resolution\\n', 'finally read, the independence of Cuba was recognized; Spain was called\\n', 'upon to relinquish her authority and withdraw from the island; and the\\n', 'President was empowered to use force to the extent necessary to carry\\n', 'the resolutions into effect. Furthermore the United States disclaimed\\n', '\"any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or\\n', 'control over said island except for the pacification thereof.\" Final\\n', 'action was taken by Congress on April 19, 1898, and approved by the\\n', 'President on the following day.\\n', '\\n', '=War and Victory.=--Startling events then followed in swift succession.\\n', 'The navy, as a result in no small measure of the alertness of Theodore\\n', 'Roosevelt, Assistant Secretary of the Department, was ready for the\\n', 'trial by battle. On May 1, Commodore Dewey at Manila Bay shattered the\\n', 'Spanish fleet, marking the doom of Spanish dominion in the Philippines.\\n', 'escape from Havana, was utterly destroyed by American forces under\\n', 'Commodore Schley. On July 17, Santiago, invested by American troops\\n', 'under General Shafter and shelled by the American ships, gave up the\\n', 'struggle. On July 25 General Miles landed in Porto Rico. On August 13,\\n', 'General Merritt and Admiral Dewey carried Manila by storm. The war was\\n', 'over.\\n', '\\n', '=The Peace Protocol.=--Spain had already taken cognizance of stern\\n', 'facts. As early as July 26, 1898, acting through the French ambassador,\\n', 'statement of the terms on which hostilities could be brought to a close.\\n', 'After some skirmishing Spain yielded reluctantly to the ultimatum. On\\n', 'August 12, the preliminary peace protocol was signed, stipulating that\\n', 'Cuba should be free, Porto Rico ceded to the United States, and Manila\\n', 'occupied by American troops pending the formal treaty of peace. On\\n', 'October 1, the commissioners of the two countries met at Paris to bring\\n', 'about the final settlement.\\n', '\\n', '=Peace Negotiations.=--When the day for the first session of the\\n', 'conference arrived, the government at Washington apparently had not made\\n', 'up its mind on the final disposition of the Philippines. Perhaps, before\\n', 'the battle of Manila Bay, not ten thousand people in the United States\\n', 'knew or cared where the Philippines were. Certainly there was in the\\n', 'autumn of 1898 no decided opinion as to what should be done with the\\n', \"fruits of Dewey's victory. President McKinley doubtless voiced the\\n\", 'sentiment of the people when he stated to the peace commissioners on the\\n', 'eve of their departure that there had originally been no thought of\\n', 'conquest in the Pacific.\\n', '\\n', 'The march of events, he added, had imposed new duties on the country.\\n', '\"Incidental to our tenure in the Philippines,\" he said, \"is the\\n', 'commercial opportunity to which American statesmanship cannot be\\n', 'indifferent. It is just to use every legitimate means for the\\n', 'enlargement of American trade.\" On this ground he directed the\\n', 'commissioners to accept not less than the cession of the island of\\n', 'Luzon, the chief of the Philippine group, with its harbor of Manila. It\\n', 'was not until the latter part of October that he definitely instructed\\n', 'them to demand the entire archipelago, on the theory that the occupation\\n', 'of Luzon alone could not be justified \"on political, commercial, or\\n', 'humanitarian grounds.\" This departure from the letter of the peace\\n', 'protocol was bitterly resented by the Spanish agents. It was with\\n', \"heaviness of heart that they surrendered the last sign of Spain's\\n\", 'ancient dominion in the far Pacific.\\n', '\\n', '=The Final Terms of Peace.=--The treaty of peace, as finally agreed\\n', 'upon, embraced the following terms: the independence of Cuba; the\\n', 'cession of Porto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States;\\n', 'the settlement of claims filed by the citizens of both countries; the\\n', 'payment of twenty million dollars to Spain by the United States for the\\n', 'Philippines; and the determination of the status of the inhabitants of\\n', 'the ceded territories by Congress. The great decision had been made. Its\\n', 'issue was in the hands of the Senate where the Democrats and the\\n', 'Populists held the balance of power under the requirement of the\\n', 'two-thirds vote for ratification.\\n', '\\n', '=The Contest in America over the Treaty of Peace.=--The publication of\\n', 'the treaty committing the United States to the administration of distant\\n', 'colonies directed the shifting tides of public opinion into two distinct\\n', 'channels: support of the policy and opposition to it. The trend in\\n', 'Republican leadership, long in the direction marked out by the treaty,\\n', 'now came into the open. Perhaps a majority of the men highest in the\\n', 'councils of that party had undergone the change of heart reflected in\\n', 'the letters of John Hay, Secretary of State. In August of 1898 he had\\n', 'hinted, in a friendly letter to Andrew Carnegie, that he sympathized\\n', 'with the latter\\'s opposition to \"imperialism\"; but he had added quickly:\\n', '\"The only question in my mind is how far it is now possible for us to\\n', 'withdraw from the Philippines.\" In November of the same year he wrote to\\n', 'Whitelaw Reid, one of the peace commissioners at Paris: \"There is a wild\\n', 'and frantic attack now going on in the press against the whole\\n', 'Philippine transaction. Andrew Carnegie really seems to be off his\\n', 'head.... But all this confusion of tongues will go its way. The country\\n', 'will applaud the resolution that has been reached and you will return in\\n', 'the role of conquering heroes with your \\'brows bound with oak.\\'\"\\n', '\\n', 'Senator Beveridge of Indiana and Senator Platt of Connecticut, accepting\\n', 'the verdict of history as the proof of manifest destiny, called for\\n', 'unquestioning support of the administration in its final step. \"Every\\n', 'expansion of our territory,\" said the latter, \"has been in accordance\\n', 'with the irresistible law of growth. We could no more resist the\\n', 'successive expansions by which we have grown to be the strongest nation\\n', 'on earth than a tree can resist its growth. The history of territorial\\n', \"expansion is the history of our nation's progress and glory. It is a\\n\", 'matter to be proud of, not to lament. We should rejoice that Providence\\n', 'has given us the opportunity to extend our influence, our institutions,\\n', 'and our civilization into regions hitherto closed to us, rather than\\n', 'contrive how we can thwart its designs.\"\\n', '\\n', \"This doctrine was savagely attacked by opponents of McKinley's policy,\\n\", 'many a stanch Republican joining with the majority of Democrats in\\n', 'denouncing the treaty as a departure from the ideals of the republic.\\n', 'Senator Vest introduced in the Senate a resolution that \"under the\\n', 'Constitution of the United States, no power is given to the federal\\n', 'Government to acquire territory to be held and governed permanently as\\n', 'colonies.\" Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, whose long and honorable\\n', 'career gave weight to his lightest words, inveighed against the whole\\n', 'procedure and to the end of his days believed that the new drift into\\n', 'rivalry with European nations as a colonial power was fraught with\\n', 'genuine danger. \"Our imperialistic friends,\" he said, \"seem to have\\n', 'forgotten the use of the vocabulary of liberty. They talk about giving\\n', \"good government. 'We shall give them such a government as we think they\\n\", \"are fitted for.' 'We shall give them a better government than they had\\n\", \"before.' Why, Mr. President, that one phrase conveys to a free man and a\\n\", 'free people the most stinging of insults. In that little phrase, as in a\\n', 'seed, is contained the germ of all despotism and of all tyranny.\\n', 'Government is not a gift. Free government is not to be given by all the\\n', 'blended powers of earth and heaven. It is a birthright. It belongs, as\\n', 'our fathers said, and as their children said, as Jefferson said, and as\\n', 'President McKinley said, to human nature itself.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Senate, more conservative on the question of annexation than the\\n', 'House of Representatives composed of men freshly elected in the stirring\\n', 'campaign of 1896, was deliberate about ratification of the treaty. The\\n', 'Democrats and Populists were especially recalcitrant. Mr. Bryan hurried\\n', 'to Washington and brought his personal influence to bear in favor of\\n', 'speedy action. Patriotism required ratification, it was said in one\\n', 'quarter. The country desires peace and the Senate ought not to delay, it\\n', 'was urged in another. Finally, on February 6, 1899, the requisite\\n', 'majority of two-thirds was mustered, many a Senator who voted for the\\n', 'treaty, however, sharing the misgivings of Senator Hoar as to the\\n', '\"dangers of imperialism.\" Indeed at the time, the Senators passed a\\n', 'resolution declaring that the policy to be adopted in the Philippines\\n', 'was still an open question, leaving to the future, in this way, the\\n', 'possibility of retracing their steps.\\n', '\\n', '=The Attitude of England.=--The Spanish war, while accomplishing the\\n', 'simple objects of those who launched the nation on that course, like all\\n', 'other wars, produced results wholly unforeseen. In the first place, it\\n', 'exercised a profound influence on the drift of opinion among European\\n', 'powers. In England, sympathy with the United States was from the first\\n', 'positive and outspoken. \"The state of feeling here,\" wrote Mr. Hay, then\\n', 'the evidences of it come to me. The royal family by habit and tradition\\n', 'are most careful not to break the rules of strict neutrality, but even\\n', 'consistent with propriety--sympathy. Among the political leaders on both\\n', 'other fellows\\' shall not seem more friendly.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Joseph Chamberlain, the distinguished Liberal statesman, thinking no\\n', 'doubt of the continental situation, said in a political address at the\\n', 'very opening of the war that the next duty of Englishmen \"is to\\n', 'establish and maintain bonds of permanent unity with our kinsmen across\\n', 'be, even war would be cheaply purchased if, in a great and noble cause,\\n', 'the Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack should wave together over an\\n', 'Anglo-Saxon alliance.\" To the American ambassador he added\\n', 'significantly that he did not \"care a hang what they say about it on the\\n', 'continent,\" which was another way of expressing the hope that the\\n', 'warning to Germany and France was sufficient. This friendly English\\n', 'opinion, so useful to the United States when a combination of powers to\\n', 'support Spain was more than possible, removed all fears as to the\\n', 'consequences of the war. Henry Adams, recalling days of humiliation in\\n', 'London during the Civil War, when his father was the American\\n', 'ambassador, coolly remarked that it was \"the sudden appearance of\\n', 'Germany as the grizzly terror\" that \"frightened England into America\\'s\\n', 'arms\"; but the net result in keeping the field free for an easy triumph\\n', 'of American arms was none the less appreciated in Washington where,\\n', 'despite outward calm, fears of European complications were never absent.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Filipino Revolt against American Rule.=--In the sphere of domestic\\n', 'politics, as well as in the field of foreign relations, the outcome of\\n', 'the Spanish war exercised a marked influence. It introduced at once\\n', 'problems of colonial administration and difficulties in adjusting trade\\n', 'relations with the outlying dominions. These were furthermore\\n', 'complicated in the very beginning by the outbreak of an insurrection\\n', 'against American sovereignty in the Philippines. The leader of the\\n', 'revolt, Aguinaldo, had been invited to join the American forces in\\n', 'overthrowing Spanish dominion, and he had assumed, apparently without\\n', 'warrant, that independence would be the result of the joint operations.\\n', 'When the news reached him that the American flag had been substituted\\n', 'for the Spanish flag, his resentment was keen. In February, 1899, there\\n', 'occurred a slight collision between his men and some American soldiers.\\n', 'The conflict thus begun was followed by serious fighting which finally\\n', 'dwindled into a vexatious guerrilla warfare lasting three years and\\n', 'costing heavily in men and money. Atrocities were committed by the\\n', 'native insurrectionists and, sad to relate, they were repaid in kind;\\n', 'it was argued in defense of the army that the ordinary rules of warfare\\n', 'were without terror to men accustomed to fighting like savages. In vain\\n', 'did McKinley assure the Filipinos that the institutions and laws\\n', 'established in the islands would be designed \"not for our satisfaction\\n', 'or for the expression of our theoretical views, but for the happiness,\\n', 'peace, and prosperity of the people of the Philippine Islands.\" Nothing\\n', 'short of military pressure could bring the warring revolutionists to\\n', 'terms.\\n', '\\n', '=Attacks on Republican \"Imperialism.\"=--The Filipino insurrection,\\n', 'following so quickly upon the ratification of the treaty with Spain,\\n', \"moved the American opponents of McKinley's colonial policies to redouble\\n\", 'their denunciation of what they were pleased to call \"imperialism.\"\\n', 'Senator Hoar was more than usually caustic in his indictment of the new\\n', 'course. The revolt against American rule did but convince him of the\\n', 'folly hidden in the first fateful measures. Everywhere he saw a\\n', 'speeches, public or private, of the advocates of this war,\" he contended\\n', 'in the Senate, \"or in the press which supports it and them, a single\\n', 'expression anywhere of a desire to do justice to the people of the\\n', 'Philippine Islands, or of a desire to make known to the people of the\\n', 'United States the truth of the case.... The catchwords, the cries, the\\n', 'pithy and pregnant phrases of which their speech is full, all mean\\n', 'dominion. They mean perpetual dominion.... There is not one of these\\n', 'gentlemen who will rise in his place and affirm that if he were a\\n', 'Filipino he would not do exactly as the Filipinos are doing; that he\\n', 'would not despise them if they were to do otherwise. So much at least\\n', 'they owe of respect to the dead and buried history--the dead and buried\\n', 'history so far as they can slay and bury it--of their country.\" In the\\n', 'way of practical suggestions, the Senator offered as a solution of the\\n', 'problem: the recognition of independence, assistance in establishing\\n', 'self-government, and an invitation to all powers to join in a guarantee\\n', 'of freedom to the islands.\\n', '\\n', '=The Republican Answer.=--To McKinley and his supporters, engaged in a\\n', 'sanguinary struggle to maintain American supremacy, such talk was more\\n', 'than quixotic; it was scarcely short of treasonable. They pointed out\\n', 'the practical obstacles in the way of uniform self-government for a\\n', 'collection of seven million people ranging in civilization from the most\\n', 'ignorant hill men to the highly cultivated inhabitants of Manila. The\\n', 'incidents of the revolt and its repression, they admitted, were painful\\n', 'enough; but still nothing as compared with the chaos that would follow\\n', 'the attempt of a people who had never had experience in such matters to\\n', 'set up and sustain democratic institutions. They preferred rather the\\n', 'gradual process of fitting the inhabitants of the islands for\\n', 'self-government. This course, in their eyes, though less poetic, was\\n', 'more in harmony with the ideals of humanity. Having set out upon it,\\n', 'they pursued it steadfastly to the end. First, they applied force\\n', 'without stint to the suppression of the revolt. Then they devoted such\\n', 'genius for colonial administration as they could command to the\\n', 'development of civil government, commerce, and industry.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Boxer Rebellion in China.=--For a nation with a world-wide trade,\\n', 'steadily growing, as the progress of home industries redoubled the zeal\\n', 'for new markets, isolation was obviously impossible. Never was this\\n', 'clearer than in 1900 when a native revolt against foreigners in China,\\n', 'known as the Boxer uprising, compelled the United States to join with\\n', 'the powers of Europe in a military expedition and a diplomatic\\n', 'settlement. The Boxers, a Chinese association, had for some time carried\\n', 'on a campaign of hatred against all aliens in the Celestial empire,\\n', 'calling upon the natives to rise in patriotic wrath and drive out the\\n', 'foreigners who, they said, \"were lacerating China like tigers.\" In the\\n', 'summer of 1900 the revolt flamed up in deeds of cruelty. Missionaries\\n', 'and traders were murdered in the provinces; foreign legations were\\n', 'stoned; the German ambassador, one of the most cordially despised\\n', 'foreigners, was killed in the streets of Peking; and to all appearances\\n', 'a frightful war of extermination had begun. In the month of June nearly\\n', 'five hundred men, women, and children, representing all nations, were\\n', 'besieged in the British quarters in Peking under constant fire of\\n', 'Chinese guns and in peril of a terrible death.\\n', '\\n', '=Intervention in China.=--Nothing but the arrival of armed forces, made\\n', 'up of Japanese, Russian, British, American, French, and German soldiers\\n', 'and marines, prevented the destruction of the beleaguered aliens. When\\n', 'once the foreign troops were in possession of the Chinese capital,\\n', 'diplomatic questions of the most delicate character arose. For more than\\n', 'half a century, the imperial powers of Europe had been carving up the\\n', 'Chinese empire, taking to themselves territory, railway concessions,\\n', 'mining rights, ports, and commercial privileges at the expense of the\\n', 'huge but helpless victim. The United States alone among the great\\n', 'nations, while as zealous as any in the pursuit of peaceful trade, had\\n', 'refrained from seizing Chinese territory or ports. Moreover, the\\n', 'Department of State had been urging European countries to treat China\\n', 'with fairness, to respect her territorial integrity, and to give her\\n', 'equal trading privileges with all nations.\\n', '\\n', '=The American Policy of the \"Open Door.\"=--In the autumn of 1899,\\n', 'Secretary Hay had addressed to London, Berlin, Rome, Paris, Tokyo, and\\n', 'St. Petersburg his famous note on the \"open door\" policy in China. In\\n', 'this document he proposed that existing treaty ports and vested\\n', 'interests of the several foreign countries should be respected; that\\n', 'the Chinese government should be permitted to extend its tariffs to all\\n', 'ports held by alien powers except the few free ports; and that there\\n', 'should be no discrimination in railway and port charges among the\\n', 'citizens of foreign countries operating in the empire. To these\\n', 'principles the governments addressed by Mr. Hay, finally acceded with\\n', 'evident reluctance.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'On this basis he then proposed the settlement that had to follow the\\n', 'Boxer uprising. \"The policy of the Government of the United States,\" he\\n', 'said to the great powers, in the summer of 1900, \"is to seek a solution\\n', 'which may bring about permanent safety and peace to China, preserve\\n', 'Chinese territorial and administrative entity, protect all rights\\n', 'guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international law, and\\n', 'safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with\\n', 'all parts of the Chinese empire.\" This was a friendly warning to the\\n', 'world that the United States would not join in a scramble to punish the\\n', 'Chinese by carving out more territory. \"The moment we acted,\" said Mr.\\n', 'Hay, \"the rest of the world paused and finally came over to our ground;\\n', 'and the German government, which is generally brutal but seldom silly,\\n', 'recovered its senses, and climbed down off its perch.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In taking this position, the Secretary of State did but reflect the\\n', 'common sense of America. \"We are, of course,\" he explained, \"opposed to\\n', 'the dismemberment of that empire and we do not think that the public\\n', 'opinion of the United States would justify this government in taking\\n', 'part in the great game of spoliation now going on.\" Heavy damages were\\n', 'collected by the European powers from China for the injuries inflicted\\n', 'upon their citizens by the Boxers; but the United States, finding the\\n', 'sum awarded in excess of the legitimate claims, returned the balance in\\n', 'the form of a fund to be applied to the education of Chinese students in\\n', 'dupe of China than the chum of the Kaiser.\" By pursuing a liberal\\n', 'policy, he strengthened the hold of the United States upon the\\n', 'affections of the Chinese people and, in the long run, as he remarked\\n', 'himself, safeguarded \"our great commercial interests in that Empire.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Imperialism in the Presidential Campaign of 1900.=--It is not strange\\n', 'that the policy pursued by the Republican administration in disposing of\\n', 'the questions raised by the Spanish War became one of the first issues\\n', 'in the presidential campaign of 1900. Anticipating attacks from every\\n', 'quarter, the Republicans, in renominating McKinley, set forth their\\n', 'position in clear and ringing phrases: \"In accepting by the treaty of\\n', 'Paris the just responsibility of our victories in the Spanish War the\\n', 'President and Senate won the undoubted approval of the American people.\\n', \"No other course was possible than to destroy Spain's sovereignty\\n\", 'throughout the West Indies and in the Philippine Islands. That course\\n', 'created our responsibility, before the world and with the unorganized\\n', 'population whom our intervention had freed from Spain, to provide for\\n', 'the maintenance of law and order, and for the establishment of good\\n', 'government and for the performance of international obligations. Our\\n', 'authority could not be less than our responsibility, and wherever\\n', 'sovereign rights were extended it became the high duty of the government\\n', 'to maintain its authority, to put down armed insurrection, and to confer\\n', 'the blessings of liberty and civilization upon all the rescued peoples.\\n', 'The largest measure of self-government consistent with their welfare and\\n', 'our duties shall be secured to them by law.\" To give more strength to\\n', 'their ticket, the Republican convention, in a whirlwind of enthusiasm,\\n', 'nominated for the vice presidency, against his protest, Theodore\\n', 'Roosevelt, the governor of New York and the hero of the Rough Riders, so\\n', 'popular on account of their Cuban campaign.\\n', '\\n', 'The Democrats, as expected, picked up the gauntlet thrown down with such\\n', 'defiance by the Republicans. Mr. Bryan, whom they selected as their\\n', 'candidate, still clung to the currency issue; but the main emphasis,\\n', 'both of the platform and the appeal for votes, was on the \"imperialistic\\n', 'program\" of the Republican administration. The Democrats denounced the\\n', 'treatment of Cuba and Porto Rico and condemned the Philippine policy in\\n', 'sharp and vigorous terms. \"As we are not willing,\" ran the platform, \"to\\n', 'surrender our civilization or to convert the Republic into an empire, we\\n', \"favor an immediate declaration of the Nation's purpose to give to the\\n\", 'Filipinos, first, a stable form of government; second, independence;\\n', 'third, protection from outside interference.... The greedy commercialism\\n', 'which dictated the Philippine policy of the Republican administration\\n', 'attempts to justify it with the plea that it will pay, but even this\\n', 'sordid and unworthy plea fails when brought to the test of facts. The\\n', \"war of 'criminal aggression' against the Filipinos entailing an annual\\n\", 'expense of many millions has already cost more than any possible profit\\n', 'that could accrue from the entire Philippine trade for years to come....\\n', 'We oppose militarism. It means conquest abroad and intimidation and\\n', 'oppression at home. It means the strong arm which has ever been fatal to\\n', 'free institutions. It is what millions of our citizens have fled from in\\n', 'Europe. It will impose upon our peace-loving people a large standing\\n', 'army, an unnecessary burden of taxation, and would be a constant menace\\n', 'to their liberties.\" Such was the tenor of their appeal to the voters.\\n', '\\n', 'With the issues clearly joined, the country rejected the Democratic\\n', 'candidate even more positively than four years before. The popular vote\\n', 'cast for McKinley was larger and that cast for Bryan smaller than in the\\n', 'silver election. Thus vindicated at the polls, McKinley turned with\\n', 'renewed confidence to the development of the policies he had so far\\n', 'advanced. But fate cut short his designs. In the September following his\\n', 'second inauguration, he was shot by an anarchist while attending the\\n', 'Buffalo exposition. \"What a strange and tragic fate it has been of\\n', 'mine,\" wrote the Secretary of State, John Hay, on the day of the\\n', 'President\\'s death, \"to stand by the bier of three of my dearest friends,\\n', 'Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley, three of the gentlest of men, all risen\\n', 'to the head of the state and all done to death by assassins.\" On\\n', 'September 14, 1901, the Vice President, Theodore Roosevelt, took up the\\n', 'lines of power that had fallen from the hands of his distinguished\\n', 'chief, promising to continue \"absolutely unbroken\" the policies he had\\n', 'inherited.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The economic aspects of the period between 1865 and 1900 may be readily\\n', 'summed up: the recovery of the South from the ruin of the Civil War, the\\n', 'extension of the railways, the development of the Great West, and the\\n', 'triumph of industry and business enterprise. In the South many of the\\n', 'great plantations were broken up and sold in small farms, crops were\\n', 'diversified, the small farming class was raised in the scale of social\\n', 'importance, the cotton industry was launched, and the coal, iron,\\n', 'timber, and other resources were brought into use. In the West the free\\n', 'arable land was practically exhausted by 1890 under the terms of the\\n', 'Homestead Act; gold, silver, copper, coal and other minerals were\\n', 'discovered in abundance; numerous rail connections were formed with the\\n', 'Atlantic seaboard; the cowboy and the Indian were swept away before a\\n', 'standardized civilization of electric lights and bathtubs. By the end of\\n', 'the century the American frontier had disappeared. The wild, primitive\\n', 'life so long associated with America was gone. The unity of the nation\\n', 'was established.\\n', '\\n', 'In the field of business enterprise, progress was most marked. The\\n', 'industrial system, which had risen and flourished before the Civil War,\\n', 'grew into immense proportions and the industrial area was extended from\\n', 'the Northeast into all parts of the country. Small business concerns\\n', 'were transformed into huge corporations. Individual plants were merged\\n', 'under the management of gigantic trusts. Short railway lines were\\n', 'consolidated into national systems. The industrial population of\\n', 'wage-earners rose into the tens of millions. The immigration of aliens\\n', 'increased by leaps and bounds. The cities overshadowed the country. The\\n', 'nation that had once depended upon Europe for most of its manufactured\\n', 'goods became a competitor of Europe in the markets of the earth.\\n', '\\n', 'In the sphere of politics, the period witnessed the recovery of white\\n', 'supremacy in the South; the continued discussion of the old questions,\\n', 'such as the currency, the tariff, and national banking; and the\\n', 'injection of new issues like the trusts and labor problems. As of old,\\n', 'foreign affairs were kept well at the front. Alaska was purchased from\\n', 'Russia; attempts were made to extend American influence in the Caribbean\\n', 'region; a Samoan island was brought under the flag; and the Hawaiian\\n', 'islands were annexed. The Monroe Doctrine was applied with vigor in the\\n', 'dispute between Venezuela and Great Britain.\\n', '\\n', 'Assistance was given to the Cubans in their revolutionary struggle\\n', 'against Spain and thus there was precipitated a war which ended in the\\n', 'annexation of Porto Rico and the Philippines. American influence in the\\n', 'Pacific and the Orient was so enlarged as to be a factor of great weight\\n', 'in world affairs. Thus questions connected with foreign and \"imperial\"\\n', 'policies were united with domestic issues to make up the warp and woof\\n', 'of politics.

Though only forty-three years old he was well versed in the art\\n', 'of practical politics. Coming upon the political scene in the early\\n', 'eighties, he had associated himself with the reformers in the Republican\\n', 'party; but he was no Mugwump. From the first he vehemently preached the\\n', 'doctrine of party loyalty; if beaten in the convention, he voted the\\n', 'straight ticket in the election. For twenty years he adhered to this\\n', 'rule and during a considerable portion of that period he held office as\\n', 'a spokesman of his party. He served in the New York legislature, as head\\n', 'of the metropolitan police force, as federal civil service commissioner\\n', 'under President Harrison, as assistant secretary of the navy under\\n', 'President McKinley, and as governor of the Empire state. Political\\n', 'managers of the old school spoke of him as \"brilliant but erratic\"; they\\n', 'soon found him equal to the shrewdest in negotiation and action.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Panama Canal.=--The most important foreign question confronting\\n', 'President Roosevelt on the day of his inauguration, that of the Panama\\n', 'Canal, was a heritage from his predecessor. The idea of a water route\\n', 'across the isthmus, long a dream of navigators, had become a living\\n', 'issue after the historic voyage of the battleship _Oregon_ around South\\n', 'America during the Spanish War. But before the United States could act\\n', 'it had to undo the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, made with Great Britain in\\n', '1850, providing for the construction of the canal under joint\\n', 'supervision. This was finally effected by the Hay-Pauncefote treaty of\\n', '1901 authorizing the United States to proceed alone, on condition that\\n', 'there should be no discriminations against other nations in the matter\\n', 'of rates and charges.\\n', '\\n', 'This accomplished, it was necessary to decide just where the canal\\n', 'should be built. One group in Congress favored the route through\\n', 'Nicaragua; in fact, two official commissions had already approved that\\n', 'location. Another group favored cutting the way through Panama after\\n', 'purchasing the rights of the old French company which, under the\\n', 'direction of De Lesseps, the hero of the Suez Canal, had made a costly\\n', 'failure some twenty years before. After a heated argument over the\\n', 'merits of the two plans, preference was given to the Panama route. As\\n', 'the isthmus was then a part of Colombia, President Roosevelt proceeded\\n', 'to negotiate with the government at Bogota a treaty authorizing the\\n', 'United States to cut a canal through its territory. The treaty was\\n', 'easily framed, but it was rejected by the Colombian senate, much to the\\n', 'President\\'s exasperation. \"You could no more make an agreement with the\\n', 'Colombian rulers,\" he exclaimed, \"than you could nail jelly to a wall.\"\\n', 'Panama renounced its allegiance to Colombia and three days later the\\n', 'United States recognized its independence.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'This amazing incident was followed shortly by the signature of a treaty\\n', 'between Panama and the United States in which the latter secured the\\n', 'right to construct the long-discussed canal, in return for a guarantee\\n', 'of independence and certain cash payments. The rights and property of\\n', 'lock rather than a sea-level canal was agreed upon. Construction by the\\n', 'government directly instead of by private contractors was adopted.\\n', 'Scientific medicine was summoned to stamp out the tropical diseases\\n', 'that had made Panama a plague spot. Finally, in 1904, as the President\\n', 'said, \"the dirt began to fly.\" After surmounting formidable\\n', 'difficulties--engineering, labor, and sanitary--the American forces in\\n', '1913 joined the waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific. Nearly eight\\n', 'thousand miles were cut off the sea voyage from New York to San\\n', 'Francisco. If any were inclined to criticize President Roosevelt for\\n', 'the way in which he snapped off negotiations with Colombia and\\n', 'recognized the Panama revolutionists, their attention was drawn to the\\n', 'magnificent outcome of the affair. Notwithstanding the treaty with Great\\n', 'Britain, Congress passed a tolls bill discriminating in rates in favor\\n', 'of American ships. It was only on the urgent insistence of President\\n', 'Wilson that the measure was later repealed.\\n', '\\n', '=The Conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War.=--The applause which greeted\\n', \"the President's next diplomatic stroke was unmarred by censure of any\\n\", 'kind. In the winter of 1904 there broke out between Japan and Russia a\\n', 'terrible conflict over the division of spoils in Manchuria. The fortunes\\n', 'of war were with the agile forces of Nippon. In this struggle, it seems,\\n', \"President Roosevelt's sympathies were mainly with the Japanese, although\\n\", 'he observed the proprieties of neutrality. At all events, Secretary Hay\\n', \"wrote in his diary on New Year's Day, 1905, that the President was\\n\", '\"quite firm in his view that we cannot permit Japan to be robbed a\\n', 'second time of her victory,\" referring to the fact that Japan, ten years\\n', 'before, after defeating China on the field of battle, had been forced by\\n', 'Russia, Germany, and France to forego the fruits of conquest.\\n', '\\n', \"Whatever the President's personal feelings may have been, he was aware\\n\", 'that Japan, despite her triumphs over Russia, was staggering under a\\n', 'heavy burden of debt. At a suggestion from Tokyo, he invited both\\n', 'belligerents in the summer of 1905 to join in a peace conference. The\\n', 'celerity of their reply was aided by the pressure of European bankers,\\n', 'who had already come to a substantial agreement that the war must stop.\\n', 'After some delay, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, was chosen as the meeting\\n', 'place for the spokesmen of the two warring powers. Roosevelt presided\\n', 'over the opening ceremonies with fine urbanity, thoroughly enjoying the\\n', \"justly earned honor of being for the moment at the center of the world's\\n\", 'interest. He had the satisfaction of seeing the conference end in a\\n', 'treaty of peace and amity.\\n', '\\n', '=The Monroe Doctrine Applied to Germany.=--Less spectacular than the\\n', 'Russo-Japanese settlement but not less important was a diplomatic\\n', 'passage-at-arms with Germany over the Monroe Doctrine. This clash grew\\n', 'out of the inability or unwillingness of the Venezuelan government to\\n', 'pay debts due foreign creditors. Having exhausted their patience in\\n', 'negotiations, England and Germany, in December 1901, sent battleships to\\n', 'establish what they characterized as \"a peaceful blockade\" of Venezuelan\\n', 'ports. Their action was followed by the rupture of diplomatic relations;\\n', 'there was a possibility that war and the occupation of Venezuelan\\n', 'territory might result.\\n', '\\n', 'While unwilling to stand between a Latin-American country and its\\n', 'creditors, President Roosevelt was determined that debt collecting\\n', 'should not be made an excuse for European countries to seize territory.\\n', 'He therefore urged arbitration of the dispute, winning the assent of\\n', 'England and Italy. Germany, with a somewhat haughty air, refused to take\\n', 'the milder course. The President, learning of this refusal, called the\\n', 'German ambassador to the White House and informed him in very precise\\n', 'terms that, unless the Imperial German Government consented to\\n', 'arbitrate, Admiral Dewey would be ordered to the scene with instructions\\n', 'and no answer came from Berlin. Not baffled, the President again took\\n', 'the matter up with the ambassador, this time with even more firmness; he\\n', 'stated in language admitting of but one meaning that, unless within\\n', 'forty-eight hours the Emperor consented to arbitration, American\\n', 'battleships, already coaled and cleared, would sail for Venezuelan\\n', 'waters. The hint was sufficient. The Kaiser accepted the proposal and\\n', 'the President, with the fine irony of diplomacy, complimented him\\n', 'publicly on \"being so stanch an advocate of arbitration.\" In terms of\\n', 'the Monroe Doctrine this action meant that the United States, while not\\n', 'denying the obligations of debtors, would not permit any move on the\\n', 'part of European powers that might easily lead to the temporary or\\n', 'permanent occupation of Latin-American territory.\\n', '\\n', '=The Santo Domingo Affair.=--The same issue was involved in a\\n', 'controversy over Santo Domingo which arose in 1904. The Dominican\\n', 'republic, like Venezuela, was heavily in debt, and certain European\\n', 'countries declared that, unless the United States undertook to look\\n', 'after the finances of the embarrassed debtor, they would resort to armed\\n', 'coercion. What was the United States to do? The danger of having some\\n', 'European power strongly intrenched in Santo Domingo was too imminent to\\n', 'be denied. President Roosevelt acted with characteristic speed, and\\n', 'notwithstanding strong opposition in the Senate was able, in 1907, to\\n', 'effect a treaty arrangement which placed Dominican finances under\\n', 'American supervision.\\n', '\\n', 'In the course of the debate over this settlement, a number of\\n', 'interesting questions arose. It was pertinently asked whether the\\n', 'American navy should be used to help creditors collect their debts\\n', 'anywhere in Latin-America. It was suggested also that no sanction should\\n', 'be given to the practice among European governments of using armed force\\n', \"to collect private claims. Opponents of President Roosevelt's policy,\\n\", 'and they were neither few nor insignificant, urged that such matters\\n', 'should be referred to the Hague Court or to special international\\n', 'commissions for arbitration. To this the answer was made that the United\\n', 'States could not surrender any question coming under the terms of the\\n', 'Monroe Doctrine to the decision of an international tribunal. The\\n', 'position of the administration was very clearly stated by President\\n', 'Roosevelt himself. \"The country,\" he said, \"would certainly decline to\\n', 'go to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a just debt;\\n', 'on the other hand, it is very inadvisable to permit any foreign power to\\n', 'take possession, even temporarily, of the customs houses of an American\\n', 'republic in order to enforce the payment of its obligations; for such a\\n', 'temporary occupation might turn into a permanent occupation. The only\\n', 'escape from these alternatives may at any time be that we must\\n', 'ourselves undertake to bring about some arrangement by which so much as\\n', 'possible of a just obligation shall be paid.\" The Monroe Doctrine was\\n', 'negative. It denied to European powers a certain liberty of operation in\\n', 'this hemisphere. The positive obligations resulting from its application\\n', 'by the United States were points now emphasized and developed.\\n', '\\n', '=The Hague Conference.=--The controversies over Latin-American relations\\n', 'and his part in bringing the Russo-Japanese War to a close naturally\\n', 'made a deep impression upon Roosevelt, turning his mind in the direction\\n', 'of the peaceful settlement of international disputes. The subject was\\n', 'moreover in the air. As if conscious of impending calamity, the\\n', 'statesmen of the Old World, to all outward signs at least, seemed\\n', 'searching for a way to reduce armaments and avoid the bloody and costly\\n', 'trial of international causes by the ancient process of battle. It was\\n', 'which he helped to bring upon mankind, who summoned the delegates of the\\n', 'nations in the first Hague Peace Conference in 1899. The conference did\\n', 'nothing to reduce military burdens or avoid wars but it did recognize\\n', 'the right of friendly nations to offer the services of mediation to\\n', 'countries at war and did establish a Court at the Hague for the\\n', 'arbitration of international disputes.\\n', '\\n', 'Encouraged by this experiment, feeble as it was, President Roosevelt in\\n', '1904 proposed a second conference, yielding to the Czar the honor of\\n', 'issuing the call. At this great international assembly, held at the\\n', 'Hague in 1907, the representatives of the United States proposed a plan\\n', 'for the compulsory arbitration of certain matters of international\\n', 'dispute. This was rejected with contempt by Germany. Reduction of\\n', 'armaments, likewise proposed in the conference, was again deferred. In\\n', 'fact, nothing was accomplished beyond agreement upon certain rules for\\n', 'the conduct of \"civilized warfare,\" casting a somewhat lurid light upon\\n', 'the \"pacific\" intentions of most of the powers assembled.\\n', '\\n', '=The World Tour of the Fleet.=--As if to assure the world then that the\\n', 'United States placed little reliance upon the frail reed of peace\\n', 'conferences, Roosevelt the following year (1908) made an imposing\\n', 'display of American naval power by sending a fleet of sixteen\\n', 'battleships on a tour around the globe. On his own authority, he ordered\\n', 'the ships to sail out of Hampton Roads and circle the earth by way of\\n', 'the Straits of Magellan, San Francisco, Australia, the Philippines,\\n', 'China, Japan, and the Suez Canal. This enterprise was not, as some\\n', 'critics claimed, a \"mere boyish flourish.\" President Roosevelt knew how\\n', 'deep was the influence of sea power on the fate of nations. He was aware\\n', 'that no country could have a wide empire of trade and dominion without\\n', 'force adequate to sustain it. The voyage around the world therefore\\n', 'served a double purpose. It interested his own country in the naval\\n', 'program of the government, and it reminded other powers that the\\n', 'American giant, though quiet, was not sleeping in the midst of\\n', 'international rivalries.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'foreign policy, President Roosevelt advanced with firm step in a path\\n', 'already marked out. President McKinley had defined the principles that\\n', 'were to control the development of Porto Rico and the Philippines. The\\n', 'Republican party had announced a program of pacification, gradual\\n', 'self-government, and commercial improvement. The only remaining question\\n', 'of importance, to use the popular phrase,--\"Does the Constitution follow\\n', 'the flag?\"--had been answered by the Supreme Court of the United States.\\n', 'Although it was well known that the Constitution did not contemplate the\\n', 'government of dependencies, such as the Philippines and Porto Rico, the\\n', 'Court, by generous and ingenious interpretations, found a way for\\n', 'Congress to apply any reasonable rules required by the occasion.\\n', '\\n', '=Porto Rico.=--The government of Porto Rico was a relatively simple\\n', 'matter. It was a single island with a fairly homogeneous population\\n', 'apart from the Spanish upper class. For a time after military occupation\\n', 'in 1898, it was administered under military rule. This was succeeded by\\n', 'the establishment of civil government under the \"organic act\" passed by\\n', 'Congress in 1900. The law assured to the Porto Ricans American\\n', 'protection but withheld American citizenship--a boon finally granted in\\n', '1917. It provided for a governor and six executive secretaries appointed\\n', 'by the President with the approval of the Senate; and for a legislature\\n', 'of two houses--one elected by popular native vote, and an upper chamber\\n', 'composed of the executive secretaries and five other persons appointed\\n', 'in the same manner. Thus the United States turned back to the provincial\\n', 'system maintained by England in Virginia or New York in old colonial\\n', 'days. The natives were given a voice in their government and the power\\n', 'of initiating laws; but the final word both in law-making and\\n', 'administration was vested in officers appointed in Washington. Such was\\n', 'the plan under which the affairs of Porto Rico were conducted by\\n', 'President Roosevelt. It lasted until the new organic act of 1917.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Philippines.=--The administration of the Philippines presented far\\n', 'more difficult questions. The number of islands, the variety of\\n', 'languages and races, the differences in civilization all combined to\\n', 'challenge the skill of the government. Moreover, there was raging in\\n', '1901 a stubborn revolt against American authority, which had to be\\n', 'faced. Following the lines laid down by President McKinley, the\\n', 'evolution of American policy fell into three stages. At first the\\n', 'islands were governed directly by the President under his supreme\\n', 'military power. In 1901 a civilian commission, headed by William Howard\\n', 'Taft, was selected by the President and charged with the government of\\n', 'the provinces in which order had been restored. Six years later, under\\n', 'the terms of an organic act, passed by Congress in 1902, the third stage\\n', 'was reached. The local government passed into the hands of a governor\\n', 'and commission, appointed by the President and Senate, and a\\n', 'legislature--one house elected by popular vote and an upper chamber\\n', '\\n', 'composed of the commission. This scheme, like that obtaining in Porto\\n', 'Rico, remained intact until a Democratic Congress under President\\n', \"Wilson's leadership carried the colonial administration into its fourth\\n\", 'phase by making both houses elective. Thus, by the steady pursuit of a\\n', 'liberal policy, self-government was extended to the dependencies; but it\\n', 'encouraged rather than extinguished the vigorous movement among the\\n', 'Philippine natives for independence.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Cuban Relations.=--Within the sphere of colonial affairs, Cuba, though\\n', 'nominally independent, also presented problems to the government at\\n', 'Washington. In the fine enthusiasm that accompanied the declaration of\\n', 'war on Spain, Congress, unmindful of practical considerations,\\n', 'recognized the independence of Cuba and disclaimed \"any disposition or\\n', 'intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said\\n', 'island except for the pacification thereof.\" In the settlement that\\n', 'followed the war, however, it was deemed undesirable to set the young\\n', 'republic adrift upon the stormy sea of international politics without a\\n', 'guiding hand. Before withdrawing American troops from the island,\\n', 'Congress, in March, 1901, enacted, and required Cuba to approve, a\\n', 'series of restrictions known as the Platt amendment, limiting her power\\n', 'to incur indebtedness, securing the right of the United States to\\n', 'intervene whenever necessary to protect life and property, and reserving\\n', 'to the United States coaling stations at certain points to be agreed\\n', 'upon. The Cubans made strong protests against what they deemed\\n', '\"infringements of their sovereignty\"; but finally with good grace\\n', 'accepted their fate. Even when in 1906 President Roosevelt landed\\n', 'American troops in the island to quell a domestic dissension, they\\n', 'acquiesced in the action, evidently regarding it as a distinct warning\\n', 'that they should learn to manage their elections in an orderly manner.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Social Questions to the Front.=--From the day of his inauguration to\\n', 'the close of his service in 1909, President Roosevelt, in messages,\\n', 'speeches, and interviews, kept up a lively and interesting discussion of\\n', 'trusts, capital, labor, poverty, riches, lawbreaking, good citizenship,\\n', 'and kindred themes. Many a subject previously touched upon only by\\n', 'representatives of the minor and dissenting parties, he dignified by a\\n', 'careful examination. That he did this with any fixed design or policy in\\n', 'mind does not seem to be the case. He admitted himself that when he\\n', 'became President he did not have in hand any settled or far-reaching\\n', 'plan of social betterment. He did have, however, serious convictions on\\n', '\"the most efficient possible instrument in helping the people of the\\n', 'United States to better themselves in every way, politically, socially,\\n', 'had departed a long way from the old idea of the government as nothing\\n', 'but a great policeman keeping order among the people in a struggle over\\n', \"the distribution of the nation's wealth and resources.\\n\", '\\n', \"=Roosevelt's View of the Constitution.=--Equally significant was\\n\", \"Roosevelt's attitude toward the Constitution and the office of\\n\", 'President. He utterly repudiated the narrow construction of our national\\n', 'charter. He held that the Constitution \"should be treated as the\\n', 'greatest document ever devised by the wit of man to aid a people in\\n', 'exercising every power necessary for its own betterment, not as a\\n', 'strait-jacket cunningly fashioned to strangle growth.\" He viewed the\\n', 'presidency as he did the Constitution. Strict constructionists of the\\n', 'Jeffersonian school, of whom there were many on occasion even in the\\n', 'Republican party, had taken a view that the President could do nothing\\n', 'that he was not specifically authorized by the Constitution to do.\\n', 'Roosevelt took exactly the opposite position. It was his opinion that it\\n', 'was not only the President\\'s right but his duty \"to do anything that the\\n', 'needs of the nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the\\n', 'Constitution or the laws.\" He went on to say that he acted \"for the\\n', 'common well-being of all our people whenever and in whatever manner was\\n', 'necessary, unless prevented by direct constitutional or legislative\\n', 'prohibition.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Trusts and Railways.=--To the trust question, Roosevelt devoted\\n', 'especial attention. This was unavoidable. By far the larger part of the\\n', 'business of the country was done by corporations as distinguished from\\n', 'partnerships and individual owners. The growth of these gigantic\\n', 'aggregations of capital had been the leading feature in American\\n', 'industrial development during the last two decades of the nineteenth\\n', 'century. In the conquest of business by trusts and \"the resulting\\n', 'private fortunes of great magnitude,\" the Populists and the Democrats\\n', 'had seen a grievous danger to the republic. \"Plutocracy has taken the\\n', 'place of democracy; the tariff breeds trusts; let us destroy therefore\\n', 'the tariff and the trusts\"--such was the battle cry which had been taken\\n', 'up by Bryan and his followers.\\n', '\\n', 'President Roosevelt countered vigorously. He rejected the idea that the\\n', 'trusts were the product of the tariff or of governmental action of any\\n', 'kind. He insisted that they were the outcome of \"natural economic\\n', 'forces\": (1) destructive competition among business men compelling them\\n', 'to avoid ruin by cooperation in fixing prices; (2) the growth of markets\\n', 'on a national scale and even international scale calling for vast\\n', 'of immense savings by the union of many plants under one management. In\\n', 'the corporation he saw a new stage in the development of American\\n', 'industry. Unregulated competition he regarded as \"the source of evils\\n', 'which all men concede must be remedied if this civilization of ours is\\n', 'to survive.\" The notion, therefore, that these immense business concerns\\n', 'should be or could be broken up by a decree of law, Roosevelt considered\\n', 'absurd.\\n', '\\n', 'At the same time he proposed that \"evil trusts\" should be prevented from\\n', '\"wrong-doing of any kind\"; that is, punished for plain swindling, for\\n', 'making agreements to limit output, for refusing to sell to customers who\\n', 'dealt with rival firms, and for conspiracies with railways to ruin\\n', 'competitors by charging high freight rates and for similar abuses.\\n', 'Accordingly, he proposed, not the destruction of the trusts, but their\\n', 'regulation by the government. This, he contended, would preserve the\\n', 'advantages of business on a national scale while preventing the evils\\n', 'that accompanied it. The railway company he declared to be a public\\n', 'servant. \"Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike.\"\\n', 'So he answered those who thought that trusts and railway combinations\\n', 'were private concerns to be managed solely by their owners without let\\n', 'or hindrance and also those who thought trusts and railway combinations\\n', 'could be abolished by tariff reduction or criminal prosecution.\\n', '\\n', '=The Labor Question.=--On the labor question, then pressing to the front\\n', 'in public interest, President Roosevelt took advanced ground for his\\n', 'time. He declared that the working-man, single-handed and empty-handed,\\n', 'threatened with starvation if unemployed, was no match for the employer\\n', 'who was able to bargain and wait. This led him, accordingly, to accept\\n', 'the principle of the trade union; namely, that only by collective\\n', 'bargaining can labor be put on a footing to measure its strength equally\\n', 'with capital. While he severely arraigned labor leaders who advocated\\n', 'violence and destructive doctrines, he held that \"the organization of\\n', 'labor into trade unions and federations is necessary, is beneficent, and\\n', 'is one of the greatest possible agencies in the attainment of a true\\n', 'industrial, as well as a true political, democracy in the United\\n', 'States.\" The last resort of trade unions in labor disputes, the strike,\\n', 'he approved in case negotiations failed to secure \"a fair deal.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He thought, however, that labor organizations, even if wisely managed,\\n', 'could not solve all the pressing social questions of the time. The aid\\n', 'of the government at many points he believed to be necessary to\\n', 'eliminate undeserved poverty, industrial diseases, unemployment, and the\\n', 'unfortunate consequences of industrial accidents. In his first message\\n', 'of 1901, for instance, he urged that workers injured in industry should\\n', 'have certain and ample compensation. From time to time he advocated\\n', 'other legislation to obtain what he called \"a larger measure of social\\n', 'and industrial justice.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Great Riches and Taxation.=--Even the challenge of the radicals, such\\n', 'as the Populists, who alleged that \"the toil of millions is boldly\\n', 'stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few\"--challenges which his\\n', 'predecessors did not consider worthy of notice--President Roosevelt\\n', 'refused to let pass without an answer. In his first message he denied\\n', 'the truth of the common saying that the rich were growing richer and the\\n', 'poor were growing poorer. He asserted that, on the contrary, the average\\n', 'man, wage worker, farmer, and small business man, was better off than\\n', 'ever before in the history of our country. That there had been abuses in\\n', 'the accumulation of wealth he did not pretend to ignore, but he believed\\n', 'that even immense fortunes, on the whole, represented positive benefits\\n', 'conferred upon the country. Nevertheless he felt that grave dangers to\\n', 'the safety and the happiness of the people lurked in great inequalities\\n', 'of wealth. In 1906 he wrote that he wished it were in his power to\\n', 'prevent the heaping up of enormous fortunes. The next year, to the\\n', 'astonishment of many leaders in his own party, he boldly announced in a\\n', 'message to Congress that he approved both income and inheritance taxes,\\n', 'then generally viewed as Populist or Democratic measures. He even took\\n', 'the stand that such taxes should be laid in order to bring about a more\\n', 'equitable distribution of wealth and greater equality of opportunity\\n', 'among citizens.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Economic Legislation.=--When President Roosevelt turned from the field\\n', 'of opinion he found himself in a different sphere. Many of his views\\n', 'were too advanced for the members of his party in Congress, and where\\n', 'results depended upon the making of new laws, his progress was slow.\\n', 'Nevertheless, in his administrations several measures were enacted that\\n', 'bore the stamp of his theories, though it could hardly be said that he\\n', 'dominated Congress to the same degree as did some other Presidents. The\\n', 'Hepburn Railway Act of 1906 enlarged the interstate commerce commission;\\n', \"it extended the commission's power over oil pipe lines, express\\n\", 'companies, and other interstate carriers; it gave the commission the\\n', 'right to reduce rates found to be unreasonable and discriminatory; it\\n', 'forbade \"midnight tariffs,\" that is, sudden changes in rates favoring\\n', 'certain shippers; and it prohibited common carriers from transporting\\n', 'goods owned by themselves, especially coal, except for their own proper\\n', 'use. Two important pure food and drug laws, enacted during the same\\n', 'year, were designed to protect the public against diseased meats and\\n', 'was an act of the same Congress making interstate railways liable to\\n', 'damages for injuries sustained by their employees. When this measure was\\n', 'declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court it was reenacted with the\\n', 'was offered in the law of 1908 limiting the hours of railway employees\\n', 'engaged as trainmen or telegraph operators.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Reclamation and Conservation.=--The open country--the deserts, the\\n', 'forests, waterways, and the public lands--interested President Roosevelt\\n', 'no less than railway and industrial questions. Indeed, in his first\\n', 'message to Congress he placed the conservation of natural resources\\n', 'among \"the most vital internal problems\" of the age, and forcibly\\n', 'emphasized an issue that had been discussed in a casual way since\\n', \"Cleveland's first administration. The suggestion evoked an immediate\\n\", 'response in Congress. Under the leadership of Senator Newlands, of\\n', 'Nevada, the Reclamation Act of 1902 was passed, providing for the\\n', 'redemption of the desert areas of the West. The proceeds from the sale\\n', 'of public lands were dedicated to the construction of storage dams and\\n', 'sluiceways to hold water and divert it as needed to the thirsty sands.\\n', 'Furthermore it was stipulated that the rents paid by water users should\\n', 'go into a reclamation fund to continue the good work forever.\\n', 'Construction was started immediately under the terms of the law. Within\\n', 'seventeen years about 1,600,000 acres had been reclaimed and more than a\\n', 'million were actually irrigated. In the single year 1918, the crops of\\n', 'the irrigated districts were valued at approximately $100,000,000.\\n', '\\n', 'In his first message, also, President Roosevelt urged the transfer of\\n', 'all control over national forests to trained men in the Bureau of\\n', 'Forestry--a recommendation carried out in 1907 when the Forestry Service\\n', 'was created. In every direction noteworthy advances were made in the\\n', 'administration of the national domain. The science of forestry was\\n', 'improved and knowledge of the subject spread among the people. Lands in\\n', 'the national forest available for agriculture were opened to settlers.\\n', 'Water power sites on the public domain were leased for a term of years\\n', 'to private companies instead of being sold outright. The area of the\\n', 'national forests was enlarged from 43 million acres to 194 million acres\\n', 'by presidential proclamation--more than 43 million acres being added in\\n', 'one year, 1907. The men who turned sheep and cattle to graze on the\\n', 'public lands were compelled to pay a fair rental, much to their\\n', 'dissatisfaction. Fire prevention work was undertaken in the forests on a\\n', 'large scale, reducing the appalling, annual destruction of timber.\\n', 'Millions of acres of coal land, such as the government had been\\n', 'carelessly selling to mining companies at low figures, were withdrawn\\n', 'from sale and held until Congress was prepared to enact laws for the\\n', 'disposition of them in the public interest. Prosecutions were\\n', 'instituted against men who had obtained public lands by fraud and vast\\n', 'tracts were recovered for the national domain. An agitation was begun\\n', 'which bore fruit under the administrations of Taft and Wilson in laws\\n', 'reserving to the federal government the ownership of coal, water power,\\n', 'phosphates, and other natural resources while authorizing corporations\\n', 'to develop them under leases for a period of years.\\n', '\\n', '=The Prosecution of the Trusts.=--As an executive, President Roosevelt\\n', 'was also a distinct \"personality.\" His discrimination between \"good\" and\\n', '\"bad\" trusts led him to prosecute some of them with vigor. On his\\n', 'initiative, the Northern Securities Company, formed to obtain control of\\n', 'certain great western railways, was dissolved by order of the Supreme\\n', 'Court. Proceedings were instituted against the American Tobacco Company\\n', 'and the Standard Oil Company as monopolies in violation of the Sherman\\n', 'Anti-Trust law. The Sugar Trust was found guilty of cheating the New\\n', 'York customs house and some of the minor officers were sent to prison.\\n', 'Frauds in the Post-office Department were uncovered and the offenders\\n', 'brought to book. In fact hardly a week passed without stirring news of\\n', '\"wrong doers\" and \"malefactors\" haled into federal courts.\\n', '\\n', '=The Great Coal Strike.=--The Roosevelt theory that the President could\\n', 'do anything for public welfare not forbidden by the Constitution and the\\n', 'miners, which started in the summer, ran late into the autumn.\\n', 'Industries were paralyzed for the want of coal; cities were threatened\\n', 'with the appalling menace of a winter without heat. Governors and mayors\\n', 'were powerless and appealed for aid. The mine owners rejected the\\n', 'demands of the men and refused to permit the arbitration of the points\\n', 'in dispute, although John Mitchell, the leader of the miners, repeatedly\\n', 'urged it. After observing closely the course affairs, President\\n', 'Roosevelt made up his mind that the situation was intolerable. He\\n', 'arranged to have the federal troops, if necessary, take possession of\\n', 'the mines and operate them until the strike could be settled. He then\\n', 'invited the contestants to the White House and by dint of hard labor\\n', 'induced them to accept, as a substitute or compromise, arbitration by a\\n', 'commission which he appointed. Thus, by stepping outside the\\n', 'Constitution and acting as the first citizen of the land, President\\n', 'Roosevelt averted a crisis of great magnitude.\\n', '\\n', '=The Election of 1904.=--The views and measures which he advocated with\\n', 'such vigor aroused deep hostility within as well as without his party.\\n', 'There were rumors of a Republican movement to defeat his nomination in\\n', '1904 and it was said that the \"financial and corporation interests\" were\\n', 'accused him of having \"stolen Mr. Bryan\\'s thunder,\" by harrying the\\n', 'trusts and favoring labor unions. When the Republican convention\\n', 'assembled in Chicago, however, the opposition disappeared and Roosevelt\\n', 'was nominated by acclamation.\\n', '\\n', 'This was the signal for a change on the part of Democratic leaders. They\\n', 'denounced the President as erratic, dangerous, and radical and decided\\n', 'to assume the moderate role themselves. They put aside Mr. Bryan and\\n', '\\n', 'who repudiated free silver and made a direct appeal for the conservative\\n', \"vote. The outcome of the reversal was astounding. Judge Parker's vote\\n\", 'fell more than a million below that cast for Bryan in 1900; of the 476\\n', 'electoral votes he received only 140. Roosevelt, in addition to sweeping\\n', 'the Republican sections, even invaded Democratic territory, carrying the\\n', 'state of Missouri. Thus vindicated at the polls, he became more\\n', 'outspoken than ever. His leadership in the party was so widely\\n', 'recognized that he virtually selected his own successor.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Campaign of 1908.=--Long before the end of his elective term,\\n', 'President Roosevelt let it be known that he favored as his successor,\\n', 'William Howard Taft, of Ohio, his Secretary of War. To attain this end\\n', 'he used every shred of his powerful influence. When the Republican\\n', 'convention assembled, Mr. Taft easily won the nomination. Though the\\n', 'party platform was conservative in tone, he gave it a progressive tinge\\n', 'by expressing his personal belief in the popular election of United\\n', 'States Senators, an income tax, and other liberal measures. President\\n', 'Roosevelt announced his faith in the Republican candidate and appealed\\n', 'to the country for his election.\\n', '\\n', 'The turn in Republican affairs now convinced Mr. Bryan that the signs\\n', 'were propitious for a third attempt to win the presidency. The disaster\\n', 'to Judge Parker had taught the party that victory did not lie in a\\n', 'conservative policy. With little difficulty, therefore, the veteran\\n', 'leader from Nebraska once more rallied the Democrats around his\\n', 'standard, won the nomination, and wrote a platform vigorously attacking\\n', 'the tariff, trusts, and monopolies. Supported by a loyal following, he\\n', 'entered the lists, only to meet another defeat. Though he polled almost\\n', 'a million and a half more votes than did Judge Parker in 1904, the palm\\n', 'went to Mr. Taft.\\n', '\\n', '=The Tariff Revision and Party Dissensions.=--At the very beginning of\\n', 'his term, President Taft had to face the tariff issue. He had met it in\\n', 'the campaign. Moved by the Democratic demand for a drastic reduction, he\\n', 'had expressed opinions which were thought to imply a \"downward\\n', 'revision.\" The Democrats made much of the implication and the\\n', 'Republicans from the Middle West rejoiced in it. Pressure was coming\\n', 'from all sides. More than ten years had elapsed since the enactment of\\n', 'the Dingley bill and the position of many industries had been altered\\n', 'with the course of time. Evidently the day for revision--at best a\\n', 'thankless task--had arrived. Taft accepted the inevitable and called\\n', 'Congress in a special session. Until the midsummer of 1909, Republican\\n', 'Senators and Representatives wrangled over tariff schedules, the\\n', 'President making little effort to influence their decisions. When on\\n', 'August 5 the Payne-Aldrich bill became a law, a breach had been made in\\n', 'Republican ranks. Powerful Senators from the Middle West had spoken\\n', 'angrily against many of the high rates imposed by the bill. They had\\n', 'even broken with their party colleagues to vote against the entire\\n', 'scheme of tariff revision.\\n', '\\n', '=The Income Tax Amendment.=--The rift in party harmony was widened by\\n', 'another serious difference of opinion. During the debate on the tariff\\n', 'bill, there was a concerted movement to include in it an income tax\\n', 'provision--this in spite of the decision of the Supreme Court in 1895\\n', 'declaring it unconstitutional. Conservative men were alarmed by the\\n', 'evident willingness of some members to flout a solemn decree of that\\n', 'eminent tribunal. At the same time they saw a powerful combination of\\n', 'Republicans and Democrats determined upon shifting some of the burden of\\n', 'taxation to large incomes. In the press of circumstances, a compromise\\n', 'was reached. The income tax bill was dropped for the present; but\\n', 'Congress passed the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution, authorizing\\n', 'taxes upon incomes from whatever source they might be derived, without\\n', 'reference to any apportionment among the states on the basis of\\n', 'population. The states ratified the amendment and early in 1913 it was\\n', 'proclaimed.\\n', '\\n', \"=President Taft's Policies.=--After the enactment of the tariff bill,\\n\", 'Taft continued to push forward with his legislative program. He\\n', 'recommended, and Congress created, a special court of commerce with\\n', 'jurisdiction, among other things, over appeals from the interstate\\n', 'commerce commission, thus facilitating judicial review of the railway\\n', 'rates fixed and the orders issued by that body. This measure was quickly\\n', 'followed by an act establishing a system of postal savings banks in\\n', 'connection with the post office--a scheme which had long been opposed by\\n', 'private banks. Two years later, Congress defied the lobby of the express\\n', 'companies and supplemented the savings banks with a parcels post system,\\n', 'thus enabling the American postal service to catch up with that of other\\n', 'progressive nations. With a view to improving the business\\n', 'administration of the federal government, the President obtained from\\n', 'Congress a large appropriation for an economy and efficiency commission\\n', 'charged with the duty of inquiring into wasteful and obsolete methods\\n', 'and recommending improved devices and practices. The chief result of\\n', 'this investigation was a vigorous report in favor of a national budget\\n', 'system, which soon found public backing.\\n', '\\n', 'President Taft negotiated with England and France general treaties\\n', 'providing for the arbitration of disputes which were \"justiciable\" in\\n', 'character even though they might involve questions of \"vital interest\\n', 'and national honor.\" They were coldly received in the Senate and so\\n', 'agreement with Canada, however, he forced through Congress in the face\\n', 'of strong opposition from his own party. After making a serious breach\\n', 'in Republican ranks, he was chagrined to see the whole scheme come to\\n', 'naught by the overthrow of the Liberals in the Canadian elections of\\n', '1911.\\n', '\\n', '=Prosecution of the Trusts.=--The party schism was even enlarged by what\\n', 'appeared to be the successful prosecution of several great combinations.\\n', 'In two important cases, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of the\\n', 'Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company on the ground that\\n', 'they violated the Sherman Anti-Trust law. In taking this step Chief\\n', 'Justice White was at some pains to state that the law did not apply to\\n', 'combinations which did not \"unduly\" restrain trade. His remark,\\n', 'construed to mean that the Court would not interfere with corporations\\n', 'as such, became the subject of a popular outcry against the President\\n', 'and the judges.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"=Growing Dissensions.=--All in all, Taft's administration from the first\\n\", 'day had been disturbed by party discord. High words had passed over the\\n', 'tariff bill and disgruntled members of Congress could not forget them.\\n', 'To differences over issues were added quarrels between youth and old\\n', 'age. In the House of Representatives there developed a group of young\\n', '\"insurgent\" Republicans who resented the dominance of the Speaker,\\n', 'the men of long service and conservative minds. In 1910, the insurgents\\n', 'went so far as to join with the Democrats in a movement to break the\\n', \"Speaker's sway by ousting him from the rules committee and depriving him\\n\", 'of the power to appoint its members. The storm was brewing. In the\\n', 'autumn of that year the Democrats won a clear majority in the House of\\n', 'Representatives and began an open battle with President Taft by\\n', 'demanding an immediate downward revision of the tariff.\\n', '\\n', '=The Rise of the Progressive Republicans.=--Preparatory to the campaign\\n', 'of 1912, the dissenters within the Republican party added the prefix\\n', '\"Progressive\" to their old title and began to organize a movement to\\n', 'prevent the renomination of Mr. Taft. As early as January 21, 1911, they\\n', 'formed a Progressive Republican League at the home of Senator La\\n', 'Follette of Wisconsin and launched an attack on the Taft measures and\\n', 'policies. In October they indorsed Mr. La Follette as \"the logical\\n', 'Republican candidate\" and appealed to the party for support. The\\n', 'controversy over the tariff had grown into a formidable revolt against\\n', 'the occupant of the White House.\\n', '\\n', '=Roosevelt in the Field.=--After looking on for a while, ex-President\\n', 'Roosevelt took a hand in the fray. Soon after his return in 1910 from a\\n', 'hunting trip in Africa and a tour in Europe, he made a series of\\n', 'addresses in which he formulated a progressive program. In a speech in\\n', 'Kansas, he favored regulation of the trusts, a graduated income tax\\n', 'bearing heavily on great fortunes, tariff revision schedule by schedule,\\n', 'conservation of natural resources, labor legislation, the direct\\n', 'primary, and the recall of elective officials. In an address before the\\n', 'Ohio state constitutional convention in February, 1912, he indorsed the\\n', 'initiative and referendum and announced a doctrine known as the \"recall\\n', 'of judicial decisions.\" This was a new and radical note in American\\n', 'politics. An ex-President of the United States proposed that the people\\n', 'at the polls should have the right to reverse the decision of a judge\\n', 'who set aside any act of a state legislature passed in the interests of\\n', 'social welfare. The Progressive Republicans, impressed by these\\n', 'addresses, turned from La Follette to Roosevelt and on February 24,\\n', 'induced him to come out openly as a candidate against Taft for the\\n', 'Republican nomination.\\n', '\\n', '=The Split in the Republican Party.=--The country then witnessed the\\n', 'strange spectacle of two men who had once been close companions engaged\\n', 'in a bitter rivalry to secure a majority of the delegates to the\\n', 'Republican convention to be held at Chicago. When the convention\\n', 'assembled, about one-fourth of the seats were contested, the delegates\\n', 'for both candidates loudly proclaiming the regularity of their election.\\n', 'In deciding between the contestants the national committee, after the\\n', 'usual hearings, settled the disputes in such a way that Taft received a\\n', 'safe majority. After a week of negotiation, Roosevelt and his followers\\n', 'left the Republican party. Most of his supporters withdrew from the\\n', 'convention and the few who remained behind refused to answer the roll\\n', 'call. Undisturbed by this formidable bolt, the regular Republicans went\\n', 'on with their work. They renominated Mr. Taft and put forth a platform\\n', 'roundly condemning such Progressive doctrines as the recall of judges.\\n', '\\n', '=The Formation of the Progressive Party.=--The action of the Republicans\\n', 'in seating the Taft delegates was vigorously denounced by Roosevelt. He\\n', 'declared that the convention had no claim to represent the voters of the\\n', 'Republican party; that any candidate named by it would be \"the\\n', 'beneficiary of a successful fraud\"; and that it would be deeply\\n', \"discreditable to any man to accept the convention's approval under such\\n\", 'circumstances. The bitterness of his followers was extreme. On July 8, a\\n', 'call went forth for a \"Progressive\" convention to be held in Chicago on\\n', 'August 5. The assembly which duly met on that day was a unique political\\n', 'conference. Prominence was given to women delegates, and \"politicians\"\\n', 'were notably absent. Roosevelt himself, who was cheered as a conquering\\n', 'hero, made an impassioned speech setting forth his \"confession of\\n', 'faith.\" He was nominated by acclamation; Governor Hiram Johnson of\\n', 'California was selected as his companion candidate for Vice President.\\n', 'The platform endorsed such political reforms as woman suffrage, direct\\n', 'primaries, the initiative, referendum, and recall, popular election of\\n', 'United States Senators, and the short ballot. It favored a program of\\n', 'social legislation, including the prohibition of child labor and minimum\\n', 'wages for women. It approved the regulation, rather than the\\n', 'dissolution, of the trusts. Like apostles in a new and lofty cause, the\\n', 'Progressives entered a vigorous campaign for the election of their\\n', 'distinguished leader.\\n', '\\n', '=Woodrow Wilson and the Election of 1912.=--With the Republicans\\n', 'divided, victory loomed up before the Democrats. Naturally, a terrific\\n', 'contest over the nomination occurred at their convention in Baltimore.\\n', 'Champ Clark, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Governor\\n', 'Woodrow Wilson, of New Jersey, were the chief contestants. After tossing\\n', 'to and fro for seven long, hot days, and taking forty-six ballots, the\\n', 'delegates, powerfully influenced by Mr. Bryan, finally decided in favor\\n', 'of the governor. As a professor, a writer on historical and political\\n', 'subjects, and the president of Princeton University, Mr. Wilson had\\n', 'become widely known in public life. As the governor of New Jersey he had\\n', 'attracted the support of the progressives in both parties. With grim\\n', 'determination he had \"waged war on the bosses,\" and pushed through the\\n', 'legislature measures establishing direct primaries, regulating public\\n', \"utilities, and creating a system of workmen's compensation in\\n\", 'industries. During the presidential campaign that followed Governor\\n', 'Wilson toured the country and aroused great enthusiasm by a series of\\n', 'addresses later published under the title of _The New Freedom_. He\\n', 'declared that \"the government of the United States is at present the\\n', 'foster child of the special interests.\" He proposed to free the country\\n', 'by breaking the dominance of \"the big bankers, the big manufacturers,\\n', 'the big masters of commerce, the heads of railroad corporations and of\\n', 'steamship corporations.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In the election Governor Wilson easily secured a majority of the\\n', 'electoral votes, and his party, while retaining possession of the House\\n', 'of Representatives, captured the Senate as well. The popular verdict,\\n', 'however, indicated a state of confusion in the country. The combined\\n', 'Progressive and Republican vote exceeded that of the Democrats by\\n', 'polled about 900,000 votes, more than double the number received four\\n', 'years before. Thus, as the result of an extraordinary upheaval the\\n', 'Republicans, after holding the office of President for sixteen years,\\n', 'passed out of power, and the government of the country was intrusted to\\n', 'the Democrats under the leadership of a man destined to be one of the\\n', 'outstanding figures of the modern age, Woodrow Wilson.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=General References=\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Theodore Roosevelt, _Autobiography_; _New Nationalism_; _Progressive\\n', 'Principles_.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Walter Weyl, _The New Democracy_.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Gifford Pinchot, _The Fight for Conservation_.\\n', '\\n', '(1905).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Research Topics=\\n', '\\n', '=Roosevelt and \"Big Business.\"=--Haworth, _The United States in Our Own\\n', 'Series), pp. 40-75; Paxson, _The New Nation_ (Riverside Series), pp.\\n', '293-307.\\n', '\\n', '=Our Insular Possessions.=--Elson, _History of the United States_, pp.\\n', '896-904.\\n', '\\n', '=Latin-American Relations.=--Haworth, pp. 294-299; Ogg, pp. 254-257.\\n', '\\n', '=The Panama Canal.=--Haworth, pp. 300-309; Ogg, pp. 266-277; Paxson, pp.\\n', '286-292; Elson, pp. 906-911.\\n', '\\n', '=Conservation.=--Haworth, pp. 331-334; Ogg, pp. 96-115; Beard, _American\\n', 'Government and Politics_ (3d ed.), pp. 401-416.\\n', '\\n', \"=Republican Dissensions under Taft's Administration.=--Haworth, pp.\\n\", '351-360; Ogg, pp. 167-186; Paxson, pp. 324-342; Elson, pp. 916-924.\\n', '\\n', '=The Campaign of 1912.=--Haworth, pp. 360-379; Ogg, pp. 187-208.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Questions=\\n', '\\n', '1.

It had been\\n', 'long in preparation. The revolt against corruption in politics which\\n', 'produced the Liberal Republican outbreak in the seventies and the\\n', 'Mugwump movement of the eighties was followed by continuous criticism of\\n', 'American political and economic development. From 1880 until his death\\n', 'in 1892, George William Curtis, as president of the Civil Service Reform\\n', 'Association, kept up a running fire upon the abuses of the spoils\\n', 'system. James Bryce, an observant English scholar and man of affairs, in\\n', 'his great work, _The American Commonwealth_, published in 1888, by\\n', 'picturing fearlessly the political rings and machines which dominated\\n', 'the cities, gave the whole country a fresh shock. Six years later Henry\\n', 'attacked in scathing language certain trusts which had destroyed their\\n', 'rivals and bribed public officials. In 1903 Miss Ida Tarbell, an author\\n', 'of established reputation in the historical field, gave to the public an\\n', 'account of the Standard Oil Company, revealing the ruthless methods of\\n', 'that corporation in crushing competition. About the same time Lincoln\\n', 'Steffens exposed the sordid character of politics in several\\n', 'municipalities in a series of articles bearing the painful heading: _The\\n', 'Shame of the Cities_. The critical spirit appeared in almost every form;\\n', 'in weekly and monthly magazines, in essays and pamphlets, in editorials\\n', \"and news stories, in novels like Churchill's _Coniston_ and Sinclair's\\n\", '_The Jungle_. It became so savage and so wanton that the opening years\\n', 'of the twentieth century were well named \"the age of the muckrakers.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Subjects of the Criticism.=--In this outburst of invective, nothing\\n', 'was spared. It was charged that each of the political parties had fallen\\n', 'into the hands of professional politicians who devoted their time to\\n', 'managing conventions, making platforms, nominating candidates, and\\n', 'dictating to officials; in return for their \"services\" they sold offices\\n', 'and privileges. It was alleged that mayors and councils had bargained\\n', 'away for private benefit street railway and other franchises. It was\\n', 'asserted that many powerful labor unions were dominated by men who\\n', 'blackmailed employers. Some critics specialized in descriptions of the\\n', 'poverty, slums, and misery of great cities. Others took up \"frenzied\\n', 'finance\" and accused financiers of selling worthless stocks and bonds to\\n', 'an innocent public. Still others professed to see in the accumulations\\n', 'of millionaires the downfall of our republic.\\n', '\\n', '=The Attack on \"Invisible Government.\"=--Some even maintained that the\\n', 'control of public affairs had passed from the people to a sinister\\n', 'minority called \"the invisible government.\" So eminent and conservative\\n', 'a statesman as the Hon. Elihu Root lent the weight of his great name to\\n', 'such an imputation. Speaking of his native state, New York, he said:\\n', '\"What is the government of this state? What has it been during the forty\\n', 'years of my acquaintance with it? The government of the Constitution?\\n', 'Oh, no; not half the time or half way.... From the days of Fenton and\\n', 'Hill down to the present time, the government of the state has presented\\n', 'two different lines of activity: one, of the constitutional and\\n', 'statutory officers of the state and the other of the party leaders; they\\n', 'how many years Mr. Conkling was the supreme ruler in this state. The\\n', 'governor did not count, the legislature did not count, comptrollers and\\n', 'secretaries of state and what not did not count. It was what Mr.\\n', 'Conkling said, and in a great outburst of public rage he was pulled\\n', 'down. Then Mr. Platt ruled the state; for nigh upon twenty years he\\n', 'ruled it. It was not the governor; it was not the legislature; it was\\n', 'Mr. Platt. And the capital was not here [in Albany]; it was at 49\\n', 'Broadway; Mr. Platt and his lieutenants. It makes no difference what\\n', 'name you give, whether you call it Fenton or Conkling or Cornell or\\n', 'Arthur or Platt or by the names of men now living. The ruler of the\\n', 'state during the greater part of the forty years of my acquaintance with\\n', 'the state government has not been any man authorized by the constitution\\n', 'or by law.... The party leader is elected by no one, accountable to no\\n', 'one, bound by no oath of office, removable by no one.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Nation Aroused.=--With the spirit of criticism came also the spirit\\n', 'of reform. The charges were usually exaggerated; often wholly false; but\\n', 'there was enough truth in them to warrant renewed vigilance on the part\\n', 'of American democracy. President Roosevelt doubtless summed up the\\n', 'sentiment of the great majority of citizens when he demanded the\\n', 'punishment of wrong-doers in 1907, saying: \"It makes not a particle of\\n', 'difference whether these crimes are committed by a capitalist or by a\\n', 'laborer, by a leading banker or manufacturer or railroad man or by a\\n', 'leading representative of a labor union. Swindling in stocks, corrupting\\n', 'legislatures, making fortunes by the inflation of securities, by\\n', 'wrecking railroads, by destroying competitors through rebates--these\\n', 'forms of wrong-doing in the capitalist are far more infamous than any\\n', 'ordinary form of embezzlement or forgery.\" The time had come, he added,\\n', 'to stop \"muckraking\" and proceed to the constructive work of removing\\n', 'the abuses that had grown up.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Public Service.=--It was a wise comprehension of the needs of\\n', 'American democracy that led the friends of reform to launch and to\\n', 'sustain for more than half a century a movement to improve the public\\n', 'service. On the one side they struck at the spoils system; at the right\\n', 'of the politicians to use public offices as mere rewards for partisan\\n', 'work. The federal civil service act of 1883 opened the way to reform by\\n', 'establishing five vital principles in law: (1) admission to office, not\\n', 'on the recommendation of party workers, but on the basis of competitive\\n', 'examinations; (2) promotion for meritorious service of the government\\n', 'funds; (4) permanent tenure during good behavior; and (5) no dismissals\\n', 'for political reasons. The act itself at first applied to only 14,000\\n', 'federal offices, but under the constant pressure from the reformers it\\n', 'was extended until in 1916 it covered nearly 300,000 employees out of an\\n', 'executive force of approximately 414,000. While gaining steadily at\\n', 'Washington, civil service reformers carried their agitation into the\\n', 'states and cities. By 1920 they were able to report ten states with\\n', 'civil service commissions and the merit system well intrenched in more\\n', 'than three hundred municipalities.\\n', '\\n', 'In excluding spoilsmen from public office, the reformers were, in a\\n', 'sense, engaged in a negative work: that of \"keeping the rascals out.\"\\n', 'But there was a second and larger phase to their movement, one\\n', 'constructive in character: that of getting skilled, loyal, and efficient\\n', 'servants into the places of responsibility. Everywhere on land and sea,\\n', 'in town and country, new burdens were laid upon public officers. They\\n', 'were called upon to supervise the ships sailing to and from our ports;\\n', 'to inspect the water and milk supplies of our cities; to construct and\\n', 'operate great public works, such as the Panama and Erie canals; to\\n', 'regulate the complicated rates of railway companies; to safeguard health\\n', 'and safety in a thousand ways; to climb the mountains to fight forest\\n', 'fires; and to descend into the deeps of the earth to combat the deadly\\n', 'coal gases that assail the miners. In a word, those who labored to\\n', 'master the secrets and the powers of nature were summoned to the aid of\\n', 'the government: chemists, engineers, architects, nurses, surgeons,\\n', 'foresters--the skilled in all the sciences, arts, and crafts.\\n', '\\n', 'Keeping rascals out was no task at all compared with the problem of\\n', 'finding competent people for all the technical offices. \"Now,\" said the\\n', 'reformers, \"we must make attractive careers in the government work for\\n', 'the best American talent; we must train those applying for admission and\\n', 'increase the skill of those already in positions of trust; we must see\\n', 'to it that those entering at the bottom have a chance to rise to the\\n', 'top; in short, we must work for a government as skilled and efficient as\\n', 'it is strong, one commanding all the wisdom and talent of America that\\n', 'public welfare requires.\"\\n', '\\n', 'machines was made in connection with the ballot. In the early days\\n', 'elections were frequently held in the open air and the poll was taken by\\n', 'a show of hands or by the enrollment of the voters under names of their\\n', 'favorite candidates. When this ancient practice was abandoned in favor\\n', 'of the printed ballot, there was still no secrecy about elections. Each\\n', 'party prepared its own ballot, often of a distinctive color, containing\\n', 'the names of its candidates. On election day, these papers were handed\\n', 'out to the voters by party workers. Any one could tell from the color of\\n', 'the ballot dropped into the box, or from some mark on the outside of the\\n', 'folded ballot, just how each man voted. Those who bought votes were sure\\n', 'that their purchases were \"delivered.\" Those who intimidated voters\\n', 'could know when their intimidation was effective. In this way the party\\n', 'ballot strengthened the party machine.\\n', '\\n', 'As a remedy for such abuses, reformers, learning from the experience of\\n', 'Australia, urged the adoption of the \"Australian ballot.\" That ballot,\\n', 'though it appeared in many forms, had certain constant features. It was\\n', 'official, that is, furnished by the government, not by party workers; it\\n', 'contained the names of all candidates of all parties; it was given out\\n', 'only in the polling places; and it was marked in secret. The first state\\n', 'to introduce it was Massachusetts. The year was 1888. Before the end of\\n', 'the century it had been adopted by nearly all the states in the union.\\n', 'The salutary effect of the reform in reducing the amount of cheating\\n', 'and bribery in elections was beyond all question.\\n', '\\n', '=The Direct Primary.=--In connection with the uprising against machine\\n', 'politics, came a call for the abolition of the old method of nominating\\n', 'candidates by conventions. These time-honored party assemblies, which\\n', 'had come down from the days of Andrew Jackson, were, it was said, merely\\n', 'conclaves of party workers, sustained by the spoils system, and\\n', 'dominated by an inner circle of bosses. The remedy offered in this case\\n', 'was again \"more democracy,\" namely, the abolition of the party\\n', 'convention and the adoption of the direct primary. Candidates were no\\n', 'longer to be chosen by secret conferences. Any member of a party was to\\n', 'be allowed to run for any office, to present his name to his party by\\n', 'securing signatures to a petition, and to submit his candidacy to his\\n', 'fellow partisans at a direct primary--an election within the party. In\\n', 'this movement Governor La Follette of Wisconsin took the lead and his\\n', 'state was the first in the union to adopt the direct primary for\\n', 'state-wide purposes. The idea spread, rapidly in the West, more slowly\\n', 'in the East. The public, already angered against \"the bosses,\" grasped\\n', 'eagerly at it. Governor Hughes in New York pressed it upon the unwilling\\n', 'legislature. State after state accepted it until by 1918 Rhode Island,\\n', 'Delaware, Connecticut, and New Mexico were the only states that had not\\n', 'bowed to the storm. Still the results were disappointing and at that\\n', 'very time the pendulum was beginning to swing backward.\\n', '\\n', '=Popular Election of Federal Senators.=--While the movement for direct\\n', 'primaries was still advancing everywhere, a demand for the popular\\n', 'election of Senators, usually associated with it, swept forward to\\n', 'victory. Under the original Constitution, it had been expressly provided\\n', 'that Senators should be chosen by the legislatures of the states. In\\n', 'practice this rule transferred the selection of Senators to secret\\n', 'caucuses of party members in the state legislatures. In connection with\\n', 'these caucuses there had been many scandals, some direct proofs of\\n', 'brazen bribery and corruption, and dark hints besides. The Senate was\\n', 'called by its detractors \"a millionaires\\' club\" and it was looked upon\\n', 'as the \"citadel of conservatism.\" The prescription in this case was\\n', 'likewise \"more democracy\"--direct election of Senators by popular vote.\\n', '\\n', 'This reform was not a new idea. It had been proposed in Congress as\\n', 'early as 1826. President Johnson, an ardent advocate, made it the\\n', 'subject of a special message in 1868 Not long afterward it appeared in\\n', 'Congress. At last in 1893, the year after the great Populist upheaval,\\n', 'the House of Representatives by the requisite two-thirds vote\\n', 'incorporated it in an amendment to the federal Constitution. Again and\\n', 'again it passed the House; but the Senate itself was obdurate. Able\\n', 'Senators leveled their batteries against it. Mr. Hoar of Massachusetts\\n', 'declared that it would transfer the seat of power to the \"great cities\\n', 'and masses of population\"; that it would \"overthrow the whole scheme of\\n', 'the Senate and in the end the whole scheme of the national Constitution\\n', 'as designed and established by the framers of the Constitution and the\\n', 'people who adopted it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Failing in the Senate, advocates of popular election made a rear assault\\n', 'through the states. They induced state legislatures to enact laws\\n', 'requiring the nomination of candidates for the Senate by the direct\\n', 'primary, and then they bound the legislatures to abide by the popular\\n', 'choice. Nevada took the lead in 1899. Shortly afterward Oregon, by the\\n', 'use of the initiative and referendum, practically bound legislators to\\n', 'accept the popular nominee and the country witnessed the spectacle of a\\n', 'Republican legislature \"electing\" a Democrat to represent the state in\\n', 'the Senate at Washington. By 1910 three-fourths of the states had\\n', 'applied the direct primary in some form to the choice of Senators. Men\\n', 'selected by that method began to pour in upon the floors of Congress;\\n', 'finally in 1912 the two-thirds majority was secured for an amendment to\\n', 'the federal Constitution providing for the popular election of Senators.\\n', 'It was quickly ratified by the states. The following year it was\\n', 'proclaimed in effect.\\n', '\\n', '=The Initiative and Referendum.=--As a corrective for the evils which\\n', 'had grown up in state legislatures there arose a demand for the\\n', 'introduction of a Swiss device known as the initiative and referendum.\\n', 'The initiative permits any one to draw up a proposed bill; and, on\\n', 'securing a certain number of signatures among the voters, to require the\\n', 'submission of the measure to the people at an election. If the bill thus\\n', 'initiated receives a sufficient majority, it becomes a law. The\\n', 'referendum allows citizens who disapprove any act passed by the\\n', 'legislature to get up a petition against it and thus bring about a\\n', 'reference of the measure to the voters at the polls for approval or\\n', 'rejection. These two practices constitute a form of \"direct government.\"\\n', '\\n', 'These devices were prescribed \"to restore the government to the people.\"\\n', 'The Populists favored them in their platform of 1896. Mr. Bryan, two\\n', 'years later, made them a part of his program, and in the same year South\\n', 'Dakota adopted them. In 1902 Oregon, after a strenuous campaign, added a\\n', 'direct legislation amendment to the state constitution. Within ten years\\n', 'all the Southwestern, Mountain, and Pacific states, except Texas and\\n', 'Wyoming, had followed this example. To the east of the Mississippi,\\n', 'however, direct legislation met a chilly reception. By 1920 only five\\n', 'states in this section had accepted it: Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio,\\n', 'Michigan, and Maryland, the last approving the referendum only.\\n', '\\n', '=The Recall.=--Executive officers and judges, as well as legislatures,\\n', 'had come in for their share of criticism, and it was proposed that they\\n', 'should likewise be subjected to a closer scrutiny by the public. For\\n', 'this purpose there was advanced a scheme known as the recall--which\\n', 'permitted a certain percentage of the voters to compel any officer, at\\n', 'any time during his term, to go before the people at a new election.\\n', 'This feature of direct government, tried out first in the city of Los\\n', 'Angeles, was extended to state-wide uses in Oregon in 1908. It failed,\\n', 'however, to capture popular imagination to the same degree as the\\n', \"initiative and referendum. At the end of ten years' agitation, only ten\\n\", 'states, mainly in the West, had adopted it for general purposes, and\\n', 'four of them did not apply it to the judges of the courts. Still it was\\n', 'extensively acclaimed in cities and incorporated into hundreds of\\n', 'municipal laws and charters.\\n', '\\n', 'As a general proposition, direct government in all its forms was\\n', 'bitterly opposed by men of a conservative cast of mind. It was denounced\\n', 'by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge as \"nothing less than a complete revolution\\n', 'in the fabric of our government and in the fundamental principles upon\\n', 'which that government rests.\" In his opinion, it promised to break down\\n', 'the representative principle and \"undermine and overthrow the bulwarks\\n', 'of ordered liberty and individual freedom.\" Mr. Taft shared Mr. Lodge\\'s\\n', 'views and spoke of direct government with scorn. \"Votes,\" he exclaimed,\\n', '\"are not bread ... referendums do not pay rent or furnish houses,\\n', 'recalls do not furnish clothes, initiatives do not supply employment or\\n', 'relieve inequalities of condition or of opportunity.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Commission Government for Cities.=--In the restless searching out of\\n', 'evils, the management of cities early came under critical scrutiny. City\\n', 'government, Mr. Bryce had remarked, was the one conspicuous failure in\\n', 'America. This sharp thrust, though resented by some, was accepted as a\\n', 'warning by others. Many prescriptions were offered by doctors of the\\n', 'body politic. Chief among them was the idea of simplifying the city\\n', 'government so that the light of public scrutiny could shine through it.\\n', '\"Let us elect only a few men and make them clearly responsible for the\\n', 'city government!\" was the new cry in municipal reform. So, many city\\n', 'councils were reduced in size; one of the two houses, which several\\n', 'cities had adopted in imitation of the federal government, was\\n', 'abolished; and in order that the mayor could be held to account, he was\\n', 'given the power to appoint all the chief officials. This made the mayor,\\n', 'in some cases, the only elective city official and gave the voters a\\n', '\"short ballot\" containing only a few names--an idea which some proposed\\n', 'to apply also to the state government.\\n', '\\n', 'Texas, where the people, looking upon the ruin of their city wrought by\\n', 'the devastating storm of 1901, and confronted by the difficult problems\\n', 'of reconstruction, felt the necessity for a more businesslike management\\n', 'of city affairs and instituted a new form of local administration. They\\n', 'abolished the old scheme of mayor and council and vested all power in\\n', 'five commissioners, one of whom, without any special prerogatives, was\\n', 'assigned to the office of \"mayor president.\" In 1908, the commission\\n', 'form of government, as it was soon characterized, was adopted by Des\\n', 'Moines, Iowa. The attention of all municipal reformers was drawn to it\\n', 'and it was hailed as the guarantee of a better day. By 1920, more than\\n', 'four hundred cities, including Memphis, Spokane, Birmingham, Newark, and\\n', 'Buffalo, had adopted it. Still the larger cities like New York and\\n', 'Chicago kept their boards of aldermen.\\n', '\\n', 'government revealed certain patent defects. The division of the work\\n', 'among five men was frequently found to introduce dissensions and\\n', 'irresponsibility. Commissioners were often lacking in the technical\\n', 'ability required to manage such difficult matters as fire and police\\n', 'protection, public health, public works, and public utilities. Some one\\n', 'then proposed to carry over into city government an idea from the\\n', 'business world. In that sphere the stockholders of each corporation\\n', 'elect the directors and the directors, in turn, choose a business\\n', 'manager to conduct the affairs of the company. It was suggested that the\\n', 'city commissioners, instead of attempting to supervise the details of\\n', 'the city administration, should select a manager to do this. The scheme\\n', 'was put into effect in Sumter, South Carolina, in 1912. Like the\\n', 'commission plan, it became popular. Within eight years more than one\\n', 'hundred and fifty towns and cities had adopted it. Among the larger\\n', 'municipalities were Dayton, Springfield (Ohio), Akron, Kalamazoo, and\\n', 'Phoenix. It promised to create a new public service profession, that of\\n', 'city manager.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Spirit of American Reform.=--The purification of the ballot, the\\n', 'restriction of the spoils system, the enlargement of direct popular\\n', 'control over the organs of government were not the sole answers made by\\n', 'the reformers to the critics of American institutions. Nor were they the\\n', 'most important. In fact, they were regarded not as ends in themselves,\\n', 'but as means to serve a wider purpose. That purpose was the promotion of\\n', 'the \"general welfare.\" The concrete objects covered by that broad term\\n', 'were many and varied; but they included the prevention of extortion by\\n', 'railway and other corporations, the protection of public health, the\\n', 'extension of education, the improvement of living conditions in the\\n', 'cities, the elimination of undeserved poverty, the removal of gross\\n', 'inequalities in wealth, and more equality of opportunity.\\n', '\\n', 'All these things involved the use of the powers of government. Although\\n', 'a few clung to the ancient doctrine that the government should not\\n', 'interfere with private business at all, the American people at large\\n', 'rejected that theory as vigorously as they rejected the doctrines of an\\n', 'extreme socialism which exalts the state above the individual. Leaders\\n', 'representing every shade of opinion proclaimed the government an\\n', 'instrument of common welfare to be used in the public interest. \"We must\\n', 'abandon definitely,\" said Roosevelt, \"the _laissez-faire_ theory of\\n', 'political economy and fearlessly champion a system of increased\\n', 'governmental control, paying no attention to the cries of worthy people\\n', 'who denounce this as socialistic.\" This view was shared by Mr. Taft, who\\n', 'observed: \"Undoubtedly the government can wisely do much more ... to\\n', 'relieve the oppressed, to create greater equality of opportunity, to\\n', 'make reasonable terms for labor in employment, and to furnish vocational\\n', 'education.\" He was quick to add his caution that \"there is a line beyond\\n', 'which the government cannot go with any good practical results in\\n', 'seeking to make men and society better.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Regulation of Railways.=--The first attempts to use the government\\n', 'in a large way to control private enterprise in the public interest were\\n', 'made by the Northwestern states in the decade between 1870 and 1880.\\n', 'Charges were advanced by the farmers, particularly those organized into\\n', 'Granges, that the railways extorted the highest possible rates for\\n', 'freight and passengers, that favoritism was shown to large shippers,\\n', 'that fraudulent stocks and bonds were sold to the innocent public. It\\n', 'was claimed that railways were not like other enterprises, but were\\n', '\"quasi-public\" concerns, like the roads and ferries, and thus subject to\\n', 'government control. Accordingly laws were enacted bringing the railroads\\n', 'under state supervision. In some cases the state legislature fixed the\\n', 'maximum rates to be charged by common carriers, and in other cases\\n', 'commissions were created with the power to establish the rates after an\\n', 'investigation. This legislation was at first denounced in the East as\\n', 'nothing less than the \"confiscation\" of the railways in the interest of\\n', 'the farmers. Attempts to have the Supreme Court of the United States\\n', 'declare it unconstitutional were made without avail; still a principle\\n', 'was finally laid down to the effect that in fixing rates state\\n', 'legislatures and commissions must permit railway companies to earn a\\n', '\"fair\" return on the capital invested.\\n', '\\n', 'In a few years the Granger spirit appeared in Congress. An investigation\\n', 'revealed a long list of abuses committed by the railways against\\n', 'shippers and travelers. The result was the interstate commerce act of\\n', '1887, which created the Interstate Commerce Commission, forbade\\n', 'discriminations in rates, and prohibited other objectionable practices\\n', 'on the part of railways. This measure was loosely enforced and the\\n', 'for stricter control grew louder and louder. Congress was forced to\\n', 'heed. In 1903 it enacted the Elkins law, forbidding railways to charge\\n', 'rates other than those published, and laid penalties upon the officers\\n', 'and agents of companies, who granted secret favors to shippers, and upon\\n', 'shippers who accepted them. Three years later a still more drastic step\\n', 'was taken by the passage of the Hepburn act. The Interstate Commerce\\n', 'Commission was authorized, upon complaint of some party aggrieved, and\\n', 'after a public hearing, to determine whether just and reasonable rates\\n', 'had been charged by the companies. In effect, the right to fix freight\\n', 'and passenger rates was taken out of the hands of the owners of the\\n', 'railways engaged in interstate commerce and vested in the hands of the\\n', 'Interstate Commerce Commission. Thus private property to the value of\\n', '$20,000,000,000 or more was declared to be a matter of public concern\\n', 'and subject to government regulation in the common interest.\\n', '\\n', '=Municipal Utilities.=--Similar problems arose in connection with the\\n', 'street railways, electric light plants, and other utilities in the great\\n', 'cities. In the beginning the right to construct such undertakings was\\n', 'freely, and often corruptly, granted to private companies by city\\n', 'councils. Distressing abuses arose in connection with such practices.\\n', 'Many grants or franchises were made perpetual, or perhaps for a term of\\n', '999 years. The rates charged and services rendered were left largely to\\n', 'the will of the companies holding the franchises. Mergers or unions of\\n', 'companies were common and the public was deluged with stocks and bonds\\n', 'of doubtful value; bankruptcies were frequent. The connection between\\n', 'the utility companies and the politicians was, to say the least, not\\n', 'always in the public interest.\\n', '\\n', 'American ingenuity was quick to devise methods for eliminating such\\n', 'evils. Three lines of progress were laid out by the reformers. One group\\n', 'proposed that such utilities should be subject to municipal or state\\n', 'regulation, that the formation of utility companies should be under\\n', 'public control, and that the issue of stocks and bonds must be approved\\n', 'by public authority. In some cases state, and in other cases municipal,\\n', 'commissions were created to exercise this great power over \"quasi-public\\n', 'corporations.\" Wisconsin, by laws enacted in 1907, put all heat, light,\\n', 'water works, telephone, and street railway companies under the\\n', 'supervision of a single railway commission. Other states followed this\\n', 'example rapidly. By 1920 the principle of public control over municipal\\n', 'utilities was accepted in nearly every section of the union.\\n', '\\n', 'corporations. An illustration of this tendency was afforded by the\\n', 'Chicago street railway settlement of 1906. The total capital of the\\n', 'company was fixed at a definite sum, its earnings were agreed upon, and\\n', 'the city was given the right to buy and operate the system if it desired\\n', 'to do so. In many states, about the same time, it was provided that no\\n', 'franchises to utility companies could run more than twenty-five years.\\n', '\\n', 'municipal ownership. They proposed to drive private companies entirely\\n', 'out of the field and vest the ownership and management of municipal\\n', 'plants in the city itself. This idea was extensively applied to electric\\n', 'light and water works plants, but to street railways in only a few\\n', 'cities, including San Francisco and Seattle. In New York the subways are\\n', 'owned by the city but leased for operation.\\n', '\\n', '=Tenement House Control.=--Among the other pressing problems of the\\n', 'cities was the overcrowding in houses unfit for habitation. An inquiry\\n', 'in New York City made under the authority of the state in 1902 revealed\\n', 'poverty, misery, slums, dirt, and disease almost beyond imagination. The\\n', 'immediate answer was the enactment of a tenement house law prescribing\\n', 'in great detail the size of the rooms, the air space, the light and the\\n', 'sanitary arrangement for all new buildings. An immense improvement\\n', 'followed and the idea was quickly taken up in other states having large\\n', 'industrial centers. In 1920 New York made a further invasion of the\\n', 'rights of landlords by assuring to the public \"reasonable rents\" for\\n', 'flats and apartments.\\n', '\\n', \"=Workmen's Compensation.=--No small part of the poverty in cities was\\n\", 'due to the injury of wage-earners while at their trade. Every year the\\n', 'number of men and women killed or wounded in industry mounted higher.\\n', 'Under the old law, the workman or his family had to bear the loss unless\\n', 'the employer had been guilty of some extraordinary negligence. Even in\\n', 'that case an expensive lawsuit was usually necessary to recover\\n', '\"damages.\" In short, although employers insured their buildings and\\n', 'machinery against necessary risks from fire and storm, they allowed\\n', 'their employees to assume the heavy losses due to accidents. The\\n', 'injustice of this, though apparent enough now, was once not generally\\n', 'recognized. It was said to be unfair to make the employer pay for\\n', 'injuries for which he was not personally responsible; but the argument\\n', 'was overborne.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'About 1910 there set in a decided movement in the direction of lifting\\n', 'the burden of accidents from the unfortunate victims. In the first\\n', 'place, laws were enacted requiring employers to pay damages in certain\\n', 'amounts according to the nature of the case, no matter how the accident\\n', 'occurred, as long as the injured person was not guilty of willful\\n', 'negligence. By 1914 more than one-half the states had such laws. In the\\n', 'second place, there developed schemes of industrial insurance in the\\n', 'form of automatic grants made by state commissions to persons injured in\\n', 'industries, the funds to be provided by the employers or the state or by\\n', 'both. By 1917 thirty-six states had legislation of this type.\\n', '\\n', \"=Minimum Wages and Mothers' Pensions.=--Another source of poverty,\\n\", 'especially among women and children, was found to be the low wages paid\\n', 'for their labor. Report after report showed this. In 1912 Massachusetts\\n', 'took a significant step in the direction of declaring the minimum wages\\n', 'which might be paid to women and children. Oregon, the following year,\\n', 'created a commission with power to prescribe minimum wages in certain\\n', 'industries, based on the cost of living, and to enforce the rates fixed.\\n', 'Within a short time one-third of the states had legislation of this\\n', 'character. To cut away some of the evils of poverty and enable widows to\\n', 'keep their homes intact and bring up their children, a device known as\\n', \"mothers' pensions became popular during the second decade of the\\n\", 'twentieth century. At the opening of 1913 two states, Colorado and\\n', 'Illinois, had laws authorizing the payment from public funds of definite\\n', 'sums to widows with children. Within four years, thirty-five states had\\n', 'similar legislation.\\n', '\\n', '=Taxation and Great Fortunes.=--As a part of the campaign waged against\\n', 'poverty by reformers there came a demand for heavy taxes upon great\\n', 'fortunes, particularly taxes upon inheritances or estates passing to\\n', 'heirs on the decease of the owners. Roosevelt was an ardent champion of\\n', 'this type of taxation and dwelt upon it at length in his message to\\n', 'Congress in 1907. \"Such a tax,\" he said, \"would help to preserve a\\n', 'measurable equality of opportunity for the people of the generations\\n', 'growing to manhood.... Our aim is to recognize what Lincoln pointed out:\\n', 'the fact that there are some respects in which men are obviously not\\n', 'equal; but also to insist that there should be equality of self-respect\\n', 'and of mutual respect, an equality of rights before the law, and at\\n', 'least an approximate equality in the conditions under which each man\\n', 'obtains the chance to show the stuff that is in him when compared with\\n', 'his fellows.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The spirit of the new age was, therefore, one of reform, not of\\n', 'revolution. It called for no evolutionary or utopian experiments, but\\n', 'for the steady and progressive enactment of measures aimed at admitted\\n', 'abuses and designed to accomplish tangible results in the name of public\\n', 'welfare.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=General References=\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '_The American Year Book_ (an annual publication which contains reviews\\n', 'of reform legislation).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Research Topics=\\n', '\\n', '=\"The Muckrakers.\"=--Paxson, _The New Nation_ (Riverside Series), pp.\\n', '309-323.\\n', '\\n', '=Civil Service Reform.=--Beard, _American Government and Politics_ (3d\\n', 'ed.), pp. 222-230; Ogg, _National Progress_ (American Nation Series),\\n', 'pp. 135-142.\\n', '\\n', '=Direct Government.=--Beard, _American Government_, pp. 461-473; Ogg,\\n', 'pp. 160-166.\\n', '\\n', '=Popular Election of Senators.=--Beard, _American Government_, pp.\\n', '241-244; Ogg, pp. 149-150.\\n', '\\n', '=Party Methods.=--Beard, _American Government_, pp. 656-672.\\n', '\\n', '=Ballot Reform.=--Beard, _American Government_, pp. 672-705.\\n', '\\n', '=Social and Economic Legislation.=--Beard, _American Government_, pp.\\n', '721-752.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Questions=\\n', '\\n', '1.

Where they did not\\n', 'lead, they were affiliated with movements for social improvement. No\\n', 'cause escaped their attention; no year passed without widening the range\\n', 'of their interests. They served on committees that inquired into the\\n', 'problems of the day; they appeared before legislative assemblies to\\n', 'advocate remedies for the evils they discovered. By 1912 they were a\\n', 'force to be reckoned with in national politics. In nine states complete\\n', 'and equal suffrage had been established, and a widespread campaign for a\\n', 'national suffrage amendment was in full swing. On every hand lay\\n', 'evidences that their sphere had been broadened to include public\\n', 'affairs. This was the culmination of forces that had long been\\n', 'operating.\\n', '\\n', 'interests could not fail to find a place in time in the written record\\n', 'of human progress. History often began as a chronicle of kings and\\n', 'queens, knights and ladies, written partly to amuse and partly to\\n', 'instruct the classes that appeared in its pages. With the growth of\\n', 'commerce, parliaments, and international relations, politics and\\n', 'diplomacy were added to such chronicles of royal and princely doings.\\n', 'After the rise of democracy, industry, and organized labor, the\\n', 'transactions of everyday life were deemed worthy of a place in the pages\\n', 'of history. In each case history was rewritten and the past rediscovered\\n', 'in the light of the new age. So it will be with the rise and growth of\\n', \"women's political power. The history of their labor, their education,\\n\", 'their status in society, their influence on the course of events will be\\n', 'explored and given its place in the general record.\\n', '\\n', 'It will be a history of change. The superior position which women enjoy\\n', 'in America to-day is the result of a slow evolution from an almost\\n', 'rightless condition in colonial times. The founders of America brought\\n', \"with them the English common law. Under that law, a married woman's\\n\", 'personal property--jewels, money, furniture, and the like--became her\\n', \"husband's property; the management of her lands passed into his control.\\n\", 'Even the wages she earned, if she worked for some one else, belonged to\\n', 'him. Custom, if not law, prescribed that women should not take part in\\n', 'town meetings or enter into public discussions of religious questions.\\n', 'Indeed it is a far cry from the banishment of Anne Hutchinson from\\n', 'Massachusetts in 1637, for daring to dispute with the church fathers, to\\n', 'the political conventions of 1920 in which women sat as delegates, made\\n', 'nominating speeches, and served on committees. In the contrast between\\n', 'these two scenes may be measured the change in the privileges of women\\n', 'since the landing of the Pilgrims. The account of this progress is a\\n', 'narrative of individual effort on the part of women, of organizations\\n', 'among them, of generous aid from sympathetic men in the long agitation\\n', 'for the removal of civil and political disabilities. It is in part also\\n', 'a narrative of irresistible economic change which drew women into\\n', 'industry, created a leisure class, gave women wages and incomes, and\\n', 'therewith economic independence.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Protests of Colonial Women.=--The republican spirit which produced\\n', 'American independence was of slow and steady growth. It did not spring\\n', 'up full-armed in a single night. It was, on the contrary, nourished\\n', 'during a long period of time by fireside discussions as well as by\\n', 'debates in the public forum. Women shared that fireside sifting of\\n', 'political principles and passed on the findings of that scrutiny in\\n', 'letters to their friends, newspaper articles, and every form of written\\n', 'word. How widespread was this potent, though not spectacular force, is\\n', \"revealed in the collections of women's letters, articles, songs, dramas,\\n\", 'and satirical \"skits\" on English rule that have come down to us. In this\\n', 'search into the reasons of government, some women began to take thought\\n', 'about laws that excluded them from the ballot. Two women at least left\\n', 'their protests on record. Abigail, the ingenious and witty wife of John\\n', 'Adams, wrote to her husband, in March, 1776, that women objected \"to all\\n', 'arbitrary power whether of state or males\" and demanded political\\n', 'privileges in the new order then being created. Hannah Lee Corbin, the\\n', 'sister of \"Lighthorse\" Harry Lee, protested to her brother against the\\n', 'taxation of women without representation.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Stir among European Women.=--Ferment in America, in the case of\\n', 'women as of men, was quickened by events in Europe. In 1792, Mary\\n', 'Wollstonecraft published in England the _Vindication of the Rights of\\n', 'Women_--a book that was destined to serve the cause of liberty among\\n', 'women as the writings of Locke and Paine had served that of men. The\\n', \"specific grievances which stirred English women were men's invasion of\\n\", \"women's industries, such as spinning and weaving; the denial of equal\\n\", 'educational opportunities; and political disabilities. In France also\\n', 'the great Revolution raised questionings about the status of women. The\\n', 'rights of \"citizenesses\" as well as the rights of \"citizens\" were\\n', 'examined by the boldest thinkers. This in turn reacted upon women in the\\n', 'United States.\\n', '\\n', '=Leadership in America.=--The origins of the American woman movement are\\n', 'to be found in the writings of a few early intellectual leaders. During\\n', 'the first decades of the nineteenth century, books, articles, and\\n', 'pamphlets about women came in increasing numbers from the press. Lydia\\n', 'Maria Child wrote a history of women; Margaret Fuller made a critical\\n', 'examination of the status of women in her time; and Mrs. Elizabeth Ellet\\n', 'supplemented the older histories by showing what an important part women\\n', 'had played in the American Revolution.\\n', '\\n', '=The Struggle for Education.=--Along with criticism, there was carried\\n', 'on a constructive struggle for better educational facilities for women\\n', 'who had been from the beginning excluded from every college in the\\n', 'country. In this long battle, Emma Willard and Mary Lyon led the way;\\n', 'the former founded a seminary at Troy, New York; and the latter made the\\n', 'beginnings of Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. Oberlin College in\\n', 'Ohio, established in 1833, opened its doors to girls and from it were\\n', 'who in 1827 became the editor of a \"Ladies\\' Magazine,\" published in\\n', 'Boston, conducted a campaign for equal educational opportunities which\\n', 'helped to bear fruit in the founding of Vassar College shortly after the\\n', 'Civil War.\\n', '\\n', '=The Desire to Effect Reforms.=--As they came to study their own history\\n', 'and their own part in civilization, women naturally became deeply\\n', 'interested in all the controversies going on around them. The temperance\\n', 'question made a special appeal to them and they organized to demand the\\n', 'right to be heard on it. In 1846 the \"Daughters of Temperance\" formed a\\n', 'secret society favoring prohibition. They dared to criticize the\\n', 'churches for their indifference and were so bold as to ask that\\n', 'drunkenness be made a ground for divorce.\\n', '\\n', 'The slavery issue even more than temperance called women into public\\n', 'life. The Grimke sisters of South Carolina emancipated their bondmen,\\n', 'and one of these sisters, exiled from Charleston for her \"Appeal to the\\n', 'Christian Women of the South,\" went North to work against the slavery\\n', \"system. In 1837 the National Women's Anti-Slavery Convention met in New\\n\", 'York; seventy-one women delegates represented eight states. Three years\\n', 'later eight American women, five of them in Quaker costume, attended the\\n', 'World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, much to the horror of the men,\\n', 'who promptly excluded them from the sessions on the ground that it was\\n', 'not fitting for women to take part in such meetings.\\n', '\\n', 'In other spheres of activity, especially social service, women steadily\\n', 'enlarged their interest. Nothing human did they consider alien to them.\\n', 'They inveighed against cruel criminal laws and unsanitary prisons. They\\n', 'organized poor relief and led in private philanthropy. Dorothea Dix\\n', 'directed the movement that induced the New York legislature to establish\\n', 'in 1845 a separate asylum for the criminal insane. In the same year\\n', 'purpose of reducing the long hours of labor for women, safeguarding \"the\\n', 'constitutions of future generations.\" Mrs. Eliza Woodson Farnham, matron\\n', 'in Sing Sing penitentiary, was known throughout the nation for her\\n', 'social work, especially prison reform. Wherever there were misery and\\n', 'suffering, women were preparing programs of relief.\\n', '\\n', '=Freedom of Speech for Women.=--In the advancement of their causes, of\\n', 'whatever kind, women of necessity had to make public appeals and take\\n', 'part in open meetings. Here they encountered difficulties. The\\n', 'appearance of women on the platform was new and strange. Naturally it\\n', 'was widely resented. Antoinette Brown, although she had credentials as a\\n', 'delegate, was driven off the platform of a temperance convention in New\\n', 'York City simply because she was a woman. James Russell Lowell, editor\\n', 'of the \"Atlantic Monthly,\" declined a poem from Julia Ward Howe on the\\n', 'theory that no woman could write a poem; but he added on second thought\\n', 'that he might consider an article in prose. Nathaniel Hawthorne,\\n', 'another editor, even objected to something in prose because to him \"all\\n', 'ink-stained women were equally detestable.\" To the natural resentment\\n', 'against their intrusion into new fields was added that aroused by their\\n', 'ideas and methods. As temperance reformers, they criticized in a caustic\\n', 'manner those who would not accept their opinions. As opponents of\\n', 'slavery they were especially bitter. One of their conventions, held at\\n', 'Philadelphia in 1833, passed a resolution calling on all women to leave\\n', 'those churches that would not condemn every form of human bondage. This\\n', 'stirred against them many of the clergy who, accustomed to having women\\n', 'sit silent during services, were in no mood to treat such a revolt\\n', 'leniently. Then came the last straw. Women decided that they would\\n', 'preach--out of the pulpit first, and finally in it.\\n', '\\n', '=Women in Industry.=--The period of this ferment was also the age of the\\n', 'industrial revolution in America, the rise of the factory system, and\\n', 'the growth of mill towns. The labor of women was transferred from the\\n', 'homes to the factories. Then arose many questions: the hours of labor,\\n', 'the sanitary conditions of the mills, the pressure of foreign\\n', 'immigration on native labor, the wages of women as compared with those\\n', 'of men, and the right of married women to their own earnings. Labor\\n', 'organizations sprang up among working women. The mill girls of Lowell,\\n', 'Massachusetts, mainly the daughters of New England farmers, published a\\n', 'magazine, \"The Lowell Offering.\" So excellent were their writings that\\n', 'the French statesman, Thiers, carried a copy of their paper into the\\n', 'Chamber of Deputies to show what working women could achieve in a\\n', 'republic. As women were now admittedly earning their own way in the\\n', 'world by their own labor, they began to talk of their \"economic\\n', 'independence.\"\\n', '\\n', \"=The World Shaken by Revolution.=--Such was the quickening of women's\\n\", 'minds in 1848 when the world was startled once more by a revolution in\\n', 'France which spread to Germany, Poland, Austria, Hungary, and Italy.\\n', 'Once more the people of the earth began to explore the principles of\\n', 'democracy and expound human rights. Women, now better educated and more\\n', '\"advanced\" in their ideas, played a role of still greater importance in\\n', 'that revolution. They led in agitations and uprisings. They suffered\\n', 'from reaction and persecution. From their prison in France, two of them\\n', \"who had been jailed for too much insistence on women's rights exchanged\\n\", 'greetings with American women who were raising the same issue here. By\\n', 'this time the women had more supporters among the men. Horace Greeley,\\n', 'editor of the New York _Tribune_, though he afterwards recanted, used\\n', 'his powerful pen in their behalf. Anti-slavery leaders welcomed their\\n', 'aid and repaid them by urging the enfranchisement of women.\\n', '\\n', \"=The Woman's Rights Convention of 1848.=--The forces, moral and\\n\", 'intellectual, which had been stirring among women, crystallized a few\\n', 'months after the outbreak of the European revolution in the first\\n', \"Woman's Rights Convention in the history of America. It met at Seneca\\n\", 'Falls, New York, in 1848, on the call of Lucretia Mott, Martha Wright,\\n', 'Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Mary Ann McClintock, three of them Quakers.\\n', 'Accustomed to take part in church meetings with men, the Quakers\\n', 'naturally suggested that men as well as women be invited to attend the\\n', 'convention. Indeed, a man presided over the conference, for that\\n', 'position seemed too presumptuous even for such stout advocates of\\n', \"woman's rights.\\n\", '\\n', 'The deliberations of the Seneca Falls convention resulted in a\\n', 'Declaration of Rights modeled after the Declaration of Independence. For\\n', 'example, the preamble began: \"When in the course of human events it\\n', 'becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among\\n', 'the people of the earth a position different from that which they have\\n', 'hitherto occupied....\" So also it closed: \"Such has been the patient\\n', 'suffering of women under this government and such is now the necessity\\n', 'which constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are\\n', 'entitled.\" Then followed the list of grievances, the same number which\\n', 'disabilities imposed upon them by the English common law imported into\\n', 'America--the law which denied married women their property, their wages,\\n', 'and their legal existence as separate persons. All these grievances they\\n', 'recited to \"a candid world.\" The remedies for the evils which they\\n', 'endured were then set forth in detail. They demanded \"equal rights\" in\\n', 'the colleges, trades, and professions; equal suffrage; the right to\\n', 'share in all political offices, honors, and emoluments; the right to\\n', 'complete equality in marriage, including equal guardianship of the\\n', 'children; and for married women the right to own property, to keep\\n', 'wages, to make contracts, to transact business, and to testify in the\\n', 'courts of justice. In short, they declared women to be persons as men\\n', 'are persons and entitled to all the rights and privileges of human\\n', 'beings. Such was the clarion call which went forth to the world in\\n', '1848--to an amused and contemptuous world, it must be admitted--but to a\\n', 'world fated to heed and obey.\\n', '\\n', '=The First Gains in Civil Liberty.=--The convention of 1848 did not make\\n', 'political enfranchisement the leading issue. Rather did it emphasize the\\n', 'civil disabilities of women which were most seriously under discussion\\n', 'at the time. Indeed, the New York legislature of that very year, as the\\n', \"result of a twelve years' agitation, passed the Married Woman's Property\\n\", 'Act setting aside the general principles of the English common law as\\n', 'applied to women and giving them many of the \"rights of man.\" California\\n', 'and Wisconsin followed in 1850; Massachusetts in 1854; and Kansas in\\n', \"1859. Other states soon fell into line. Women's earnings and\\n\", 'inheritances were at last their own in some states at least. In a little\\n', 'while laws were passed granting women rights as equal guardians of their\\n', 'children and permitting them to divorce their husbands on the grounds of\\n', 'cruelty and drunkenness.\\n', '\\n', \"By degrees other steps were taken. The Woman's Medical College of\\n\", 'Pennsylvania was founded in 1850, and the Philadelphia School of Design\\n', \"for Women three years later. In 1852 the American Women's Educational\\n\", 'Association was formed to initiate an agitation for enlarged\\n', 'educational opportunities for women. Other colleges soon emulated the\\n', 'example of Oberlin: the University of Utah in 1850; Hillsdale College in\\n', 'Michigan in 1855; Baker University in Kansas in 1858; and the University\\n', 'of Iowa in 1860. New trades and professions were opened to women and old\\n', 'prejudices against their activities and demands slowly gave way.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Beginnings of Organization.=--As women surmounted one obstacle\\n', 'after another, the agitation for equal suffrage came to the front. If\\n', 'any year is to be fixed as the date of its beginning, it may very well\\n', 'be 1850, when the suffragists of Ohio urged the state constitutional\\n', 'convention to confer the vote upon them. With apparent spontaneity there\\n', 'were held in the same year state suffrage conferences in Indiana,\\n', 'Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts; and connections were formed among the\\n', 'leaders of these meetings. At the same time the first national suffrage\\n', 'convention was held in Worcester, Massachusetts, on the call of\\n', 'eighty-nine leading men and women representing six states. Accounts of\\n', 'the convention were widely circulated in this country and abroad.\\n', 'English women,--for instance, Harriet Martineau,--sent words of\\n', 'appreciation for the work thus inaugurated. It inspired a leading\\n', 'article in the \"Westminster Review,\" which deeply interested the\\n', 'distinguished economist, John Stuart Mill. Soon he was the champion of\\n', 'woman suffrage in the British Parliament and the author of a powerful\\n', 'tract _The Subjection of Women_, widely read throughout the\\n', 'English-speaking world. Thus do world movements grow. Strange to relate\\n', 'the women of England were enfranchised before the adoption of the\\n', 'federal suffrage amendment in America.\\n', '\\n', 'The national suffrage convention of 1850 was followed by an\\n', 'extraordinary outburst of agitation. Pamphlets streamed from the press.\\n', 'Petitions to legislative bodies were drafted, signed, and presented.\\n', 'There were addresses by favorite orators like Garrison, Phillips, and\\n', 'Curtis, and lectures and poems by men like Emerson, Longfellow, and\\n', 'Whittier. In 1853 the first suffrage paper was founded by the wife of a\\n', 'member of Congress from Rhode Island. By this time the last barrier to\\n', \"white manhood suffrage in the North had been swept away and the woman's\\n\", 'movement was gaining momentum every year.\\n', '\\n', '=The Suffrage Movement Checked by the Civil War.=--Advocates of woman\\n', 'suffrage believed themselves on the high road to success when the Civil\\n', 'War engaged the energies and labors of the nation. Northern women became\\n', 'absorbed in the struggle to preserve the union. They held no suffrage\\n', 'conventions for five years. They transformed their associations into\\n', 'Loyalty Leagues. They banded together to buy only domestic goods when\\n', 'foreign imports threatened to ruin American markets. They rolled up\\n', 'monster petitions in favor of the emancipation of slaves. In hospitals,\\n', 'in military prisons, in agriculture, and in industry they bore their\\n', 'full share of responsibility. Even when the New York legislature took\\n', 'advantage of their unguarded moments and repealed the law giving the\\n', 'mother equal rights with the father in the guardianship of children,\\n', 'they refused to lay aside war work for agitation. As in all other wars,\\n', 'their devotion was unstinted and their sacrifices equal to the\\n', 'necessities of the hour.\\n', '\\n', '=The Federal Suffrage Amendment.=--Their plans and activities, when the\\n', 'war closed, were shaped by events beyond their control. The emancipation\\n', 'of the slaves and their proposed enfranchisement made prominent the\\n', 'question of a national suffrage for the first time in our history.\\n', 'Friends of the colored man insisted that his civil liberties would not\\n', 'be safe unless he was granted the right to vote. The woman suffragists\\n', 'very pertinently asked why the same principle did not apply to women.\\n', 'The answer which they received was negative. The fourteenth amendment to\\n', 'the federal Constitution, adopted in 1868, definitely put women aside by\\n', 'limiting the scope of its application, so far as the suffrage was\\n', 'concerned, to the male sex. In making manhood suffrage national,\\n', 'however, it nationalized the issue.\\n', '\\n', 'This was the signal for the advocates of woman suffrage. In March, 1869,\\n', 'of Indiana. It provided that no citizen should be deprived of the vote\\n', 'on account of sex, following the language of the fifteenth amendment\\n', 'which forbade disfranchisement on account of race. Support for the\\n', 'amendment, coming from many directions, led the suffragists to believe\\n', 'that their case was hopeful. In their platform of 1872, for example, the\\n', 'Republicans praised the women for their loyal devotion to freedom,\\n', 'welcomed them to spheres of wider usefulness, and declared that the\\n', 'demand of any class of citizens for additional rights deserved\\n', '\"respectful consideration.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Experience soon demonstrated, however, that praise was not the ballot.\\n', 'Indeed the suffragists already had realized that a tedious contest lay\\n', 'before them. They had revived in 1866 their regular national convention.\\n', 'They gave the name of \"The Revolution\" to their paper, edited by\\n', 'suffrage association and organized annual pilgrimages to Congress to\\n', 'present their claims. Such activities bore some results. Many eminent\\n', 'congressmen were converted to their cause and presented it ably to their\\n', 'colleagues of both chambers. Still the subject was ridiculed by the\\n', 'newspapers and looked upon as freakish by the masses.\\n', '\\n', '=The State Campaigns.=--Discouraged by the outcome of the national\\n', 'campaign, suffragists turned to the voters of the individual states and\\n', 'sought the ballot at their hands. Gains by this process were painfully\\n', 'slow. Wyoming, it is true, while still a territory, granted suffrage to\\n', 'women in 1869 and continued it on becoming a state twenty years later,\\n', 'in spite of strong protests in Congress. In 1893 Colorado established\\n', 'complete political equality. In Utah, the third suffrage state, the\\n', 'cause suffered many vicissitudes. Women were enfranchised by the\\n', 'territorial legislature; they were deprived of the ballot by Congress in\\n', '1887; finally in 1896 on the admission of Utah to the union they\\n', 'recovered their former rights. During the same year, 1896, Idaho\\n', 'conferred equal suffrage upon the women. This was the last suffrage\\n', 'victory for more than a decade.\\n', '\\n', '=The Suffrage Cause in Congress.=--In the midst of the meager gains\\n', 'among the states there were occasional flurries of hope for immediate\\n', 'action on the federal amendment. Between 1878 and 1896 the Senate\\n', 'committee reported the suffrage resolution by a favorable majority on\\n', 'five different occasions. During the same period, however, there were\\n', 'nine unfavorable reports and only once did the subject reach the point\\n', 'of a general debate. At no time could anything like the required\\n', 'two-thirds vote be obtained.\\n', '\\n', '=The Changing Status of Women.=--While the suffrage movement was\\n', 'lagging, the activities of women in other directions were steadily\\n', 'multiplying. College after college--Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Smith, Wellesley,\\n', 'to mention a few--was founded to give them the advantages of higher\\n', 'education. Other institutions, especially the state universities of the\\n', 'West, opened their doors to women, and women were received into the\\n', 'professions of law and medicine. By the rapid growth of public high\\n', 'schools in which girls enjoyed the same rights as boys, education was\\n', 'extended still more widely. The number of women teachers increased by\\n', 'leaps and bounds.\\n', '\\n', 'Meanwhile women were entering nearly every branch of industry and\\n', 'business. How many of them worked at gainful occupations before 1870 we\\n', 'do not know; but from that year forward we have the records of the\\n', 'census. Between 1870 and 1900 the proportion of women in the professions\\n', 'rose from less than two per cent to more than ten per cent; in trade and\\n', 'from 13 to 19 per cent. In 1910, there were over 8,000,000 women\\n', 'gainfully employed as compared with 30,000,000 men. When, during the war\\n', 'on Germany, the government established the principle of equal pay for\\n', 'equal work and gave official recognition to the value of their services\\n', 'in industry, it was discovered how far women had traveled along the road\\n', 'forecast by the leaders of 1848.\\n', '\\n', \"=The Club Movement among Women.=--All over the country women's societies\\n\", 'and clubs were started to advance this or that reform or merely to study\\n', \"literature, art, and science. In time these women's organizations of all\\n\", 'kinds were federated into city, state, and national associations and\\n', 'drawn into the consideration of public questions. Under the leadership\\n', 'of Frances Willard they made temperance reform a vital issue. They took\\n', 'an interest in legislation pertaining to prisons, pure food, public\\n', 'health, and municipal government, among other things. At their sessions\\n', 'and conferences local, state, and national issues were discussed until\\n', 'finally, it seems, everything led to the quest of the franchise. By\\n', \"solemn resolution in 1914 the National Federation of Women's Clubs,\\n\", 'representing nearly two million club women, formally endorsed woman\\n', 'suffrage. In the same year the National Education Association, speaking\\n', 'for the public school teachers of the land, added its seal of approval.\\n', '\\n', '=State and National Action.=--Again the suffrage movement was in full\\n', 'swing in the states. Washington in 1910, California in 1911, Oregon,\\n', 'Kansas, and Arizona in 1912, Nevada and Montana in 1914 by popular vote\\n', 'enfranchised their women. Illinois in 1913 conferred upon them the right\\n', 'to vote for President of the United States. The time had arrived for a\\n', 'women in the equal suffrage states to compel one or both of the national\\n', 'political parties to endorse and carry through Congress the federal\\n', 'suffrage amendment. Pressure then came upon Congress from every\\n', 'direction: from the suffragists who made a straight appeal on the\\n', 'grounds of justice; and from the suffragists who besought the women of\\n', 'the West to vote against candidates for President, who would not approve\\n', 'the federal amendment. In 1916, for the first time, a leading\\n', 'Republicans, endorsed the federal amendment and a distinguished\\n', 'ex-President, Roosevelt, exerted a powerful influence to keep it an\\n', 'issue in the campaign.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '1920]\\n', '\\n', '=National Enfranchisement.=--After that, events moved rapidly. The great\\n', 'state of New York adopted equal suffrage in 1917. Oklahoma, South\\n', 'Dakota, and Michigan swung into line the following year; several other\\n', 'states, by legislative action, gave women the right to vote for\\n', 'President. In the meantime the suffrage battle at Washington grew\\n', 'intense. Appeals and petitions poured in upon Congress and the\\n', 'President. Militant suffragists held daily demonstrations in Washington.\\n', 'On September 30, 1918, President Wilson, who, two years before, had\\n', 'opposed federal action and endorsed suffrage by state adoption only,\\n', 'went before Congress and urged the passage of the suffrage amendment to\\n', 'the Constitution. In June, 1919, the requisite two-thirds vote was\\n', 'secured; the resolution was carried and transmitted to the states for\\n', 'ratification. On August 28, 1920, the thirty-sixth state, Tennessee,\\n', 'approved the amendment, making three-fourths of the states as required\\n', 'new political democracy had been created. The age of agitation was\\n', 'closed and the epoch of responsible citizenship opened.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=General References=\\n', '\\n', 'Edith Abbott, _Women in Industry_.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Research Topics=\\n', '\\n', '=The Rise of the Woman Suffrage Movement.=--McMaster, _History of the\\n', '_History of Suffrage in the United States_, pp. 135-145.\\n', '\\n', '=The Development of the Suffrage Movement.=--Porter, pp. 228-254; Ogg,\\n', '_National Progress_ (American Nation Series), pp. 151-156 and p. 382.\\n', '\\n', 'pp. 10-34.\\n', '\\n', '=Women and the Factory System.=--Abbott, pp. 35-62.\\n', '\\n', '=Early Occupations for Women.=--Abbott, pp. 63-85.\\n', '\\n', \"=Women's Wages.=--Abbott, pp. 262-316.\\n\", '\\n', '\\n', '=Questions=\\n', '\\n', '1.

The nation had\\n', 'definitely passed into industrialism. The number of city dwellers\\n', 'employed for wages as contrasted with the farmers working on their own\\n', 'land was steadily mounting. The free land, once the refuge of restless\\n', 'workingmen of the East and the immigrants from Europe, was a thing of\\n', 'the past. As President Roosevelt later said in speaking of the great\\n', 'coal strike, \"a few generations ago, the American workman could have\\n', 'saved money, gone West, and taken up a homestead. Now the free lands\\n', 'were gone. In earlier days, a man who began with a pick and shovel might\\n', 'come to own a mine. That outlet was now closed as regards the immense\\n', 'majority.... The majority of men who earned wages in the coal industry,\\n', 'if they wished to progress at all, were compelled to progress not by\\n', 'ceasing to be wage-earners but by improving the conditions under which\\n', 'all the wage-earners of the country lived and worked.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The disappearance of the free land, President Roosevelt went on to say,\\n', 'also produced \"a crass inequality in the bargaining relation of the\\n', 'employer and the individual employee standing alone. The great\\n', 'coal-mining and coal-carrying companies which employed their tens of\\n', 'thousands could easily dispense with the services of any particular\\n', 'miner. The miner, on the other hand, however expert, could not dispense\\n', 'with the companies. He needed a job; his wife and children would starve\\n', 'if he did not get one.... Individually the miners were impotent when\\n', 'they sought to enter a wage contract with the great companies; they\\n', 'could make fair terms only by uniting into trade unions to bargain\\n', 'collectively.\" It was of this state of affairs that President Taft spoke\\n', 'when he favored the modification of the common law \"so as to put\\n', 'employees of little power and means on a level with their employers in\\n', 'adjusting and agreeing upon their mutual obligations.\"\\n', '\\n', 'recognized the same facts. He said: \"In the early days of the\\n', 'development of industry, the employer and capital investor were\\n', 'frequently one. Daily contact was had between him and his employees, who\\n', 'were his friends and neighbors.... Because of the proportions which\\n', 'modern industry has attained, employers and employees are too often\\n', 'strangers to each other.... Personal relations can be revived only\\n', 'through adequate representation of the employees. Representation is a\\n', 'principle which is fundamentally just and vital to the successful\\n', 'conduct of industry.... It is not consistent for us as Americans to\\n', 'demand democracy in government and practice autocracy in industry....\\n', 'With the developments what they are in industry to-day, there is sure to\\n', 'come a progressive evolution from aristocratic single control, whether\\n', 'by capital, labor, or the state, to democratic, cooperative control by\\n', 'all three.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Company Unions.=--The changed economic life described by the three\\n', 'eminent men just quoted was acknowledged by several great companies and\\n', 'business concerns. All over the country decided efforts were made to\\n', 'bridge the gulf which industry and the corporation had created. Among\\n', 'the devices adopted was that of the \"company union.\" In one of the\\n', 'Western lumber mills, for example, all the employees were invited to\\n', 'join a company organization; they held monthly meetings to discuss\\n', 'matters of common concern; they elected a \"shop committee\" to confer\\n', 'with the representatives of the company; and periodically the agents of\\n', 'the employers attended the conferences of the men to talk over matters\\n', 'of mutual interest. The function of the shop committee was to consider\\n', 'wages, hours, safety rules, sanitation, recreation and other problems.\\n', 'Whenever any employee had a grievance he took it up with the foreman\\n', 'and, if it was not settled to his satisfaction, he brought it before the\\n', 'shop committee. If the members of the shop committee decided in favor of\\n', 'the man with a grievance, they attempted to settle the matter with the\\n', \"company's agents. All these things failing, the dispute was transferred\\n\", \"to a grand meeting of all the employees with the employers'\\n\", 'conference, was broken by calling in impartial arbitrators selected by\\n', 'both sides from among citizens outside the mill. Thus the employees were\\n', 'given a voice in all decisions affecting their work and welfare; rights\\n', 'and grievances were treated as matters of mutual interest rather than\\n', 'individual concern. Representatives of trade unions from outside,\\n', 'however, were rigidly excluded from all negotiations between employers\\n', 'and the employees.\\n', '\\n', '=Profit-sharing.=--Another proposal for drawing capital and labor\\n', 'together was to supplement the wage system by other ties. Sometimes lump\\n', \"sums were paid to employees who remained in a company's service for a\\n\", 'definite period of years. Again they were given a certain percentage of\\n', 'the annual profits. In other instances, employees were allowed to buy\\n', 'stock on easy terms and thus become part owners in the concern. This\\n', 'last plan was carried so far by a large soap manufacturing company that\\n', 'the employees, besides becoming stockholders, secured the right to elect\\n', 'representatives to serve on the board of directors who managed the\\n', 'entire business. So extensive had profit-sharing become by 1914 that the\\n', 'Federal Industrial Relations Committee, appointed by the President,\\n', 'deemed it worthy of a special study. Though opposed by regular trade\\n', 'unions, it was undoubtedly growing in popularity.\\n', '\\n', '=Labor Managers and Welfare Work.=--Another effort of employers to meet\\n', 'the problems of the new age appeared in the appointment of specialists,\\n', 'known as employment managers, whose task it was to study the relations\\n', 'existing between masters and workers and discover practical methods for\\n', 'dealing with each grievance as it arose. By 1918, hundreds of big\\n', 'companies had recognized this modern \"profession\" and universities were\\n', 'giving courses of instruction on the subject to young men and women. In\\n', 'that year a national conference of employment managers was held at\\n', 'Rochester, New York. The discussion revealed a wide range of duties\\n', 'assigned to managers, including questions of wages, hours, sanitation,\\n', 'rest rooms, recreational facilities, and welfare work of every kind\\n', 'designed to make the conditions in mills and factories safer and more\\n', 'humane. Thus it was evident that hundreds of employers had abandoned the\\n', 'old idea that they were dealing merely with individual employees and\\n', 'that their obligations ended with the payment of any wages they saw fit\\n', 'to fix. In short, they were seeking to develop a spirit of cooperation\\n', 'to take the place of competition and enmity; and to increase the\\n', 'production of commodities by promoting the efficiency and happiness of\\n', 'the producers.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The American Federation of Labor.=--Meanwhile a powerful association of\\n', 'workers representing all the leading trades and crafts, organized into\\n', 'unions of their own, had been built up outside the control of employers.\\n', 'This was the American Federation of Labor, a nation-wide union of\\n', 'unions, founded in 1886 on the basis of beginnings made five years\\n', 'before. At the time of its establishment it had approximately 150,000\\n', 'members. Its growth up to the end of the century was slow, for the total\\n', 'enrollment in 1900 was only 300,000. At that point the increase became\\n', 'in 1919. To be counted in the ranks of organized labor were several\\n', 'strong unions, friendly to the Federation, though not affiliated with\\n', 'it. Such, for example, were the Railway Brotherhoods with more than half\\n', 'a million members. By the opening of 1920 the total strength of\\n', 'organized labor was put at about 4,000,000 members, meaning, if we\\n', 'include their families, that nearly one-fifth of the people of the\\n', 'United States were in some positive way dependent upon the operations of\\n', 'trade unions.\\n', '\\n', '=Historical Background.=--This was the culmination of a long and\\n', 'significant history. Before the end of the eighteenth century, the\\n', 'skilled workmen--printers, shoemakers, tailors, and carpenters--had, as\\n', 'we have seen, formed local unions in the large cities. Between 1830 and\\n', '1860, several aggressive steps were taken in the American labor\\n', 'movement. For one thing, the number of local unions increased by leaps\\n', 'and bounds in all the industrial towns. For another, there was\\n', 'established in every large manufacturing city a central labor body\\n', 'composed of delegates from the unions of the separate trades. In the\\n', 'local union the printers or the cordwainers, for example, considered\\n', 'only their special trade problems. In the central labor union, printers,\\n', 'cordwainers, iron molders, and other craftsmen considered common\\n', 'problems and learned to cooperate with one another in enforcing the\\n', 'the same craftsmen in different cities. The printers of New York,\\n', 'Philadelphia, Boston, and other towns, for instance, drew together and\\n', 'formed a national trade union of printers built upon the local unions of\\n', 'that craft. By the eve of the Civil War there were four or five powerful\\n', 'national unions of this character. The expansion of the railway made\\n', 'travel and correspondence easier and national conventions possible even\\n', 'for workmen of small means. About 1834 an attempt was made to federate\\n', 'the unions of all the different crafts into a national organization; but\\n', 'the effort was premature.\\n', '\\n', 'again in the sixties. During the war, industries and railways had\\n', 'flourished as never before; prices had risen rapidly; the demand for\\n', 'labor had increased; wages had mounted slowly, but steadily. Hundreds of\\n', 'new local unions had been founded and eight or ten national trade unions\\n', 'had sprung into being. The time was ripe, it seemed, for a national\\n', \"consolidation of all labor's forces; and in 1866, the year after the\\n\", 'surrender of General Lee at Appomattox, the \"National Labor Union\" was\\n', 'formed at Baltimore under the leadership of an experienced organizer,\\n', \"was not merely to secure labor's standard demands touching hours, wages,\\n\", 'and conditions of work or to maintain the gains already won. It leaned\\n', 'toward political action and radical opinions. Above all, it sought to\\n', 'eliminate the conflict between capital and labor by making workingmen\\n', 'the owners of shops through the formation of cooperative industries. For\\n', 'six years the National Labor Union continued to hold conferences and\\n', 'carry on its propaganda; but most of the cooperative enterprises failed,\\n', 'political dissensions arose, and by 1872 the experiment had come to an\\n', 'end.\\n', '\\n', 'experimenting, there grew up in the industrial world a more radical\\n', 'organization known as the \"Noble Order of the Knights of Labor.\" It was\\n', 'founded in Philadelphia in 1869, first as a secret society with rituals,\\n', 'signs, and pass words; \"so that no spy of the boss can find his way into\\n', 'the lodge room to betray his fellows,\" as the Knights put it. In form\\n', 'the new organization was simple. It sought to bring all laborers,\\n', 'skilled and unskilled, men and women, white and colored, into a mighty\\n', 'body of local and national unions without distinction of trade or craft.\\n', 'By 1885, ten years after the national organization was established, it\\n', 'boasted a membership of over 700,000. In philosophy, the Knights of\\n', 'Labor were socialistic, for they advocated public ownership of the\\n', 'railways and other utilities and the formation of cooperative societies\\n', 'to own and manage stores and factories.\\n', '\\n', 'As the Knights were radical in spirit and their strikes, numerous and\\n', 'prolonged, were often accompanied by violence, the organization alarmed\\n', 'employers and the general public, raising up against itself a vigorous\\n', 'opposition. Weaknesses within, as well as foes from without, started the\\n', 'Knights on the path to dissolution. They waged more strikes than they\\n', 'could carry on successfully; their cooperative experiments failed as\\n', 'those of other labor groups before them had failed; and the rank and\\n', 'file could not be kept in line. The majority of the members wanted\\n', 'immediate gains in wages or the reduction of hours; when their hopes\\n', 'were not realized they drifted away from the order. The troubles were\\n', 'increased by the appearance of the American Federation of Labor, a still\\n', 'mightier organization composed mainly of skilled workers who held\\n', 'strategic positions in industry. When they failed to secure the\\n', 'effective support of the Federation in their efforts to organize the\\n', 'unskilled, the employers closed in upon them; then the Knights declined\\n', 'rapidly in power. By 1890 they were a negligible factor and in a short\\n', 'time they passed into the limbo of dead experiments.\\n', '\\n', '=The Policies of the American Federation.=--Unlike the Knights of Labor,\\n', 'the American Federation of Labor sought, first of all, to be very\\n', 'practical in its objects and methods. It avoided all kinds of\\n', 'socialistic theories and attended strictly to the business of organizing\\n', 'unions for the purpose of increasing wages, shortening hours, and\\n', 'improving working conditions for its members. It did not try to include\\n', 'everybody in one big union but brought together the employees of each\\n', 'particular craft whose interests were clearly the same. To prepare for\\n', 'strikes and periods of unemployment, it raised large funds by imposing\\n', 'heavy dues and created a benefit system to hold men loyally to the\\n', 'union. In order to permit action on a national scale, it gave the\\n', 'superior officers extensive powers over local unions.\\n', '\\n', 'While declaring that employers and employees had much in common, the\\n', 'Federation strongly opposed company unions. Employers, it argued, were\\n', \"affiliated with the National Manufacturers' Association or with similar\\n\", \"employers' organizations; every important industry was now national in\\n\", 'scope; and wages and hours, in view of competition with other shops,\\n', 'could not be determined in a single factory, no matter how amicable\\n', 'might be the relations of the company and its workers in that particular\\n', 'plant. For these reasons, the Federation declared company unions and\\n', 'local shop committees inherently weak; it insisted that hours, wages,\\n', 'and other labor standards should be fixed by general trade agreements\\n', 'applicable to all the plants of a given industry, even if subject to\\n', 'local modifications.\\n', '\\n', 'At the same time, the Federation, far from deliberately antagonizing\\n', 'employers, sought to enlist their cooperation and support. It affiliated\\n', 'with the National Civic Federation, an association of business men,\\n', 'financiers, and professional men, founded in 1900 to promote friendly\\n', 'relations in the industrial world. In brief, the American Federation of\\n', 'Labor accepted the modern industrial system and, by organization within\\n', 'it, endeavored to secure certain definite terms and conditions for trade\\n', 'unionists.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Socialists.=--The trade unionism \"pure and simple,\" espoused by the\\n', 'American Federation of Labor, seemed to involve at first glance nothing\\n', 'but businesslike negotiations with employers. In practice it did not\\n', 'work out that way. The Federation was only six years old when a new\\n', 'organization, appealing directly for the labor vote--namely, the\\n', 'Socialist Labor Party--nominated a candidate for President, launched\\n', 'into a national campaign, and called upon trade unionists to desert the\\n', 'older parties and enter its fold.\\n', '\\n', 'The socialistic idea, introduced into national politics in 1892, had\\n', 'been long in germination. Before the Civil War, a number of reformers,\\n', 'including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Horace Greeley, and Wendell Phillips,\\n', 'deeply moved by the poverty of the great industrial cities, had\\n', 'earnestly sought relief in the establishment of cooperative or\\n', 'communistic colonies. They believed that people should go into the\\n', 'country, secure land and tools, own them in common so that no one could\\n', 'profit from exclusive ownership, and produce by common labor the food\\n', 'and clothing necessary for their support. For a time this movement\\n', 'attracted wide interest, but it had little vitality. Nearly all the\\n', 'colonies failed. Selfishness and indolence usually disrupted the best of\\n', 'them.\\n', '\\n', 'In the course of time this \"Utopian\" idea was abandoned, and another set\\n', 'of socialist doctrines, claiming to be more \"scientific,\" appeared\\n', 'instead. The new school of socialists, adopting the principles of a\\n', 'German writer and agitator, Karl Marx, appealed directly to workingmen.\\n', 'It urged them to unite against the capitalists, to get possession of the\\n', 'machinery of government, and to introduce collective or public ownership\\n', 'of railways, land, mines, mills, and other means of production. The\\n', 'Marxian socialists, therefore, became political. They sought to organize\\n', 'labor and to win elections. Like the other parties they put forward\\n', 'candidates and platforms. The Socialist Labor party in 1892, for\\n', 'example, declared in favor of government ownership of utilities, free\\n', 'school books, woman suffrage, heavy income taxes, and the referendum.\\n', 'the Pullman strike, as its candidate, called for public ownership of all\\n', 'trusts, monopolies, mines, railways; and the chief means of production.\\n', 'In the course of time the vote of the latter organization rose to\\n', 'considerable proportions, reaching almost a million in 1912. It declined\\n', 'four years later and then rose in 1920 to about the same figure.\\n', '\\n', 'In their appeal for votes, the socialists of every type turned first to\\n', 'labor. At the annual conventions of the American Federation of Labor\\n', 'they besought the delegates to endorse socialism. The president of the\\n', 'Federation, Samuel Gompers, on each occasion took the floor against\\n', 'them. He repudiated socialism and the socialists, on both theoretical\\n', 'and practical grounds. He opposed too much public ownership, declaring\\n', 'that the government was as likely as any private employer to oppress\\n', 'labor. The approval of socialism, he maintained, would split the\\n', 'Federation on the rock of politics, weaken it in its fight for higher\\n', 'wages and shorter hours, and prejudice the public against it. At every\\n', 'turn he was able to vanquish the socialists in the Federation, although\\n', 'he could not prevent it from endorsing public ownership of the railways\\n', 'at the convention of 1920.\\n', '\\n', '=The Extreme Radicals.=--Some of the socialists, defeated in their\\n', 'efforts to capture organized labor and seeing that the gains in\\n', 'elections were very meager, broke away from both trade unionism and\\n', 'politics. One faction, the Industrial Workers of the World, founded in\\n', '1905, declared themselves opposed to all capitalists, the wages system,\\n', 'and craft unions. They asserted that the \"working class and the\\n', 'employing class have nothing in common\" and that trade unions only\\n', 'pitted one set of workers against another set. They repudiated all\\n', 'government ownership and the government itself, boldly proclaiming their\\n', 'intention to unite all employees into one big union and seize the\\n', 'railways, mines, and mills of the country. This doctrine, so\\n', 'revolutionary in tone, called down upon the extremists the condemnation\\n', 'of the American Federation of Labor as well as of the general public. At\\n', 'its convention in 1919, the Federation went on record as \"opposed to\\n', 'such a policy.\" It announced its \"firm adherence to American ideals.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Federation and Political Issues.=--The hostility of the Federation\\n', 'to the socialists did not mean, however, that it was indifferent to\\n', 'political issues or political parties. On the contrary, from time to\\n', 'time, at its annual conventions, it endorsed political and social\\n', 'reforms, such as the initiative, referendum, and recall, the abolition\\n', 'of child labor, the exclusion of Oriental labor, old-age pensions, and\\n', 'government ownership. Moreover it adopted the policy of \"rewarding\\n', 'friends and punishing enemies\" by advising members to vote for or\\n', 'against candidates according to their stand on the demands of organized\\n', 'labor.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'This policy was pursued with especial zeal in connection with disputes\\n', 'over the use of injunctions in labor controversies. An injunction is a\\n', 'bill or writ issued by a judge ordering some person or corporation to do\\n', 'or to refrain from doing something. For example, a judge may order a\\n', 'trade union to refrain from interfering with non-union men or to\\n', 'continue at work handling goods made by non-union labor; and he may fine\\n', 'or imprison those who disobey his injunction, the penalty being\\n', 'inflicted for \"contempt of court.\" This ancient legal device came into\\n', 'prominence in connection with nation-wide railway strikes in 1877. It\\n', 'was applied with increasing frequency after its effective use against\\n', '\\n', 'Aroused by the extensive use of the writ, organized labor demanded that\\n', 'the power of judges to issue injunctions in labor disputes be limited by\\n', 'law. Representatives of the unions sought support from the Democrats and\\n', 'the Republicans; they received from the former very specific and cordial\\n', 'endorsement. In 1896 the Democratic platform denounced \"government by\\n', 'injunction as a new and highly dangerous form of oppression.\" Mr.\\n', 'Gompers, while refusing to commit the Federation to Democratic politics,\\n', 'privately supported Mr. Bryan. In 1908, he came out openly and boasted\\n', 'that eighty per cent of the votes of the Federation had been cast for\\n', 'the Democratic candidate. Again in 1912 the same policy was pursued. The\\n', 'reward was the enactment in 1914 of a federal law exempting trade unions\\n', 'from prosecution as combinations in restraint of trade, limiting the use\\n', 'of the injunction in labor disputes, and prescribing trial by jury in\\n', 'case of contempt of court. This measure was hailed by Mr. Gompers as the\\n', '\"Magna Carta of Labor\" and a vindication of his policy. As a matter of\\n', 'fact, however, it did not prevent the continued use of injunctions\\n', 'against trade unions. Nevertheless Mr. Gompers was unshaken in his\\n', 'conviction that organized labor should not attempt to form an\\n', 'independent political party or endorse socialist or other radical\\n', 'economic theories.\\n', '\\n', '=Organized Labor and the Public.=--Besides its relations to employers,\\n', 'radicals within its own ranks, and political questions, the Federation\\n', 'had to face responsibilities to the general public. With the passing of\\n', 'time these became heavy and grave. While industries were small and\\n', 'conflicts were local in character, a strike seldom affected anybody but\\n', 'the employer and the employees immediately involved in it. When,\\n', 'however, industries and trade unions became organized on a national\\n', 'scale and a strike could paralyze a basic enterprise like coal mining or\\n', 'railways, the vital interests of all citizens were put in jeopardy.\\n', 'Moreover, as increases in wages and reductions in hours often added\\n', 'directly to the cost of living, the action of the unions affected the\\n', 'well-being of all--the food, clothing, and shelter of the whole people.\\n', '\\n', 'For the purpose of meeting the issue raised by this state of affairs, it\\n', 'was suggested that employers and employees should lay their disputes\\n', 'before commissions of arbitration for decision and settlement. President\\n', 'Cleveland, in a message of April 2, 1886, proposed such a method for\\n', 'disposing of industrial controversies, and two years later Congress\\n', 'enacted a voluntary arbitration law applicable to the railways. The\\n', 'principle was extended in 1898 and again in 1913, and under the\\n', 'authority of the federal government many contentions in the railway\\n', 'world were settled by arbitration.\\n', '\\n', 'The success of such legislation induced some students of industrial\\n', 'questions to urge that unions and employers should be compelled to\\n', 'submit all disputes to official tribunals of arbitration. Kansas\\n', 'actually passed such a law in 1920. Congress in the Esch-Cummins railway\\n', 'bill of the same year created a federal board of nine members to which\\n', 'all railway controversies, not settled by negotiation, must be\\n', 'submitted. Strikes, however, were not absolutely forbidden. Generally\\n', 'speaking, both employers and employees opposed compulsory adjustments\\n', 'without offering any substitute in case voluntary arbitration should not\\n', 'be accepted by both parties to a dispute.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Problems of Immigration.=--From its very inception, the American\\n', 'Federation of Labor, like the Knights of Labor before it, was confronted\\n', 'by numerous questions raised by the ever swelling tide of aliens coming\\n', 'to our shores. In its effort to make each trade union all-inclusive, it\\n', 'had to wrestle with a score or more languages. When it succeeded in\\n', 'thoroughly organizing a craft, it often found its purposes defeated by\\n', 'an influx of foreigners ready to work for lower wages and thus undermine\\n', 'the foundations of the union.\\n', '\\n', 'At the same time, persons outside the labor movement began to be\\n', 'apprehensive as they contemplated the undoubted evil, as well as the\\n', 'good, that seemed to be associated with the \"alien invasion.\" They saw\\n', 'whole sections of great cities occupied by people speaking foreign\\n', 'tongues, reading only foreign newspapers, and looking to the Old World\\n', 'alone for their ideas and their customs. They witnessed an expanding\\n', 'army of total illiterates, men and women who could read and write no\\n', 'language at all; while among those aliens who could read few there were\\n', 'who knew anything of American history, traditions, and ideals. Official\\n', 'reports revealed that over twenty per cent of the men of the draft army\\n', 'during the World War could not read a newspaper or write a letter home.\\n', 'Perhaps most alarming of all was the discovery that thousands of alien\\n', 'men are in the United States only on a temporary sojourn, solely to make\\n', 'money and return home with their savings. These men, willing to work for\\n', 'low wages and live in places unfit for human beings, have no stake in\\n', 'this country and do not care what becomes of it.\\n', '\\n', '=The Restriction of Immigration.=--In all this there was, strictly\\n', 'speaking, no cause for surprise. Since the foundation of our republic\\n', 'the policy of the government had been to encourage the coming of the\\n', 'alien. For nearly one hundred years no restraining act was passed by\\n', 'Congress, while two important laws positively encouraged it; namely, the\\n', 'homestead act of 1862 and the contract immigration law of 1864. Not\\n', 'until American workingmen came into open collision with cheap Chinese\\n', 'labor on the Pacific Coast did the federal government spread the first\\n', 'measure of limitation on the statute books. After the discovery of gold,\\n', 'and particularly after the opening of the railway construction era, a\\n', 'horde of laborers from China descended upon California. Accustomed to\\n', 'starvation wages and indifferent to the conditions of living, they\\n', 'threatened to cut the American standard to the point of subsistence. By\\n', '1876 the protest of American labor was loud and long and both the\\n', 'Republicans and the Democrats gave heed to it. In 1882 Congress enacted\\n', 'a law prohibiting the admission of Chinese laborers to the United States\\n', 'for a term of ten years--later extended by legislation. In a little\\n', 'while the demand arose for the exclusion of the Japanese as well. In\\n', 'this case no exclusion law was passed; but an understanding was reached\\n', 'by which Japan agreed not to issue passports to her laborers authorizing\\n', 'them to come to the United States. By act of Congress in 1907 the\\n', 'President was empowered to exclude any laborers who, having passports to\\n', 'Canada, Hawaii, or Mexico, attempted to enter our country.\\n', '\\n', 'These laws and agreements, however, did not remove all grounds for the\\n', 'agitation of the subject. They were difficult to enforce and it was\\n', 'claimed by residents of the Coast that in spite of federal authority\\n', 'Oriental laborers were finding their way into American ports. Moreover,\\n', 'several Western states, anxious to preserve the soil for American\\n', 'ownership, enacted laws making it impossible for Chinese and Japanese to\\n', 'buy land outright; and in other ways they discriminated against\\n', 'Orientals. Such proceedings placed the federal government in an\\n', 'embarrassing position. By treaty it had guaranteed specific rights to\\n', 'Japanese citizens in the United States, and the government at Tokyo\\n', 'contended that the state laws just cited violated the terms of the\\n', 'international agreement. The Western states were fixed in their\\n', 'determination to control Oriental residents; Japan was equally\\n', 'persistent in asking that no badge of inferiority be attached to her\\n', 'citizens. Subjected to pressure on both sides, the federal government\\n', 'sought a way out of the deadlock.\\n', '\\n', 'Having embarked upon the policy of restriction in 1882, Congress readily\\n', 'extended it. In that same year it barred paupers, criminals, convicts,\\n', 'and the insane. Three years later, mainly owing to the pressure of the\\n', 'Knights of Labor, it forbade any person, company, or association to\\n', 'import aliens under contract. By an act of 1887, the contract labor\\n', 'restriction was made even more severe. In 1903, anarchists were excluded\\n', 'and the bureau of immigration was transferred from the Treasury\\n', 'Department to the Department of Commerce and Labor, in order to provide\\n', 'for a more rigid execution of the law. In 1907 the classes of persons\\n', 'denied admission were widened to embrace those suffering from physical\\n', 'and mental defects and otherwise unfit for effective citizenship. When\\n', 'the Department of Labor was established in 1913 the enforcement of the\\n', 'was a former leader in the American Federation of Labor.\\n', '\\n', '=The Literacy Test.=--Still the advocates of restriction were not\\n', 'satisfied. Still organized labor protested and demanded more protection\\n', 'against the competition of immigrants. In 1917 it won a thirty-year\\n', 'battle in the passage of a bill excluding \"all aliens over sixteen years\\n', 'of age, physically capable of reading, who cannot read the English\\n', 'language or some other language or dialect, including Hebrew or\\n', 'Yiddish.\" Even President Wilson could not block it, for a two-thirds\\n', 'vote to overcome his veto was mustered in Congress.\\n', '\\n', 'This act, while it served to exclude illiterates, made no drastic cut in\\n', 'the volume of immigration. Indeed a material reduction was resolutely\\n', 'opposed in many quarters. People of certain nationalities already in the\\n', 'United States objected to every barrier that shut out their own kinsmen.\\n', 'Some Americans of the old stock still held to the idea that the United\\n', 'States should continue to be an asylum for \"the oppressed of the earth.\"\\n', 'Many employers looked upon an increased labor supply as the means of\\n', 'escaping what they called \"the domination of trade unions.\" In the babel\\n', 'of countless voices, the discussion of these vital matters went on in\\n', 'town and country.\\n', '\\n', '=Americanization.=--Intimately connected with the subject of immigration\\n', 'was a call for the \"Americanization\" of the alien already within our\\n', 'gates. The revelation of the illiteracy in the army raised the cry and\\n', 'the demand was intensified when it was found that many of the leaders\\n', 'among the extreme radicals were foreign in birth and citizenship.\\n', 'Innumerable programs for assimilating the alien to American life were\\n', 'drawn up, and in 1919 a national conference on the subject was held in\\n', 'Washington under the auspices of the Department of the Interior. All\\n', 'were agreed that the foreigner should be taught to speak and write the\\n', 'language and understand the government of our country. Congress was\\n', 'urged to lend aid in this vast undertaking. America, as ex-President\\n', 'Roosevelt had said, was to find out \"whether it was a nation or a\\n', 'boarding-house.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=General References=\\n', '\\n', 'vols.).\\n', '\\n', 'Samuel Gompers, _Labor and the Common Welfare_.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Research Topics=\\n', '\\n', '=The Rise of Trade Unionism.=--Mary Beard, _Short History of the\\n', 'American Labor Movement_, pp. 10-18, 47-53, 62-79; Carlton, _Organized\\n', 'Labor in American History_, pp. 11-44.\\n', '\\n', '103-112; Carlton, pp. 169-197; Ogg, _National Progress_ (American Nation\\n', 'Series), pp. 76-85.\\n', '\\n', '=The Knights of Labor.=--Beard, _Short History_, pp. 116-126; Dewey,\\n', '_National Problems_ (American Nation Series), pp. 40-49.\\n', '\\n', '=The American Federation of Labor--Organization and Policies.=--Beard,\\n', '_Short History_, pp. 86-112.\\n', '\\n', '=Organized Labor and the Socialists.=--Beard, _Short History_, pp.\\n', '126-149.\\n', '\\n', '=Labor and the Great War.=--Carlton, pp. 282-306; Beard, _Short\\n', 'History_, pp. 150-170.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Questions=\\n', '\\n', '1.

Outline the history of restrictions on immigration.\\n', '\\n', '14. What problems arise in connection with the assimilation of the alien\\n', 'to American life?\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\"The welfare, the happiness, the energy, and the spirit of the men and\\n', 'women who do the daily work in our mines and factories, on our\\n', 'railroads, in our offices and ports of trade, on our farms, and on the\\n', 'sea are the underlying necessity of all prosperity.\" Thus spoke Woodrow\\n', 'Wilson during his campaign for election. In this spirit, as President,\\n', 'he gave the signal for work by summoning Congress in a special session\\n', 'on April 7, 1913. He invited the cooperation of all \"forward-looking\\n', 'men\" and indicated that he would assume the role of leadership. As an\\n', 'evidence of his resolve, he appeared before Congress in person to read\\n', 'his first message, reviving the old custom of Washington and Adams. Then\\n', 'he let it be known that he would not give his party any rest until it\\n', 'fulfilled its pledges to the country. When Democratic Senators balked at\\n', 'tariff reductions, they were sharply informed that the party had\\n', 'plighted its word and that no excuses or delays would be tolerated.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Financial Measures.=--Under this spirited leadership Congress went to\\n', 'work, passing first the Underwood tariff act of 1913, which made a\\n', 'downward revision in the rates of duty, fixing them on the average about\\n', 'twenty-six per cent lower than the figures of 1907. The protective\\n', 'principle was retained, but an effort was made to permit a moderate\\n', 'element of foreign competition. As a part of the revenue act Congress\\n', 'levied a tax on incomes as authorized by the sixteenth amendment to the\\n', 'Constitution. The tax which roused such party passions twenty years\\n', 'before was now accepted as a matter of course.\\n', '\\n', 'Having disposed of the tariff, Congress took up the old and vexatious\\n', 'currency question and offered a new solution in the form of the federal\\n', 'reserve law of December, 1913. This measure, one of the most interesting\\n', 'in the history of federal finance, embraced four leading features. In\\n', 'the first place, it continued the prohibition on the issuance of notes\\n', 'by state banks and provided for a national currency. In the second\\n', 'place, it put the new banking system under the control of a federal\\n', 'reserve board composed entirely of government officials. To prevent the\\n', 'growth of a \"central money power,\" it provided, in the third place, for\\n', 'the creation of twelve federal reserve banks, one in each of twelve\\n', 'great districts into which the country is divided. All local national\\n', 'banks were required and certain other banks permitted to become members\\n', 'of the new system and share in its control. Finally, with a view to\\n', 'expanding the currency, a step which the Democrats had long urged upon\\n', 'the country, the issuance of paper money, under definite safeguards, was\\n', 'authorized.\\n', '\\n', 'Mindful of the agricultural interest, ever dear to the heart of\\n', \"Jefferson's followers, the Democrats supplemented the reserve law by the\\n\", 'Farm Loan Act of 1916, creating federal agencies to lend money on farm\\n', 'mortgages at moderate rates of interest. Within a year $20,000,000 had\\n', 'been lent to farmers, the heaviest borrowing being in nine Western and\\n', 'Southern states, with Texas in the lead.\\n', '\\n', '=Anti-trust Legislation.=--The tariff and currency laws were followed by\\n', 'three significant measures relative to trusts. Rejecting utterly the\\n', 'Progressive doctrine of government regulation, President Wilson\\n', 'announced that it was the purpose of the Democrats \"to destroy monopoly\\n', 'and maintain competition as the only effective instrument of business\\n', 'liberty.\" The first step in this direction, the Clayton Anti-trust Act,\\n', 'carried into great detail the Sherman law of 1890 forbidding and\\n', 'penalizing combinations in restraint of interstate and foreign trade. In\\n', 'every line it revealed a determined effort to tear apart the great\\n', 'trusts and to put all business on a competitive basis. Its terms were\\n', 'reinforced in the same year by a law creating a Federal Trade Commission\\n', 'empowered to inquire into the methods of corporations and lodge\\n', 'complaints against concerns \"using any unfair method of competition.\" In\\n', 'only one respect was the severity of the Democratic policy relaxed. An\\n', 'act of 1918 provided that the Sherman law should not apply to companies\\n', 'engaged in export trade, the purpose being to encourage large\\n', 'corporations to enter foreign commerce.\\n', '\\n', 'The effect of this whole body of anti-trust legislation, in spite of\\n', 'much labor on it, remained problematical. Very few combinations were\\n', 'dissolved as a result of it. Startling investigations were made into\\n', 'alleged abuses on the part of trusts; but it could hardly be said that\\n', 'huge business concerns had lost any of their predominance in American\\n', 'industry.\\n', '\\n', '=Labor Legislation.=--By no mere coincidence, the Clayton Anti-trust law\\n', 'of 1914 made many concessions to organized labor. It declared that \"the\\n', 'labor of a human being is not a commodity or an article of commerce,\"\\n', 'and it exempted unions from prosecution as \"combinations in restraint of\\n', 'trade.\" It likewise defined and limited the uses which the federal\\n', 'courts might make of injunctions in labor disputes and guaranteed trial\\n', 'by jury to those guilty of disobedience (see p. 581).\\n', '\\n', \"The Clayton law was followed the next year by the Seamen's Act giving\\n\", 'greater liberty of contract to American sailors and requiring an\\n', 'improvement of living conditions on shipboard. This was such a drastic\\n', 'law that shipowners declared themselves unable to meet foreign\\n', 'competition under its terms, owing to the low labor standards of other\\n', 'countries.\\n', '\\n', \"Still more extraordinary than the Seamen's Act was the Adamson law of\\n\", '1916 fixing a standard eight-hour work-day for trainmen on railroads--a\\n', 'measure wrung from Congress under a threat of a great strike by the four\\n', 'Railway Brotherhoods. This act, viewed by union leaders as a triumph,\\n', 'called forth a bitter denunciation of \"trade union domination,\" but it\\n', 'was easier to criticize than to find another solution of the problem.\\n', '\\n', \"Three other laws enacted during President Wilson's administration were\\n\", 'popular in the labor world. One of them provided compensation for\\n', 'federal employees injured in the discharge of their duties. Another\\n', 'prohibited the labor of children under a certain age in the industries\\n', 'eight-hour day and modern safeguards for life and health. There were\\n', 'positive proofs that organized labor had obtained a large share of power\\n', 'in the councils of the country.\\n', '\\n', '=Federal and State Relations.=--If the interference of the government\\n', 'with business and labor represented a departure from the old idea of\\n', '\"the less government the better,\" what can be said of a large body of\\n', 'laws affecting the rights of states? The prohibition of child labor\\n', 'everywhere was one indication of the new tendency. Mr. Wilson had once\\n', 'declared such legislation unconstitutional; the Supreme Court declared\\n', 'it unconstitutional; but Congress, undaunted, carried it into effect\\n', 'under the guise of a tax on goods made by children below the age limit.\\n', 'There were other indications of the drift. Large sums of money were\\n', 'appropriated by Congress in 1916 to assist the states in building and\\n', 'maintaining highways. The same year the Farm Loan Act projected the\\n', 'federal government into the sphere of local money lending. In 1917\\n', 'millions of dollars were granted to states in aid of vocational\\n', 'education, incidentally imposing uniform standards throughout the\\n', 'country. Evidently the government was no longer limited to the duties of\\n', 'the policeman.\\n', '\\n', 'intervention in state affairs was the passage, in December, 1917, of an\\n', 'amendment to the federal Constitution establishing national prohibition\\n', 'of the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors as beverages. This\\n', 'was the climax of a historical movement extending over half a century.\\n', 'In 1872, a National Prohibition party, launched three years before,\\n', 'nominated its first presidential candidate and inaugurated a campaign of\\n', 'agitation. Though its vote was never large, the cause for which it\\n', 'stood found increasing favor among the people. State after state by\\n', 'popular referendum abolished the liquor traffic within its borders. By\\n', '1917 at least thirty-two of the forty-eight were \"dry.\" When the federal\\n', 'amendment was submitted for approval, the ratification was surprisingly\\n', 'swift. In a little more than a year, namely, on January 16, 1919, it was\\n', 'proclaimed. Twelve months later the amendment went into effect.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Philippines and Porto Rico.=--Independence for the Philippines and\\n', 'larger self-government for Porto Rico had been among the policies of the\\n', 'Democratic party since the campaign of 1900. President Wilson in his\\n', 'annual messages urged upon Congress more autonomy for the Filipinos and\\n', 'a definite promise of final independence. The result was the Jones\\n', 'Organic Act for the Philippines passed in 1916. This measure provided\\n', 'that the upper as well as the lower house of the Philippine legislature\\n', 'should be elected by popular vote, and declared it to be the intention\\n', 'of the United States to grant independence \"as soon as a stable\\n', 'government can be established.\" This, said President Wilson on signing\\n', 'the bill, is \"a very satisfactory advance in our policy of extending to\\n', 'them self-government and control of their own affairs.\" The following\\n', \"year Congress, yielding to President Wilson's insistence, passed a new\\n\", '\\n', 'organic act for Porto Rico, making both houses of the legislature\\n', 'elective and conferring American citizenship upon the inhabitants of the\\n', 'island.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=American Power in the Caribbean.=--While extending more self-government\\n', 'to its dominions, the United States enlarged its sphere of influence in\\n', 'the Caribbean. The supervision of finances in Santo Domingo, inaugurated\\n', \"in Roosevelt's administration, was transformed into a protectorate under\\n\", 'Wilson. In 1914 dissensions in the republic led to the landing of\\n', 'American marines to \"supervise\" the elections. Two years later, an\\n', 'officer in the American navy, with authority from Washington, placed\\n', 'the entire republic \"in a state of military occupation.\" He proceeded to\\n', 'suspend the government and laws of the country, exile the president,\\n', 'suppress the congress, and substitute American military authority. In\\n', '1919 a consulting board of four prominent Dominicans was appointed to\\n', 'aid the American military governor; but it resigned the next year after\\n', 'making a plea for the restoration of independence to the republic. For\\n', 'all practical purposes, it seemed, the sovereignty of Santo Domingo had\\n', 'been transferred to the United States.\\n', '\\n', 'In the neighboring republic of Haiti, a similar state of affairs\\n', 'existed. In the summer of 1915 a revolution broke out there--one of a\\n', 'long series beginning in 1804--and our marines were landed to restore\\n', 'order. Elections were held under the supervision of American officers,\\n', 'and a treaty was drawn up placing the management of Haitian finances and\\n', 'the local constabulary under American authority. In taking this action,\\n', 'our Secretary of State was careful to announce: \"The United States\\n', 'government has no purpose of aggression and is entirely disinterested in\\n', 'promoting this protectorate.\" Still it must be said that there were\\n', 'vigorous protests on the part of natives and American citizens against\\n', 'the conduct of our agents in the island. In 1921 President Wilson was\\n', 'considering withdrawal.\\n', '\\n', 'In line with American policy in the West Indian waters was the purchase\\n', 'in 1917 of the Danish Islands just off the coast of Porto Rico. The\\n', 'strategic position of the islands, especially in relation to Haiti and\\n', 'Porto Rico, made them an object of American concern as early as 1867,\\n', 'when a treaty of purchase was negotiated only to be rejected by the\\n', 'Senate of the United States. In 1902 a second arrangement was made, but\\n', 'this time it was defeated by the upper house of the Danish parliament.\\n', 'The third treaty brought an end to fifty years of bargaining and the\\n', 'Stars and Stripes were raised over St. Croix, St. Thomas, St. John, and\\n', 'numerous minor islands scattered about in the neighborhood. \"It would be\\n', 'suicidal,\" commented a New York newspaper, \"for America, on the\\n', 'threshold of a great commercial expansion in South America, to suffer a\\n', 'Heligoland, or a Gibraltar, or an Aden to be erected by her rivals at\\n', 'the mouth of her Suez.\" On the mainland American power was strengthened\\n', 'by the establishment of a protectorate over Nicaragua in 1916.\\n', '\\n', '=Mexican Relations.=--The extension of American enterprise southward\\n', 'into Latin America, of which the operations in the Caribbean regions\\n', 'were merely one phase, naturally carried Americans into Mexico to\\n', 'develop the natural resources of that country. Under the iron rule of\\n', 'General Porfirio Diaz, established in 1876 and maintained with only a\\n', 'short break until 1911, Mexico had become increasingly attractive to our\\n', 'business men. On the invitation of President Diaz, they had invested\\n', 'huge sums in Mexican lands, oil fields, and mines, and had laid the\\n', 'foundations of a new industrial order. The severe regime instituted by\\n', 'Diaz, however, stirred popular discontent. The peons, or serfs, demanded\\n', 'the break-up of the great estates, some of which had come down from the\\n', 'days of Cortez. Their clamor for \"the restoration of the land to the\\n', 'people could not be silenced.\" In 1911 Diaz was forced to resign and\\n', 'left the country.\\n', '\\n', 'Mexico now slid down the path to disorder. Revolutions and civil\\n', 'installed as the successor to Diaz, was deposed in 1913 and brutally\\n', 'murdered. Huerta, a military adventurer, hailed for a time as another\\n', '\"strong man,\" succeeded Madero whose murder he was accused of\\n', 'instigating. Although Great Britain and nearly all the powers of Europe\\n', 'accepted the new government as lawful, the United States steadily\\n', 'withheld recognition. In the meantime Mexico was torn by insurrections\\n', 'under the leadership of Carranza, a friend of Madero, Villa, a bandit of\\n', 'generous pretensions, and Zapata, a radical leader of the peons. Without\\n', 'the support of the United States, Huerta was doomed.\\n', '\\n', 'In the summer of 1914, the dictator resigned and fled from the capital,\\n', 'leaving the field to Carranza. For six years the new president,\\n', 'recognized by the United States, held a precarious position which he\\n', 'vigorously strove to strengthen against various revolutionary movements.\\n', 'At length in 1920, he too was deposed and murdered, and another military\\n', 'chieftain, Obregon, installed in power.\\n', '\\n', 'These events right at our door could not fail to involve the government\\n', 'of the United States. In the disorders many American citizens lost their\\n', 'lives. American property was destroyed and land owned by Americans was\\n', 'natural resources of the country, struck at the rights of foreign\\n', 'investors. Moreover the Mexican border was in constant turmoil. Even in\\n', 'the last days of his administration, Mr. Taft felt compelled to issue a\\n', 'solemn warning to the Mexican government protesting against the\\n', 'violation of American rights.\\n', '\\n', 'President Wilson, soon after his inauguration, sent a commissioner to\\n', 'Mexico to inquire into the situation. Although he declared a general\\n', 'policy of \"watchful waiting,\" he twice came to blows with Mexican\\n', 'forces. In 1914 some American sailors at Tampico were arrested by a\\n', 'Mexican officer; the Mexican government, although it immediately\\n', 'released the men, refused to make the required apology for the incident.\\n', 'As a result President Wilson ordered the landing of American forces at\\n', 'which several Americans were killed. War seemed inevitable, but at this\\n', 'juncture the governments of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile tendered their\\n', 'good offices as mediators. After a few weeks of negotiation, during\\n', 'which Huerta was forced out of power, American forces were withdrawn\\n', 'from Vera Cruz and the incident closed.\\n', '\\n', 'In 1916 a second break in amicable relations occurred. In the spring of\\n', \"that year a band of Villa's men raided the town of Columbus, New Mexico,\\n\", 'under the command of General Pershing was quickly sent out to capture\\n', 'the offenders. Against the protests of President Carranza, American\\n', 'forces penetrated deeply into Mexico without effecting the object of\\n', 'the undertaking. This operation lasted until January, 1917, when the\\n', 'imminence of war with Germany led to the withdrawal of the American\\n', 'soldiers. Friendly relations were resumed with the Mexican government\\n', 'and the policy of \"watchful waiting\" was continued.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Outbreak of the War.=--In the opening days of August, 1914, the\\n', 'age-long jealousies of European nations, sharpened by new imperial\\n', 'ambitions, broke out in another general conflict such as had shaken the\\n', 'world in the days of Napoleon. On June 28, the heir to the\\n', 'Austro-Hungarian throne was assassinated at Serajevo, the capital of\\n', 'Bosnia, an Austrian province occupied mainly by Serbs. With a view to\\n', 'stopping Serbian agitation for independence, Austria-Hungary laid the\\n', 'blame for this incident on the government of Serbia and made humiliating\\n', 'demands on that country. Germany at once proposed that the issue should\\n', 'be regarded as \"an affair which should be settled solely between\\n', 'Austria-Hungary and Serbia\"; meaning that the small nation should be\\n', 'left to the tender mercies of a great power. Russia refused to take this\\n', 'view. Great Britain proposed a settlement by mediation. Germany backed\\n', 'up Austria to the limit. To use the language of the German authorities:\\n', '\"We were perfectly aware that a possible warlike attitude of\\n', 'Austria-Hungary against Serbia might bring Russia upon the field and\\n', 'that it might therefore involve us in a war, in accordance with our\\n', 'duties as allies. We could not, however, in these vital interests of\\n', 'Austria-Hungary which were at stake, advise our ally to take a yielding\\n', 'attitude not compatible with his dignity nor deny him our assistance.\"\\n', 'That made the war inevitable.\\n', '\\n', 'Every day of the fateful August, 1914, was crowded with momentous\\n', 'events. On the 1st, Germany declared war on Russia. On the 2d, the\\n', 'Germans invaded the little duchy of Luxemburg and notified the King of\\n', 'Belgium that they were preparing to violate the neutrality of his realm\\n', 'on their way to Paris. On the same day, Great Britain, anxiously\\n', 'besought by the French government, promised the aid of the British navy\\n', 'if German warships made hostile demonstrations in the Channel. August\\n', '3d, the German government declared war on France. The following day,\\n', 'Great Britain demanded of Germany respect for Belgian neutrality and,\\n', 'failing to receive the guarantee, broke off diplomatic relations. On the\\n', '5th, the British prime minister announced that war had opened between\\n', 'England and Germany. The storm now broke in all its pitiless fury.\\n', '\\n', '=The State of American Opinion.=--Although President Wilson promptly\\n', 'proclaimed the neutrality of the United States, the sympathies of a\\n', 'large majority of the American people were without doubt on the side of\\n', 'Great Britain and France. To them the invasion of the little kingdom of\\n', 'Belgium and the horrors that accompanied German occupation were odious\\n', 'in the extreme. Moreover, they regarded the German imperial government\\n', 'as an autocratic power wielded in the interest of an ambitious military\\n', 'royal arrogance. On the other hand, many Americans of German descent, in\\n', 'memory of their ties with the Fatherland, openly sympathized with the\\n', 'Central Powers; and many Americans of Irish descent, recalling their\\n', 'long and bitter struggle for home rule in Ireland, would have regarded\\n', 'British defeat as a merited redress of ancient grievances.\\n', '\\n', 'Extremely sensitive to American opinion, but ill informed about it, the\\n', 'German government soon began systematic efforts to present its cause to\\n', 'the people of the United States in the most favorable light possible.\\n', 'Dr. Bernhard Dernburg, the former colonial secretary of the German\\n', 'empire, was sent to America as a special agent. For months he filled the\\n', 'newspapers, magazines, and periodicals with interviews, articles, and\\n', 'notes on the justice of the Teutonic cause. From a press bureau in New\\n', '\"The Fatherland,\" was founded to secure \"fair play for Germany and\\n', 'Austria.\" Several professors in American universities, who had received\\n', 'their training in Germany, took up the pen in defense of the Central\\n', 'Empires. The German language press, without exception it seems, the\\n', 'National German Alliance, minor German societies, and Lutheran churches\\n', 'came to the support of the German cause. Even the English language\\n', 'papers, though generally favorable to the Entente Allies, opened their\\n', 'columns in the interest of equal justice to the spokesmen for all the\\n', 'contending powers of Europe.\\n', '\\n', 'Before two weeks had elapsed the controversy had become so intense that\\n', 'President Wilson (August 18, 1914) was moved to caution his countrymen\\n', 'against falling into angry disputes. \"Every man,\" he said, \"who really\\n', 'loves America will act and speak in the true spirit of neutrality which\\n', 'is the spirit of impartiality and fairness and friendliness to all\\n', 'concerned.... We must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must\\n', 'put a curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that\\n', 'might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before\\n', 'another.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Clash over American Trade.=--As in the time of the Napoleonic wars,\\n', 'the conflict in Europe raised fundamental questions respecting rights of\\n', 'Americans trading with countries at peace as well as those at war. On\\n', 'this point there existed on August 1, 1914, a fairly definite body of\\n', 'principles by which nations were bound. Among them the following were of\\n', 'vital significance. In the first place, it was recognized that an enemy\\n', 'merchant ship caught on the high seas was a legitimate prize of war\\n', 'which might be seized and confiscated. In the second place, it was\\n', 'agreed that \"contraband of war\" found on an enemy or neutral ship was a\\n', 'lawful prize; any ship suspected of carrying it was liable to search and\\n', 'if caught with forbidden goods was subject to seizure. In the third\\n', 'place, international law prescribed that a peaceful merchant ship,\\n', 'whether belonging to an enemy or to a neutral country, should not be\\n', 'destroyed or sunk without provision for the safety of crew and\\n', 'passengers. In the fourth place, it was understood that a belligerent\\n', 'had the right, if it could, to blockade the ports of an enemy and\\n', 'prevent the ingress and egress of all ships; but such a blockade, to be\\n', 'lawful, had to be effective.\\n', '\\n', 'These general principles left undetermined two important matters: \"What\\n', 'is an effective blockade?\" and \"What is contraband of war?\" The task of\\n', 'answering these questions fell to Great Britain as mistress of the seas.\\n', 'Although the German submarines made it impossible for her battleships to\\n', 'maintain a continuous patrol of the waters in front of blockaded ports,\\n', '\\n', 'she declared the blockade to be none the less \"effective\" because her\\n', 'navy was supreme. As to contraband of war Great Britain put such a broad\\n', 'interpretation upon the term as to include nearly every important\\n', 'article of commerce. Early in 1915 she declared even cargoes of grain\\n', 'and flour to be contraband, defending the action on the ground that the\\n', 'German government had recently taken possession of all domestic stocks\\n', 'of corn, wheat, and flour.\\n', '\\n', 'countries surrounding Germany. Great Britain early began to intercept\\n', 'ships carrying oil, gasoline, and copper--all war materials of prime\\n', 'importance--on the ground that they either were destined ultimately to\\n', 'Germany or would release goods for sale to Germans. On November 2, 1914,\\n', 'the English government announced that the Germans wore sowing mines in\\n', 'open waters and that therefore the whole of the North Sea was a military\\n', 'zone. Ships bound for Denmark, Norway, and Sweden were ordered to come\\n', 'by the English Channel for inspection and sailing directions. In effect,\\n', 'Americans were now licensed by Great Britain to trade in certain\\n', 'commodities and in certain amounts with neutral countries.\\n', '\\n', 'Against these extraordinary measures, the State Department at Washington\\n', 'lodged pointed objections, saying: \"This government is reluctantly\\n', \"forced to the conclusion that the present policy of His Majesty's\\n\", 'government toward neutral ships and cargoes exceeds the manifest\\n', 'necessity of a belligerent and constitutes restrictions upon the rights\\n', 'of American citizens on the high seas, which are not justified by the\\n', 'rules of international law or required under the principle of\\n', 'self-preservation.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Germany Begins the Submarine Campaign.=--Germany now announced that, on\\n', 'and after February 18, 1915, the whole of the English Channel and the\\n', 'waters around Great Britain would be deemed a war zone and that every\\n', 'enemy ship found therein would be destroyed. The German decree added\\n', 'that, as the British admiralty had ordered the use of neutral flags by\\n', 'English ships in time of distress, neutral vessels would be in danger of\\n', 'destruction if found in the forbidden area. It was clear that Germany\\n', 'introduced into naval warfare, one not provided for in the accepted laws\\n', 'crew and passengers on board for safe keeping as prescribed by\\n', 'international law; but a submarine ordinarily could do nothing of the\\n', 'sort. Of necessity the lives and the ships of neutrals, as well as of\\n', 'belligerents, were put in mortal peril. This amazing conduct Germany\\n', 'justified on the ground that it was mere retaliation against Great\\n', 'Britain for her violations of international law.\\n', '\\n', 'The response of the United States to the ominous German order was swift\\n', 'and direct. On February 10, 1915, it warned Germany that if her\\n', 'commanders destroyed American lives and ships in obedience to that\\n', 'decree, the action would \"be very hard indeed to reconcile with the\\n', 'friendly relations happily subsisting between the two governments.\" The\\n', 'American note added that the German imperial government would be held to\\n', '\"strict accountability\" and all necessary steps would be taken to\\n', 'safeguard American lives and American rights. This was firm and clear\\n', 'language, but the only response which it evoked from Germany was a\\n', 'suggestion that, if Great Britain would allow food supplies to pass\\n', 'through the blockade, the submarine campaign would be dropped.\\n', '\\n', '=Violations of American Rights.=--Meanwhile Germany continued to ravage\\n', 'shipping on the high seas. On January 28, a German raider sank the\\n', 'British ship, the _Falaba_, was sunk by a submarine and many on board,\\n', 'including an American citizen, were killed; and on April 28, a German\\n', 'airplane dropped bombs on the American steamer _Cushing_. On the morning\\n', 'of May 1, 1915, Americans were astounded to see in the newspapers an\\n', 'advertisement, signed by the German Imperial Embassy, warning travelers\\n', 'of the dangers in the war zone and notifying them that any who ventured\\n', 'on British ships into that area did so at their own risk. On that day,\\n', 'the _Lusitania_, a British steamer, sailed from New York for Liverpool.\\n', 'On May 7, without warning, the ship was struck by two torpedoes and in a\\n', 'few minutes went down by the bow, carrying to death 1153 persons\\n', 'through the country. The German papers in America and a few American\\n', 'people argued that American citizens had been duly warned of the danger\\n', 'and had deliberately taken their lives into their own hands; but the\\n', 'terrible deed was almost universally condemned by public opinion.\\n', '\\n', '=The _Lusitania_ Notes.=--On May 14, the Department of State at\\n', 'Washington made public the first of three famous notes on the\\n', '_Lusitania_ case. It solemnly informed the German government that \"no\\n', 'warning that an unlawful and inhumane act will be committed can possibly\\n', 'be accepted as an excuse or palliation for that act or as an abatement\\n', 'of the responsibility for its commission.\" It called upon the German\\n', 'government to disavow the act, make reparation as far as possible, and\\n', 'take steps to prevent \"the recurrence of anything so obviously\\n', 'subversive of the principles of warfare.\" The note closed with a clear\\n', 'caution to Germany that the government of the United States would not\\n', '\"omit any word or any act necessary to the performance of its sacred\\n', 'duty of maintaining the rights of the United States and its citizens and\\n', 'of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.\" The die was cast;\\n', 'but Germany in reply merely temporized.\\n', '\\n', 'In a second note, made public on June 11, the position of the United\\n', 'States was again affirmed. William Jennings Bryan, the Secretary of\\n', \"State, had resigned because the drift of President Wilson's policy was\\n\", 'not toward mediation but the strict maintenance of American rights, if\\n', 'need be, by force of arms. The German reply was still evasive and German\\n', 'naval commanders continued their course of sinking merchant ships. In a\\n', 'third and final note of July 21, 1915, President Wilson made it clear to\\n', 'Germany that he meant what he said when he wrote that he would maintain\\n', 'the rights of American citizens. Finally after much discussion and\\n', 'shifting about, the German ambassador on September 1, 1915, sent a brief\\n', 'note to the Secretary of State: \"Liners will not be sunk by our\\n', 'submarines without warning and without safety of the lives of\\n', 'non-combatants, provided the liners do not try to escape or offer\\n', 'resistance.\" Editorially, the New York _Times_ declared: \"It is a\\n', 'triumph not only of diplomacy but of reason, of humanity, of justice,\\n', 'and of truth.\" The Secretary of State saw in it \"a recognition of the\\n', 'fundamental principles for which we have contended.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The Presidential Election of 1916.=--In the midst of this crisis came\\n', 'the presidential campaign. On the Republican side everything seemed to\\n', 'depend upon the action of the Progressives. If the breach created in\\n', '1912 could be closed, victory was possible; if not, defeat was certain.\\n', 'Republicans and Progressives were held simultaneously in Chicago. The\\n', 'friends of Roosevelt hoped that both parties would select him as their\\n', 'candidate; but this hope was not realized. The Republicans chose, and\\n', 'the federal Supreme Court who, as governor of New York, had won a\\n', 'national reputation by waging war on \"machine politicians.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In the face of the clamor for expressions of sympathy with one or the\\n', 'other of the contending powers of Europe, the Republicans chose a middle\\n', 'course, declaring that they would uphold all American rights \"at home\\n', 'and abroad, by land and by sea.\" This sentiment Mr. Hughes echoed in his\\n', 'acceptance speech. By some it was interpreted to mean a firmer policy in\\n', 'dealing with Great Britain; by others, a more vigorous handling of the\\n', 'submarine menace. The Democrats, on their side, renominated President\\n', 'Wilson by acclamation, reviewed with pride the legislative achievements\\n', 'of the party, and commended \"the splendid diplomatic victories of our\\n', 'great President who has preserved the vital interests of our government\\n', 'and its citizens and kept us out of war.\"\\n', '\\n', \"In the election which ensued President Wilson's popular vote exceeded\\n\", 'that cast for Mr. Hughes by more than half a million, while his\\n', 'electoral vote stood 277 to 254. The result was regarded, and not\\n', 'without warrant, as a great personal triumph for the President. He had\\n', 'received the largest vote yet cast for a presidential candidate. The\\n', 'Progressive party practically disappeared, and the Socialists suffered a\\n', 'severe set-back, falling far behind the vote of 1912.\\n', '\\n', '=President Wilson Urges Peace upon the Warring Nations.=--Apparently\\n', 'convinced that his pacific policies had been profoundly approved by his\\n', 'countrymen, President Wilson, soon after the election, addressed \"peace\\n', 'notes\" to the European belligerents. On December 16, the German Emperor\\n', 'proposed to the Allied Powers that they enter into peace negotiations, a\\n', 'suggestion that was treated as a mere political maneuver by the opposing\\n', 'governments. Two days later President Wilson sent a note to the warring\\n', 'nations asking them to avow \"the terms upon which war might be\\n', 'concluded.\" To these notes the Central Powers replied that they were\\n', 'ready to meet their antagonists in a peace conference; and Allied Powers\\n', 'answered by presenting certain conditions precedent to a satisfactory\\n', 'settlement. On January 22, 1917, President Wilson in an address before\\n', 'the Senate, declared it to be a duty of the United States to take part\\n', 'in the establishment of a stable peace on the basis of certain\\n', 'principles. These were, in short: \"peace without victory\"; the right of\\n', 'nationalities to freedom and self-government; the independence of\\n', 'Poland; freedom of the seas; the reduction of armaments; and the\\n', 'abolition of entangling alliances. The whole world was discussing the\\n', \"President's remarkable message, when it was dumbfounded to hear, on\\n\", 'January 31, that the German ambassador at Washington had announced the\\n', 'official renewal of ruthless submarine warfare.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Steps toward War.=--Three days after the receipt of the news that the\\n', 'German government intended to return to its former submarine policy,\\n', 'President Wilson severed diplomatic relations with the German empire. At\\n', 'the same time he explained to Congress that he desired no conflict with\\n', 'Germany and would await an \"overt act\" before taking further steps to\\n', 'preserve American rights. \"God grant,\" he concluded, \"that we may not be\\n', 'challenged to defend them by acts of willful injustice on the part of\\n', 'the government of Germany.\" Yet the challenge came. Between February 26\\n', 'and April 2, six American merchant vessels were torpedoed, in most cases\\n', 'without any warning and without regard to the loss of American lives.\\n', 'President Wilson therefore called upon Congress to answer the German\\n', 'menace. The reply of Congress on April 6 was a resolution, passed with\\n', 'only a few dissenting votes, declaring the existence of a state of war\\n', 'with Germany. Austria-Hungary at once severed diplomatic relations with\\n', 'the United States; but it was not until December 7 that Congress, acting\\n', 'on the President\\'s advice, declared war also on that \"vassal of the\\n', 'German government.\"\\n', '\\n', '=American War Aims.=--In many addresses at the beginning and during the\\n', 'course of the war, President Wilson stated the purposes which actuated\\n', 'our government in taking up arms. He first made it clear that it was a\\n', 'war of self-defense. \"The military masters of Germany,\" he exclaimed,\\n', '\"denied us the right to be neutral.\" Proof of that lay on every hand.\\n', 'Agents of the German imperial government had destroyed American lives\\n', 'and American property on the high seas. They had filled our communities\\n', 'with spies. They had planted bombs in ships and munition works. They had\\n', 'fomented divisions among American citizens.\\n', '\\n', 'Though assailed in many ways and compelled to resort to war, the United\\n', 'States sought no material rewards. \"The world must be made safe for\\n', 'democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of\\n', 'political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no\\n', 'conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In a very remarkable message read to Congress on January 8, 1918,\\n', 'President Wilson laid down his famous \"fourteen points\" summarizing the\\n', 'ideals for which we were fighting. They included open treaties of peace,\\n', 'openly arrived at; absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas; the\\n', 'removal, as far as possible, of trade barriers among nations; reduction\\n', 'of armaments; adjustment of colonial claims in the interest of the\\n', 'populations concerned; fair and friendly treatment of Russia; the\\n', 'restoration of Belgium; righting the wrong done to France in 1871 in the\\n', 'matter of Alsace-Lorraine; adjustment of Italian frontiers along the\\n', 'lines of nationality; more liberty for the peoples of Austria-Hungary;\\n', 'the restoration of Serbia and Rumania; the readjustment of the Turkish\\n', 'Empire; an independent Poland; and an association of nations to afford\\n', 'mutual guarantees to all states great and small. On a later occasion\\n', 'President Wilson elaborated the last point, namely, the formation of a\\n', 'league of nations to guarantee peace and establish justice among the\\n', 'powers of the world. Democracy, the right of nations to determine their\\n', 'own fate, a covenant of enduring peace--these were the ideals for which\\n', 'the American people were to pour out their blood and treasure.\\n', '\\n', '=The Selective Draft.=--The World War became a war of nations. The\\n', 'powers against which we were arrayed had every able-bodied man in\\n', 'service and all their resources, human and material, thrown into the\\n', 'scale. For this reason, President Wilson summoned the whole people of\\n', 'the United States to make every sacrifice necessary for victory.\\n', 'Congress by law decreed that the national army should be chosen from all\\n', 'male citizens and males not enemy aliens who had declared their\\n', 'intention of becoming citizens. By the first act of May 18, 1917, it\\n', 'fixed the age limits at twenty-one to thirty-one inclusive. Later, in\\n', 'August, 1918, it extended them to eighteen and forty-five. From the men\\n', 'of the first group so enrolled were chosen by lot the soldiers for the\\n', 'World War who, with the regular army and the national guard, formed the\\n', 'American Expeditionary Force upholding the American cause on the\\n', 'battlefields of Europe. \"The whole nation,\" said the President, \"must be\\n', 'a team in which each man shall play the part for which he is best\\n', 'fitted.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Liberty Loans and Taxes.=--In order that the military and naval forces\\n', 'should be stinted in no respect, the nation was called upon to place its\\n', 'financial resources at the service of the government. Some urged the\\n', '\"conscription of wealth as well as men,\" meaning the support of the war\\n', 'out of taxes upon great fortunes; but more conservative counsels\\n', 'prevailed. Four great Liberty Loans were floated, all the agencies of\\n', 'modern publicity being employed to enlist popular interest. The first\\n', 'loan had four and a half million subscribers; the fourth more than\\n', 'was laid upon incomes beginning with four per cent on incomes in the\\n', 'lower ranges and rising to sixty-three per cent of that part of any\\n', 'An excess profits tax was laid upon all corporations and partnerships,\\n', 'rising in amount to sixty per cent of the net income in excess of\\n', 'thirty-three per cent on the invested capital. \"This,\" said a\\n', 'distinguished economist, \"is the high-water mark in the history of\\n', 'taxation. Never before in the annals of civilization has an attempt been\\n', 'made to take as much as two-thirds of a man\\'s income by taxation.\"\\n', '\\n', '=Mobilizing Material Resources.=--No stone was left unturned to provide\\n', 'the arms, munitions, supplies, and transportation required in the\\n', 'gigantic undertaking. Between the declaration of war and the armistice,\\n', 'Congress enacted law after law relative to food supplies, raw materials,\\n', 'railways, mines, ships, forests, and industrial enterprises. No power\\n', 'over the lives and property of citizens, deemed necessary to the\\n', 'prosecution of the armed conflict, was withheld from the government. The\\n', \"farmer's wheat, the housewife's sugar, coal at the mines, labor in the\\n\", 'factories, ships at the wharves, trade with friendly countries, the\\n', 'railways, banks, stores, private fortunes--all were mobilized and laid\\n', 'under whatever obligations the government deemed imperative. Never was a\\n', 'nation more completely devoted to a single cause.\\n', '\\n', 'wheat and coal and to take almost any steps necessary to prevent\\n', 'monopoly and excessive prices. By a series of measures, enlarging the\\n', 'principles of the shipping act of 1916, ships and shipyards were brought\\n', 'under public control and the government was empowered to embark upon a\\n', 'great ship-building program. In December, 1917, the government assumed\\n', 'for the period of the war the operation of the railways under a\\n', 'presidential proclamation which was elaborated in March, 1918, by act of\\n', 'Congress. In the summer of 1918 the express, telephone, and telegraph\\n', 'business of the entire country passed under government control. By war\\n', 'risk insurance acts allowances were made for the families of enlisted\\n', 'men, compensation for injuries was provided, death benefits were\\n', 'instituted, and a system of national insurance was established in the\\n', 'interest of the men in service. Never before in the history of the\\n', 'country had the government taken such a wise and humane view of its\\n', 'obligations to those who served on the field of battle or on the seas.\\n', '\\n', '=The Espionage and Sedition Acts.=--By the Espionage law of June 15,\\n', '1917, and the amending law, known as the Sedition act, passed in May of\\n', 'the following year, the government was given a drastic power over the\\n', 'expression of opinion. The first measure penalized those who conveyed\\n', 'information to a foreign country to be used to the injury of the United\\n', 'States; those who made false statements designed to interfere with the\\n', 'military or naval forces of the United States; those who attempted to\\n', 'stir up insubordination or disloyalty in the army and navy; and those\\n', 'who willfully obstructed enlistment. The Sedition act was still more\\n', 'severe and sweeping in its terms. It imposed heavy penalties upon any\\n', 'person who used \"abusive language about the government or institutions\\n', 'of the country.\" It authorized the dismissal of any officer of the\\n', 'government who committed \"disloyal acts\" or uttered \"disloyal language,\"\\n', 'and empowered the Postmaster General to close the mails to persons\\n', 'violating the law. This measure, prepared by the Department of Justice,\\n', 'encountered vigorous opposition in the Senate, where twenty-four\\n', 'Republicans and two Democrats voted against it. Senator Johnson of\\n', 'California denounced it as a law \"to suppress the freedom of the press\\n', 'in the United States and to prevent any man, no matter who he is, from\\n', 'expressing legitimate criticism concerning the present government.\" The\\n', 'constitutionality of the acts was attacked; but they were sustained by\\n', 'the Supreme Court and stringently enforced.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Labor and the War.=--In view of the restlessness of European labor\\n', 'during the war and especially the proletarian revolution in Russia in\\n', 'November, 1917, some anxiety was early expressed as to the stand which\\n', 'organized labor might take in the United States. It was, however, soon\\n', 'dispelled. Samuel Gompers, speaking for the American Federation of\\n', 'Labor, declared that \"this is labor\\'s war,\" and pledged the united\\n', 'support of all the unions. There was some dissent. The Socialist party\\n', 'denounced the war as a capitalist quarrel; but all the protests combined\\n', 'were too slight to have much effect. American labor leaders were sent to\\n', 'Europe to strengthen the wavering ranks of trade unionists in war-worn\\n', 'England, France, and Italy. Labor was given representation on the\\n', 'important boards and commissions dealing with industrial questions.\\n', 'Trade union standards were accepted by the government and generally\\n', 'applied in industry. The Department of Labor became one of the powerful\\n', 'war centers of the nation. In a memorable address to the American\\n', 'Federation of Labor, President Wilson assured the trade unionists that\\n', 'labor conditions should not be made unduly onerous by the war and\\n', 'received in return a pledge of loyalty from the Federation. Recognition\\n', \"of labor's contribution to winning the war was embodied in the treaty of\\n\", 'peace, which provided for a permanent international organization to\\n', 'promote the world-wide effort of labor to improve social conditions.\\n', '\"The league of nations has for its object the establishment of universal\\n', 'peace,\" runs the preamble to the labor section of the treaty, \"and such\\n', 'a peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice....\\n', 'The failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labor is an\\n', 'obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the\\n', 'conditions in their own countries.\"\\n', '\\n', '=The American Navy in the War.=--As soon as Congress declared war the\\n', 'fleet was mobilized, American ports were thrown open to the warships of\\n', 'the Allies, immediate provision was made for increasing the number of\\n', 'men and ships, and a contingent of war vessels was sent to cooperate\\n', 'with the British and French in their life-and-death contest with\\n', 'submarines. Special effort was made to stimulate the production of\\n', '\"submarine chasers\" and \"scout cruisers\" to be sent to the danger zone.\\n', 'Convoys were provided to accompany the transports conveying soldiers to\\n', 'France. Before the end of the war more than three hundred American\\n', 'vessels and 75,000 officers and men were operating in European waters.\\n', 'Though the German fleet failed to come out and challenge the sea power\\n', 'of the Allies, the battleships of the United States were always ready to\\n', 'do their full duty in such an event. As things turned out, the service\\n', 'of the American navy was limited mainly to helping in the campaign that\\n', 'wore down the submarine menace to Allied shipping.\\n', '\\n', '=The War in France.=--Owing to the peculiar character of the warfare in\\n', 'France, it required a longer time for American military forces to get\\n', 'into action; but there was no unnecessary delay. Soon after the\\n', 'declaration of war, steps were taken to give military assistance to the\\n', 'Allies. The regular army was enlarged and the troops of the national\\n', 'Pershing, chosen head of the American Expeditionary Forces, reached\\n', 'Paris and began preparations for the arrival of our troops. In June, the\\n', 'As soon as the men enrolled under the draft were ready, it became a\\n', 'flood. During the period of the war the army was enlarged from about\\n', 'when the armistice was signed.\\n', '\\n', 'Although American troops did not take part on a large scale until the\\n', 'last phase of the war in 1918, several battalions of infantry were in\\n', 'the trenches by October, 1917, and had their first severe encounter with\\n', 'the Germans early in November. In January, 1918, they took over a part\\n', 'of the front line as an American sector. In March, General Pershing\\n', 'placed our forces at the disposal of General Foch, commander-in-chief of\\n', 'the Allied armies. The first division, which entered the Montdidier\\n', 'salient in April, soon was engaged with the enemy, \"taking with splendid\\n', 'dash the town of Cantigny and all other objectives, which were organized\\n', 'and held steadfastly against vicious counter attacks and galling\\n', 'artillery fire.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'When the Germans launched their grand drives toward the Marne and Paris,\\n', \"in June and July, 1918, every available man was placed at General Foch's\\n\", 'command. At Belleau Wood, at Chateau-Thierry, and other points along the\\n', 'deep salient made by the Germans into the French lines, American\\n', 'soldiers distinguished themselves by heroic action. They also played an\\n', 'important role in the counter attack that \"smashed\" the salient and\\n', 'drove the Germans back.\\n', '\\n', 'In September, American troops, with French aid, \"wiped out\" the German\\n', 'salient at St. Mihiel. By this time General Pershing was ready for the\\n', 'great American drive to the northeast in the Argonne forest, while he\\n', 'also cooperated with the British in the assault on the Hindenburg line.\\n', 'In the Meuse-Argonne battle, our soldiers encountered some of the most\\n', 'severe fighting of the war and pressed forward steadily against the most\\n', 'stubborn resistance from the enemy. On the 6th of November, reported\\n', 'General Pershing, \"a division of the first corps reached a point on the\\n', 'Meuse opposite Sedan, twenty-five miles from our line of departure. The\\n', 'strategical goal which was our highest hope was gained. We had cut the\\n', \"enemy's main line of communications and nothing but a surrender or an\\n\", 'armistice could save his army from complete disaster.\" Five days later\\n', 'the end came. On the morning of November 11, the order to cease firing\\n', 'went into effect. The German army was in rapid retreat and\\n', 'demoralization had begun. The Kaiser had abdicated and fled into\\n', 'Holland. The Hohenzollern dreams of empire were shattered. In the\\n', 'fifty-second month, the World War, involving nearly every civilized\\n', 'nation on the globe, was brought to a close. More than 75,000 American\\n', 'soldiers and sailors had given their lives. More than 250,000 had been\\n', 'wounded or were missing or in German prison camps.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Peace Conference.=--On January 18, 1919, a conference of the Allied\\n', 'and Associated Powers assembled to pronounce judgment upon the German\\n', 'empire and its defeated satellites: Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and\\n', 'Turkey. It was a moving spectacle. Seventy-two delegates spoke for\\n', 'thirty-two states. The United States, Great Britain, France, Italy, and\\n', 'Japan had five delegates each. Belgium, Brazil, and Serbia were each\\n', 'assigned three. Canada, Australia, South Africa, India, China, Greece,\\n', 'Hedjaz, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Siam, and Czechoslovakia were\\n', 'allotted two apiece. The remaining states of New Zealand, Bolivia, Cuba,\\n', 'Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru,\\n', 'and Uruguay each had one delegate. President Wilson spoke in person for\\n', 'the United States. England, France, and Italy were represented by their\\n', 'premiers: David Lloyd George, Georges Clemenceau, and Vittorio Orlando.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The Supreme Council.=--The real work of the settlement was first\\n', 'committed to a Supreme Council of ten representing the United States,\\n', 'Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan. This was later reduced to five\\n', 'members. Then Japan dropped out and finally Italy, leaving only\\n', 'President Wilson and the Premiers, Lloyd George and Clemenceau, the\\n', '\"Big Three,\" who assumed the burden of mighty decisions. On May 6, their\\n', 'work was completed and in a secret session of the full conference the\\n', 'whole treaty of peace was approved, though a few of the powers made\\n', 'reservations or objections. The next day the treaty was presented to the\\n', 'Germans who, after prolonged protests, signed on the last day of grace,\\n', 'June 28. This German treaty was followed by agreements with Austria,\\n', 'Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey. Collectively these great documents formed\\n', 'the legal basis of the general European settlement.\\n', '\\n', '=The Terms of the Settlement.=--The combined treaties make a huge\\n', 'volume. The German treaty alone embraces about 80,000 words.\\n', 'Collectively they cover an immense range of subjects which may be\\n', 'summarized under five heads: (1) The territorial settlement in Europe;\\n', 'damages done by Germany and her allies; (4) the disposition of German\\n', 'colonies and protectorates; and (5) the League of Nations.\\n', '\\n', 'Germany was reduced by the cession of Alsace-Lorraine to France and the\\n', 'loss of several other provinces. Austria-Hungary was dissolved and\\n', 'dismembered. Russia was reduced by the creation of new states on the\\n', 'west. Bulgaria was stripped of her gains in the recent Balkan wars.\\n', 'Turkey was dismembered. Nine new independent states were created:\\n', 'Poland, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia,\\n', 'Armenia, and Hedjaz. Italy, Greece, Rumania, and Serbia were enlarged by\\n', 'cessions of territory and Serbia was transformed into the great state of\\n', 'Jugoslavia.\\n', '\\n', 'The destruction of German military power was thorough. The entire navy,\\n', 'with minor exceptions, was turned over to the Allied and Associated\\n', \"Powers; Germany's total equipment for the future was limited to six\\n\", 'battleships and six light cruisers, with certain small vessels but no\\n', 'submarines. The number of enlisted men and officers for the army was\\n', 'fixed at not more than 100,000; the General Staff was dissolved; and the\\n', 'manufacture of munitions restricted.\\n', '\\n', 'Germany was compelled to accept full responsibility for all damages; to\\n', 'pay five billion dollars in cash and goods, and to make certain other\\n', 'payments which might be ordered from time to time by an inter-allied\\n', 'reparations commission. She was also required to deliver to Belgium,\\n', 'France, and Italy, millions of tons of coal every year for ten years;\\n', 'while by way of additional compensation to France the rich coal basin of\\n', 'the Saar was placed under inter-allied control to be exploited under\\n', 'French administration for a period of at least fifteen years. Austria\\n', 'and the other associates of Germany were also laid under heavy\\n', 'obligations to the victors. Damages done to shipping by submarines and\\n', 'other vessels were to be paid for on the basis of ton for ton.\\n', '\\n', 'The disposition of the German colonies and the old Ottoman empire\\n', 'presented knotty problems. It was finally agreed that the German\\n', 'colonies and Turkish provinces which were in a backward stage of\\n', 'development should be placed under the tutelage of certain powers acting\\n', 'as \"mandatories\" holding them in \"a sacred trust of civilization.\" An\\n', 'exception to the mandatory principle arose in the case of German rights\\n', 'in Shantung, all of which were transferred directly to Japan. It was\\n', 'this arrangement that led the Chinese delegation to withhold their\\n', 'signatures from the treaty.\\n', '\\n', '=The League of Nations.=--High among the purposes which he had in mind\\n', 'in summoning the nation to arms, President Wilson placed the desire to\\n', 'put an end to war. All through the United States the people spoke of the\\n', '\"war to end war.\" No slogan called forth a deeper response from the\\n', 'public. The President himself repeatedly declared that a general\\n', 'association of nations must be formed to guard the peace and protect all\\n', 'on opening the Fourth Liberty Loan campaign, \"the constitution of the\\n', 'League of Nations and the clear definition of its objects must be a\\n', 'part, in a sense the most essential part, of the peace settlement\\n', 'itself.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Nothing was more natural, therefore, than Wilson's insistence at Paris\\n\", 'upon the formation of an international association. Indeed he had gone\\n', 'to Europe in person largely to accomplish that end. Part One of the\\n', 'treaty with Germany, the Covenant of the League of Nations, was due to\\n', 'his labors more than to any other influence. Within the League thus\\n', 'created were to be embraced all the Allied and Associated Powers and\\n', 'nearly all the neutrals. By a two-thirds vote of the League Assembly the\\n', 'excluded nations might be admitted.\\n', '\\n', 'The agencies of the League of Nations were to be three in number: (1) a\\n', 'permanent secretariat located at Geneva; (2) an Assembly consisting of\\n', 'one delegate from each country, dominion, or self-governing colony\\n', 'and a Council consisting of representatives of the United States, Great\\n', 'Britain, France, Italy, and Japan, and four other representatives\\n', 'selected by the Assembly from time to time.\\n', '\\n', 'The duties imposed on the League and the obligations accepted by its\\n', 'members were numerous and important. The Council was to take steps to\\n', 'formulate a scheme for the reduction of armaments and to submit a plan\\n', 'for the establishment of a permanent Court of International Justice. The\\n', 'against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing\\n', 'political independence of all the associated nations. They were to\\n', 'submit to arbitration or inquiry by the Council all disputes which could\\n', 'not be adjusted by diplomacy and in no case to resort to war until three\\n', 'months after the award. Should any member disregard its covenants, its\\n', 'action would be considered an act of war against the League, which would\\n', 'accordingly cut off the trade and business of the hostile member and\\n', 'recommend through the Council to the several associated governments the\\n', 'military measures to be taken. In case the decision in any arbitration\\n', 'of a dispute was unanimous, the members of the League affected by it\\n', 'were to abide by it.\\n', '\\n', 'Such was the settlement at Paris and such was the association of nations\\n', 'formed to promote the peace of the world. They were quickly approved by\\n', 'most of the powers, and the first Assembly of the League of Nations met\\n', 'at Geneva late in 1920.\\n', '\\n', '=The Treaty in the United States.=--When the treaty was presented to the\\n', 'United States Senate for approval, a violent opposition appeared. In\\n', 'that chamber the Republicans had a slight majority and a two-thirds vote\\n', 'was necessary for ratification. The sentiment for and against the treaty\\n', 'ran mainly along party lines; but the Republicans were themselves\\n', 'divided. The major portion, known as \"reservationists,\" favored\\n', 'ratification with certain conditions respecting American rights; while a\\n', 'small though active minority rejected the League of Nations in its\\n', 'entirety, announcing themselves to be \"irreconcilables.\" The grounds of\\n', 'this Republican opposition lay partly in the terms of peace imposed on\\n', 'Germany and partly in the Covenant of the League of Nations. Exception\\n', 'was taken to the clauses which affected the rights of American citizens\\n', 'in property involved in the adjustment with Germany, but the burden of\\n', 'against external aggression the political independence and territorial\\n', 'integrity of the members of the League was subjected to a specially\\n', 'heavy fire; while the treatment accorded to China and the sections\\n', 'affecting American internal affairs were likewise attacked as \"unjust\\n', 'and dangerous.\" As an outcome of their deliberations, the Republicans\\n', 'proposed a long list of reservations which touched upon many of the\\n', 'vital parts of the treaty. These were rejected by President Wilson as\\n', 'amounting in effect to a \"nullification of the treaty.\" As a deadlock\\n', 'ensued the treaty was definitely rejected, owing to the failure of its\\n', 'sponsors to secure the requisite two-thirds vote.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=The League of Nations in the Campaign of 1920.=--At this juncture the\\n', 'presidential campaign of 1920 opened. The Republicans, while condemning\\n', 'the terms of the proposed League, endorsed the general idea of an\\n', 'international agreement to prevent war. Their candidate, Senator\\n', 'definitely whether the League devised at Paris could be recast in such a\\n', 'manner as to meet his requirements. The Democrats, on the other hand,\\n', 'while not opposing limitations clarifying the obligations of the United\\n', 'States, demanded \"the immediate ratification of the treaty without\\n', 'reservations which would impair its essential integrity.\" The Democratic\\n', 'that the United States should \"go into the League,\" without closing the\\n', 'door to mild reservations; he appealed to the country largely on that\\n', 'issue. The election of Senator Harding, in an extraordinary \"landslide,\"\\n', 'coupled with the return of a majority of Republicans to the Senate, made\\n', 'uncertain American participation in the League of Nations.\\n', '\\n', '=The United States and International Entanglements.=--Whether America\\n', 'entered the League or not, it could not close its doors to the world and\\n', 'escape perplexing international complications. It had ever-increasing\\n', 'financial and commercial connections with all other countries. Our\\n', 'associates in the recent war were heavily indebted to our government.\\n', 'The prosperity of American industries depended to a considerable extent\\n', 'upon the recovery of the impoverished and battle-torn countries of\\n', 'Europe.\\n', '\\n', 'There were other complications no less specific. The United States was\\n', 'compelled by force of circumstances to adopt a Russian policy. The\\n', 'government of the Czar had been overthrown by a liberal revolution,\\n', 'which in turn had been succeeded by an extreme, communist\\n', '\"dictatorship.\" The Bolsheviki, or majority faction of the socialists,\\n', 'had obtained control of the national council of peasants, workingmen,\\n', 'and soldiers, called the soviet, and inaugurated a radical regime. They\\n', 'had made peace with Germany in March, 1918. Thereupon the United States\\n', 'joined England, France, and Japan in an unofficial war upon them. After\\n', 'the general settlement at Paris in 1919, our government, while\\n', 'withdrawing troops from Siberia and Archangel, continued in its refusal\\n', 'to recognize the Bolshevists or to permit unhampered trade with them.\\n', 'President Wilson repeatedly denounced them as the enemies of\\n', 'civilization and undertook to lay down for all countries the principles\\n', 'which should govern intercourse with Russia.\\n', '\\n', 'Further international complications were created in connection with the\\n', 'World War, wholly apart from the terms of peace or the League of\\n', 'Nations. The United States had participated in a general European\\n', 'conflict which changed the boundaries of countries, called into being\\n', 'new nations, and reduced the power and territories of the vanquished.\\n', 'Accordingly, it was bound to face the problem of how far it was prepared\\n', \"to cooperate with the victors in any settlement of Europe's\\n\", 'difficulties. By no conceivable process, therefore, could America be\\n', 'disentangled from the web of world affairs. Isolation, if desirable, had\\n', 'become impossible. Within three hundred years from the founding of the\\n', 'tiny settlements at Jamestown and Plymouth, America, by virtue of its\\n', 'institutions, its population, its wealth, and its commerce, had become\\n', 'first among the nations of the earth. By moral obligations and by\\n', 'practical interests its fate was thus linked with the destiny of all\\n', 'mankind.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The astounding industrial progress that characterized the period\\n', 'following the Civil War bequeathed to the new generation many perplexing\\n', 'problems connected with the growth of trusts and railways, the\\n', 'accumulation of great fortunes, the increase of poverty in the\\n', 'industrial cities, the exhaustion of the free land, and the acquisition\\n', 'of dominions in distant seas. As long as there was an abundance of land\\n', 'in the West any able-bodied man with initiative and industry could\\n', 'become an independent farmer. People from the cities and immigrants from\\n', 'Europe had always before them that gateway to property and prosperity.\\n', 'When the land was all gone, American economic conditions inevitably\\n', 'became more like those of Europe.\\n', '\\n', 'Though the new economic questions had been vigorously debated in many\\n', 'circles before his day, it was President Roosevelt who first discussed\\n', 'them continuously from the White House. The natural resources of the\\n', 'country were being exhausted; he advocated their conservation. Huge\\n', 'fortunes were being made in business creating inequalities in\\n', 'opportunity; he favored reducing them by income and inheritance taxes.\\n', 'Industries were disturbed by strikes; he pressed arbitration upon\\n', 'capital and labor. The free land was gone; he declared that labor was in\\n', 'a less favorable position to bargain with capital and therefore should\\n', 'organize in unions for collective bargaining. There had been wrong-doing\\n', 'on the part of certain great trusts; those responsible should be\\n', 'punished.\\n', '\\n', 'The spirit of reform was abroad in the land. The spoils system was\\n', 'attacked. It was alleged that the political parties were dominated by\\n', '\"rings and bosses.\" The United States Senate was called \"a millionaires\\'\\n', 'club.\" Poverty and misery were observed in the cities. State\\n', 'legislatures and city governments were accused of corruption.\\n', '\\n', 'In answer to the charges, remedies were proposed and adopted. Civil\\n', 'service reform was approved. The Australian ballot, popular election of\\n', 'Senators, the initiative, referendum, and recall, commission and city\\n', 'manager plans for cities, public regulation of railways, compensation\\n', 'for those injured in industries, minimum wages for women and children,\\n', 'pensions for widows, the control of housing in the cities--these and a\\n', 'hundred other reforms were adopted and tried out. The national watchword\\n', 'became: \"America, Improve Thyself.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The spirit of reform broke into both political parties. It appeared in\\n', \"many statutes enacted by Congress under President Taft's leadership. It\\n\", 'disrupted the Republicans temporarily in 1912 when the Progressive party\\n', 'entered the field. It led the Democratic candidate in that year,\\n', 'Governor Wilson, to make a \"progressive appeal\" to the voters. It\\n', 'inspired a considerable program of national legislation under President\\n', \"Wilson's two administrations.\\n\", '\\n', 'In the age of change, four important amendments to the federal\\n', 'constitution, the first in more than forty years, were adopted. The\\n', 'sixteenth empowered Congress to lay an income tax. The seventeenth\\n', 'assured popular election of Senators. The eighteenth made prohibition\\n', 'national. The nineteenth, following upon the adoption of woman suffrage\\n', 'in many states, enfranchised the women of the nation.\\n', '\\n', 'In the sphere of industry, equally great changes took place. The major\\n', \"portion of the nation's business passed into the hands of corporations.\\n\", 'In all the leading industries of the country labor was organized into\\n', 'trade unions and federated in a national organization. The power of\\n', 'organized capital and organized labor loomed upon the horizon. Their\\n', 'struggles, their rights, and their place in the economy of the nation\\n', 'raised problems of the first magnitude.\\n', '\\n', 'While the country was engaged in a heated debate upon its domestic\\n', 'issues, the World War broke out in Europe in 1914. As a hundred years\\n', 'before, American rights upon the high seas became involved at once. They\\n', 'were invaded on both sides; but Germany, in addition to assailing\\n', 'American ships and property, ruthlessly destroyed American lives. She\\n', 'set at naught the rules of civilized warfare upon the sea. Warnings from\\n', 'President Wilson were without avail. Nothing could stay the hand of the\\n', 'German war party.\\n', '\\n', 'After long and patient negotiations, President Wilson in 1917 called\\n', 'upon the nation to take up arms against an assailant that had in effect\\n', 'declared war upon America. The answer was swift and firm. The national\\n', 'resources, human and material, were mobilized. The navy was enlarged, a\\n', 'draft army created, huge loans floated, heavy taxes laid, and the spirit\\n', 'of sacrifice called forth in a titanic struggle against an autocratic\\n', 'power that threatened to dominate Europe and the World.\\n', '\\n', 'In the end, American financial, naval, and military assistance counted\\n', 'heavily in the scale. American sailors scoured the seas searching for\\n', 'the terrible submarines. American soldiers took part in the last great\\n', \"drives that broke the might of Germany's army. Such was the nation's\\n\", 'response to the President\\'s summons to arms in a war \"for democracy\" and\\n', '\"to end war.\"\\n', '\\n', 'When victory crowned the arms of the powers united against Germany,\\n', 'President Wilson in person took part in the peace council. He sought to\\n', 'redeem his pledge to end wars by forming a League of Nations to keep the\\n', 'peace. In the treaty drawn at the close of the war the first part was a\\n', 'covenant binding the nations in a permanent association for the\\n', 'settlement of international disputes. This treaty, the President offered\\n', 'to the United States Senate for ratification and to his country for\\n', 'approval.\\n', '\\n', 'Once again, as in the days of the Napoleonic wars, the people seriously\\n', 'discussed the place of America among the powers of the earth. The Senate\\n', 'refused to ratify the treaty. World politics then became an issue in the\\n', 'campaign of 1920. Though some Americans talked as if the United States\\n', 'could close its doors and windows against all mankind, the victor in the\\n', 'election, Senator Harding, of Ohio, knew better. The election returns\\n', 'were hardly announced before he began to ask the advice of his\\n', 'countrymen on the pressing theme that would not be downed: \"What part\\n', 'shall America--first among the nations of the earth in wealth and\\n', 'power--assume at the council table of the world?\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=General References=\\n', '\\n', 'Woodrow Wilson, _The New Freedom_.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'intervention).\\n', '\\n', 'Theodore Roosevelt, _America and the World War_.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '=Research Topics=\\n', '\\n', \"=President Wilson's First Term.=--Elson, _History of the United States_,\\n\", 'pp. 925-941.\\n', '\\n', '=The Underwood Tariff Act.=--Ogg, _National Progress_ (The American\\n', 'Nation Series), pp. 209-226.\\n', '\\n', '=The Federal Reserve System.=--Ogg, pp. 228-232.\\n', '\\n', '=Trust and Labor Legislation.=--Ogg, pp. 232-236.\\n', '\\n', '=Legislation Respecting the Territories.=--Ogg, pp. 236-245.\\n', '\\n', '=American Interests in the Caribbean.=--Ogg, pp. 246-265.\\n', '\\n', '=American Interests in the Pacific.=--Ogg, pp. 304-324.\\n', '\\n', '=Mexican Affairs.=--Haworth, pp. 388-395; Ogg, pp. 284-304.\\n', '\\n', '=The First Phases of the European War.=--Haworth, pp. 395-412; Ogg, pp.\\n', '325-343.\\n', '\\n', '=The Campaign of 1916.=--Haworth, pp. 412-418; Ogg, pp. 364-383.\\n', '\\n', '=America Enters the War.=--Haworth, pp. 422-440; pp. 454-475.
