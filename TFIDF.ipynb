The coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual\\n', 'effect--the mental energy began to yield before its influence--and the\\n', 'confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous situation\\n', 'had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. He was now thoroughly\\n', 'insensible, and there was no probability that he would be otherwise for\\n', 'many hours.\\n', '\\n', 'It is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror.

These\\n', 'thoughts, with a crowd of others equally fearful, flashed through my\\n', 'mind with a bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me\\n', 'beyond the possibility of making any exertion. The boat was going\\n', 'through the water at a terrible rate--full before the wind--no reef in\\n', 'either jib or mainsail--running her bows completely under the foam.

Several persons were standing over me, and\\n', 'Augustus, paler than death, was busily occupied in chafing my hands.\\n', 'Upon seeing me open my eyes, his exclamations of gratitude and joy\\n', 'excited alternate laughter and tears from the rough-looking personages\\n', 'who were present. The mystery of our being in existence was now\\n', 'soon explained. We had been run down by the whaling-ship, which was\\n', 'close-hauled, beating up to Nantucket with every sail she could venture\\n', 'to set, and consequently running almost at right angles to our own\\n', 'course. Several men were on the look-out forward, but did not perceive\\n', 'our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming in contact--their\\n', 'shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so terribly alarmed me. The\\n', 'our own little vessel would have passed over a feather, and without the\\n', 'least perceptible impediment to her progress. Not a scream arose from\\n', 'the deck of the victim--there was a slight grating sound to be heard\\n', 'mingling with the roar of wind and water, as the frail bark which was\\n', 'swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her destroyer--but\\n', 'this was all. Thinking our boat (which it will be remembered was\\n', 'dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless, the captain (Captain\\n', 'troubling himself further about the matter. Luckily, there were two\\n', 'of the look-out who swore positively to having seen some person at our\\n', 'ensued, when Block grew angry, and, after a while, said that “it was no\\n', 'business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells; that the ship\\n', 'should not put about for any such nonsense; and if there was a man run\\n', 'down, it was nobody’s fault but his own, he might drown and be dammed”\\n', ' or some language to that effect. Henderson, the first mate, now took the\\n', 'matter up, being justly indignant, as well as the whole ship’s crew,\\n', 'at a speech evincing so base a degree of heartless atrocity. He\\n', 'spoke plainly, seeing himself upheld by the men, told the captain he\\n', 'considered him a fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey\\n', 'his orders if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore.\\n', 'He strode aft, jostling Block (who turned pale and made no answer)\\n', 'on one side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm voice,\\n', 'Hard-a-lee! The men flew to their posts, and the ship went cleverly\\n', 'about. All this had occupied nearly five minutes, and it was supposed to\\n', 'be hardly within the bounds of possibility that any individual could be\\n', 'saved--allowing any to have been on board the boat. Yet, as the reader\\n', 'has seen, both Augustus and myself were rescued; and our deliverance\\n', 'seemed to have been brought about by two of those almost inconceivable\\n', 'pieces of good fortune which are attributed by the wise and pious to the\\n', 'special interference of Providence.\\n', '\\n', 'While the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat and\\n', 'seen me at the helm. They had just left the lee of the vessel (the moon\\n', 'still shining brightly) when she made a long and heavy roll to windward,\\n', 'and Henderson, at the same moment, starting up in his seat bawled out\\n', 'to his crew to back water. He would say nothing else--repeating his cry\\n', 'impatiently, back water! back water! The men put back as speedily as\\n', 'possible, but by this time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully\\n', 'under headway, although all hands on board were making great exertions\\n', 'to take in sail. In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung\\n', 'to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. Another huge\\n', 'lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of water nearly\\n', 'as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety was rendered obvious\\n', 'enough. The body of a man was seen to be affixed in the most singular\\n', 'manner to the smooth and shining bottom (the Penguin was coppered and\\n', 'copper-fastened), and beating violently against it with every movement\\n', 'of the hull. After several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches\\n', 'disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board--for the body\\n', 'proved to be my own. It appeared that one of the timber-bolts having\\n', 'started and broken a passage through the copper, it had arrested my\\n', 'a manner to her bottom. The head of the bolt had made its way through\\n', 'of my neck, forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the\\n', 'totally extinct. There was no surgeon on board. The captain, however,\\n', 'of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in the previous portion of the\\n', 'adventure.\\n', '\\n', 'In the meantime, Henderson had again put off from the ship, although\\n', 'the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. He had not been gone many\\n', 'minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our boat, and shortly\\n', 'afterward one of the men with him asserted that he could distinguish a\\n', 'cry for help at intervals amid the roaring of the tempest. This induced\\n', 'the hardy seamen to persevere in their search for more than half an\\n', 'hour, although repeated signals to return were made them by Captain\\n', 'Block, and although every moment on the water in so frail a boat was\\n', 'fraught to them with the most imminent and deadly peril. Indeed, it is\\n', 'nearly impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could\\n', 'have escaped destruction for a single instant. She was built, however,\\n', 'believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of some life-boats used on the\\n', 'coast of Wales.\\n', '\\n', 'After searching in vain for about the period of time just mentioned,\\n', 'it was determined to get back to the ship. They had scarcely made this\\n', 'resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark object that floated rapidly\\n', 'by. They pursued and soon overtook it. It proved to be the entire deck\\n', 'of the Ariel’s cuddy. Augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the\\n', 'last agonies. Upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached\\n', 'had myself tied around his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt, for\\n', 'the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and my so doing,\\n', 'it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving his life. The\\n', 'Ariel was slightly put together, and in going down her frame naturally\\n', 'went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as might have been expected, was\\n', 'lifted, by the force of the water rushing in, entirely from the\\n', 'main timbers, and floated (with other fragments, no doubt) to the\\n', 'surface--Augustus was buoyed up with it, and thus escaped a terrible\\n', 'death.\\n', '\\n', 'It was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin before\\n', 'he could give any account of himself, or be made to comprehend the\\n', 'nature of the accident which had befallen our boat. At length he became\\n', 'thoroughly aroused, and spoke much of his sensations while in the water.\\n', 'Upon his first attaining any degree of consciousness, he found himself\\n', 'beneath the surface, whirling round and round with inconceivable\\n', 'rapidity, and with a rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about\\n', 'his neck. In an instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward,\\n', 'when, his head striking violently against a hard substance, he again\\n', 'relapsed into insensibility. Upon once more reviving he was in fuller\\n', 'possession of his reason--this was still, however, in the greatest\\n', 'degree clouded and confused. He now knew that some accident had\\n', 'occurred, and that he was in the water, although his mouth was above\\n', 'the surface, and he could breathe with some freedom. Possibly, at this\\n', 'period the deck was drifting rapidly before the wind, and drawing him\\n', 'after it, as he floated upon his back. Of course, as long as he could\\n', 'have retained this position, it would have been nearly impossible that\\n', 'he should be drowned. Presently a surge threw him directly athwart the\\n', 'deck, and this post he endeavored to maintain, screaming at intervals\\n', 'for help. Just before he was discovered by Mr. Henderson, he had been\\n', 'obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into the sea,\\n', 'had given himself up for lost. During the whole period of his struggles\\n', 'he had not the faintest recollection of the Ariel, nor of the matters in\\n', 'and despair had taken entire possession of his faculties. When he was\\n', 'finally picked up, every power of his mind had failed him; and, as\\n', 'before said, it was nearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin\\n', 'was resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and\\n', 'after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours and a\\n', 'half) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot oil--a proceeding\\n', 'suggested by Augustus. The wound in my neck, although of an ugly\\n', 'its effects.\\n', '\\n', 'The Penguin got into port about nine o’clock in the morning, after\\n', 'encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off Nantucket.\\n', 'Both Augustus and myself managed to appear at Mr. Barnard’s in time for\\n', 'breakfast--which, luckily, was somewhat late, owing to the party over\\n', 'notice our jaded appearance--of course, it would not have borne a very\\n', 'rigid scrutiny. Schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way\\n', 'had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story told by some sailors\\n', 'in town of their having run down a vessel at sea and drowned some thirty\\n', 'or forty poor devils, had reference either to the Ariel, my companion,\\n', 'or myself. We two have since very frequently talked the matter over--but\\n', 'never without a shudder. In one of our conversations Augustus frankly\\n', 'confessed to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced\\n', 'so excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat\\n', 'he first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt himself\\n', 'sinking beneath its influence.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'with entire certainty, even from the most simple data. It might be\\n', 'never experienced a more ardent longing for the wild adventures incident\\n', 'to the life of a navigator than within a week after our miraculous\\n', 'deliverance. This short period proved amply long enough to erase from\\n', 'my memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the pleasurably\\n', 'exciting points of color, all the picturesqueness, of the late perilous\\n', 'accident. My conversations with Augustus grew daily more frequent and\\n', 'more intensely full of interest. He had a manner of relating his stories\\n', 'been sheer fabrications) well adapted to have weight with one of\\n', 'my enthusiastic temperament and somewhat gloomy although glowing\\n', 'imagination. It is strange, too, that he most strongly enlisted my\\n', 'feelings in behalf of the life of a seaman, when he depicted his more\\n', 'terrible moments of suffering and despair. For the bright side of the\\n', 'famine; of death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime\\n', 'dragged out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in\\n', 'an ocean unapproachable and unknown. Such visions or desires--for they\\n', 'myself in a measure bound to fulfil. Augustus thoroughly entered into my\\n', 'state of mind. It is probable, indeed, that our intimate communion had\\n', 'resulted in a partial interchange of character.\\n', '\\n', 'About eighteen months after the period of the Ariel’s disaster, the\\n', 'firm of Lloyd and Vredenburgh (a house connected in some manner with the\\n', 'and fitting out the brig Grampus for a whaling voyage. She was an old\\n', 'hulk, and scarcely seaworthy when all was done to her that could be\\n', 'vessels belonging to the same owners--but so it was. Mr. Barnard was\\n', 'appointed to command her, and Augustus was going with him. While the\\n', 'brig was getting ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency of\\n', 'the opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel. He found\\n', 'me by no means an unwilling listener--yet the matter could not be so\\n', 'easily arranged. My father made no direct opposition; but my mother went\\n', 'into hysterics at the bare mention of the design; and, more than all,\\n', 'difficulties, however, so far from abating my desire, only added fuel to\\n', 'intentions to Augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it\\n', 'sentiments of displeasure as well as of surprise. The intense hypocrisy\\n', 'every word and action of my life for so long a period of time--could\\n', 'only have been rendered tolerable to myself by the wild and burning\\n', 'long-cherished visions of travel.\\n', '\\n', 'leave much to the management of Augustus, who was employed for the\\n', 'greater part of every day on board the Grampus, attending to some\\n', 'arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold. At night,\\n', 'however, we were sure to have a conference and talk over our hopes.\\n', 'After nearly a month passed in this manner, without our hitting upon\\n', 'any plan we thought likely to succeed, he told me at last that he had\\n', 'occasionally two or three weeks at a time. The brig was to sail about\\n', 'the middle of June (June, 1827), and it was agreed that, a day or two\\n', 'before her putting to sea, my father was to receive a note, as usual,\\n', 'from Mr. Ross, asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with Robert\\n', 'and Emmet (his sons). Augustus charged himself with the inditing of\\n', 'this note and getting it delivered. Having set out as supposed, for New\\n', 'a hiding-place for me in the Grampus. This hiding-place, he assured me,\\n', 'would be rendered sufficiently comfortable for a residence of many\\n', 'proceeded so far on her course as to make any turning back a matter out\\n', 'the comforts of the cabin; and as to his father, he would only laugh\\n', 'heartily at the joke. Vessels enough would be met with by which a letter\\n', 'might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents.\\n', '\\n', 'The middle of June at length arrived, and every thing had been matured.\\n', 'to Augustus, who was waiting for me at the corner of a street. It had\\n', 'then slip on board the brig; but, as there was now a thick fog in our\\n', 'favor, it was agreed to lose no time in secreting me. Augustus led the\\n', 'thick seaman’s cloak, which he had brought with him, so that my person\\n', 'might not be easily recognized. Just as we turned the second corner,\\n', 'after passing Mr. Edmund’s well, who should appear, standing right in\\n', 'front of me, and looking me full in the face, but old Mr. Peterson, my\\n', 'grandfather. “Why, bless my soul, Gordon,” said he, after a long pause,\\n', 'of offended surprise, and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable\\n', 'tones--“sir! you are a sum’mat mistaken--my name, in the first place,\\n', 'you blackguard, than to call my new obercoat a darty one.” For my life\\n', 'which the old gentleman received this handsome rebuke. He started back\\n', 'two or three steps, turned first pale and then excessively red, threw up\\n', 'his spectacles, then, putting them down, ran full tilt at me, with\\n', 'his umbrella uplifted. He stopped short, however, in his career, as if\\n', 'struck with a sudden recollection; and presently, turning round, hobbled\\n', 'off down the street, shaking all the while with rage, and muttering\\n', 'between his teeth: “Won’t do--new glasses--thought it was Gordon--d--d\\n', 'good-for-nothing salt water Long Tom.”\\n', '\\n', 'After this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and arrived\\n', 'at our point of destination in safety. There were only one or two of\\n', 'the hands on board, and these were busy forward, doing something to the\\n', 'forecastle combings. Captain Barnard, we knew very well, was engaged\\n', 'at Lloyd and Vredenburgh’s, and would remain there until late in the\\n', 'evening, so we had little to apprehend on his account. Augustus went\\n', 'being noticed by the men at work. We proceeded at once into the cabin,\\n', 'and found no person there. It was fitted up in the most comfortable\\n', 'style--a thing somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel. There were four\\n', 'very excellent staterooms, with wide and convenient berths. There was\\n', 'carpet covering the floor of both the cabin and staterooms. The ceiling\\n', 'was full seven feet high, and, in short, every thing appeared of a more\\n', 'would allow me but little time for observation, insisting upon the\\n', 'necessity of my concealing myself as soon as possible. He led the way\\n', 'into his own stateroom, which was on the starboard side of the brig, and\\n', 'next to the bulkheads. Upon entering, he closed the door and bolted it.\\n', 'now found myself. It was about ten feet long, and had only one berth,\\n', 'the closet nearest the bulkheads there was a space of four feet square,\\n', 'containing a table, a chair, and a set of hanging shelves full of books,\\n', 'chiefly books of voyages and travels. There were many other little\\n', 'safe or refrigerator, in which Augustus pointed out to me a host of\\n', 'delicacies, both in the eating and drinking department.\\n', '\\n', 'He now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the carpet in\\n', 'one corner of the space just mentioned, letting me know that a portion\\n', 'of the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had been neatly cut out\\n', 'and again adjusted. As he pressed, this portion rose up at one end\\n', 'sufficiently to allow the passage of his finger beneath. In this manner\\n', 'he raised the mouth of the trap (to which the carpet was still fastened\\n', 'small taper by means of a phosphorous match, and, placing the light in a\\n', 'dark lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me follow.\\n', 'driven into the under side--the carpet, of course, resuming its original\\n', 'position on the floor of the stateroom, and all traces of the aperture\\n', 'being concealed.\\n', '\\n', 'The taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest\\n', 'on to the skirts of my friend’s coat. He brought me, at length,\\n', 'after creeping and winding through innumerable narrow passages, to an\\n', 'iron-bound box, such as is used sometimes for packing fine earthenware.\\n', 'It was nearly four feet high, and full six long, but very narrow. Two\\n', 'large empty oil-casks lay on the top of it, and above these, again, a\\n', 'vast quantity of straw matting, piled up as high as the floor of\\n', 'the cabin. In every other direction around was wedged as closely as\\n', 'possible, even up to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every\\n', 'species of ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of\\n', 'crates, hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less\\n', 'afterward found that Augustus had purposely arranged the stowage in this\\n', 'hold with a view to affording me a thorough concealment, having had only\\n', 'one assistant in the labour, a man not going out in the brig.\\n', '\\n', 'My companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could be\\n', 'removed at pleasure. He slipped it aside and displayed the interior, at\\n', 'covered the whole of its bottom, and it contained almost every article\\n', 'of mere comfort which could be crowded into so small a space, allowing\\n', 'me, at the same time, sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a\\n', 'sitting position or lying at full length. Among other things, there were\\n', 'some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full of\\n', 'water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna sausages, an\\n', 'enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a dozen bottles of\\n', 'sure, than any monarch ever experienced upon entering a new palace.\\n', 'Augustus now pointed out to me the method of fastening the open end\\n', 'of the box, and then, holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a\\n', 'piece of dark whipcord lying along it. This, he said, extended from my\\n', 'hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the lumber, to a\\n', 'nail which was driven into the deck of the hold, immediately beneath the\\n', 'enabled readily to trace my way out without his guidance, provided any\\n', 'unlooked-for accident should render such a step necessary. He now took\\n', 'his departure, leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious\\n', 'supply of tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as\\n', 'often as he could contrive to do so without observation. This was on the\\n', 'seventeenth of June.\\n', '\\n', 'hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice for the\\n', 'purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between two crates just\\n', 'expected to put to sea every hour, and in the bustle he would not easily\\n', 'open and shut, and presently he called in a low voice, asking if all was\\n', 'as comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail?” “She will be under\\n', 'chance of coming down again for some time--perhaps for three or four\\n', 'trap, do you creep along by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in.\\n', 'You will find my watch there--it may be useful to you, as you have no\\n', 'watch to your box, but am afraid of being missed.” With this he went up.\\n', '\\n', 'and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly commenced a\\n', 'permitted to exchange the box for the more roomy, although hardly more\\n', 'comfortable, accommodations of the cabin. My first care was to get the\\n', 'the books which had been so thoughtfully provided, and selected the\\n', 'expedition of Lewis and Clarke to the mouth of the Columbia. With this\\n', 'light with great care, and soon fell into a sound slumber.\\n', '\\n', 'looked at the watch; but it was run down, and there were, consequently,\\n', 'found excellent. What was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a\\n', 'state of absolute putrefaction! This circumstance occasioned me great\\n', 'inordinately long period of time. The close atmosphere of the hold might\\n', 'have had something to do with this, and might, in the end, be productive\\n', 'disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise, and, having wound up the\\n', 'watch, contented myself as well as possible.\\n', '\\n', 'Throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no person\\n', 'grossest inattention. What alarmed me chiefly was, that the water in\\n', 'thirst, having eaten freely of the Bologna sausages after the loss of my\\n', 'at the thought of indulging it, lest there might exist some pernicious\\n', 'influence, like that of burning charcoal, in the confined air of the\\n', 'hold. In the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in\\n', 'the main ocean, and a dull humming sound, which reached my ears as if\\n', 'could not imagine a reason for the absence of Augustus. We were surely\\n', 'far enough advanced on our voyage to allow of my going up. Some accident\\n', 'account for his suffering me to remain so long a prisoner, except,\\n', 'indeed, his having suddenly died or fallen overboard, and upon this idea\\n', 'had been baffled by head winds, and were still in the near vicinity of\\n', 'satisfied, from her continual inclination to the larboard, that she had\\n', 'been sailing all along with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter.\\n', 'Besides, granting that we were still in the neighborhood of the\\n', 'island, why should not Augustus have visited me and informed me of\\n', 'the circumstance? Pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of\\n', 'to the trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend,\\n', 'or get at least a little fresh air through the opening, and a further\\n', 'supply of water from the stateroom. While occupied with this thought,\\n', 'of profound sleep, or rather stupor. My dreams were of the most terrific\\n', 'description. Every species of calamity and horror befell me. Among other\\n', 'the most ghastly and ferocious aspect. Immense serpents held me in their\\n', 'embrace, and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully shining\\n', 'eyes. Then deserts, limitless, and of the most forlorn and awe-inspiring\\n', 'character, spread themselves out before me. Immensely tall trunks of\\n', 'trees, gray and leafless, rose up in endless succession as far as the\\n', 'eye could reach. Their roots were concealed in wide-spreading morasses,\\n', 'whose dreary water lay intensely black, still, and altogether terrible,\\n', 'beneath. And the strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality, and\\n', 'waving to and fro their skeleton arms, were crying to the silent waters\\n', 'for mercy, in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony\\n', 'burning sand-plains of Sahara. At my feet lay crouched a fierce lion\\n', 'of the tropics. Suddenly his wild eyes opened and fell upon me. With\\n', 'a conclusive bound he sprang to his feet, and laid bare his horrible\\n', 'teeth. In another instant there burst from his red throat a roar like\\n', 'possession of my senses. The paws of some huge and real monster were\\n', 'pressing heavily upon my bosom--his hot breath was in my ear--and his\\n', 'white and ghastly fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom.\\n', '\\n', 'Had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the utterance\\n', 'whatever it was, retained his position without attempting any immediate\\n', 'length breathed a faint ejaculation to God, and resigned myself to\\n', 'die. The sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent fury of the\\n', 'animal. He precipitated himself at full length upon my body; but what\\n', 'was my astonishment, when, with a long and low whine, he commenced\\n', 'licking my face and hands with the greatest eagerness, and with the\\n', 'myself upon the neck of my faithful follower and friend, relieved the\\n', 'long oppression of my bosom in a flood of the most passionate tears.\\n', '\\n', 'As upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the greatest\\n', 'indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress. For a long time\\n', 'in vain to account; and after busying myself with a thousand different\\n', 'conjectures respecting him, was forced to content myself with rejoicing\\n', 'that he was with me to share my dreary solitude, and render me comfort\\n', 'affection far more ardent than common; and never, certainly, did\\n', 'any creature more truly deserve it. For seven years he had been my\\n', 'inseparable companion, and in a multitude of instances had given\\n', 'had rescued him, when a puppy, from the clutches of a malignant little\\n', 'villain in Nantucket who was leading him, with a rope around his neck,\\n', 'to the water; and the grown dog repaid the obligation, about three years\\n', 'afterward, by saving me from the bludgeon of a street robber.\\n', '\\n', 'as before, for a very long period of time, how long, it was of course\\n', 'lantern, and the phosphorus-box not coming readily to hand. Upon finding\\n', 'been tempted to drink it, as well as to devour the remnant of mutton,\\n', 'the bone of which lay, well picked, by the opening of the box. The\\n', 'as with an ague, at the slightest movement or exertion. To add to my\\n', 'troubles, the brig was pitching and rolling with great violence, and\\n', 'the oil-casks which lay upon my box were in momentary danger of falling\\n', 'terrible sufferings from sea-sickness. These considerations determined\\n', 'me to make my way, at all hazards, to the trap, and obtain immediate\\n', 'the present, and bidding Tiger lie quiet, began at once my journey\\n', 'toward the trap.\\n', '\\n', 'In this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever apparent.\\n', 'very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath me; when, falling\\n', 'as the result. At length, upon making a push forward with all the energy\\n', 'of an iron-bound crate. The accident only stunned me for a few moments;\\n', 'roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely across my path, so as\\n', 'not move it a single inch from its position, it being closely wedged\\n', 'in among the surrounding boxes and ship-furniture. It became necessary,\\n', 'whipcord and seek out a new passage, or to climb over the obstacle, and\\n', 'resume the path on the other side. The former alternative presented too\\n', 'many difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder. In my\\n', 'hesitation, to summon up all my remaining strength and fortitude, and\\n', '\\n', 'a more serious task than my fears had led me to imagine. On each side of\\n', 'the narrow passage arose a complete wall of various heavy lumber, which\\n', 'the least blunder on my part might be the means of bringing down upon my\\n', 'head; or, if this accident did not occur, the path might be effectually\\n', 'blocked up against my return by the descending mass, as it was in front\\n', 'by the obstacle there. The crate itself was a long and unwieldy box,\\n', 'means in my power, to reach the top, with the hope of being thus enabled\\n', 'my strength would have proved utterly inadequate to the task of getting\\n', 'of the planks, and found that a very large one was loose. With my\\n', 'labour, in prying it entirely off; and getting it through the aperture,\\n', 'discovered, to my exceeding joy, that there were no boards on the\\n', 'opposite side--in other words, that the top was wanting, it being the\\n', 'still dreading lest some other person than Augustus might be in his\\n', 'state-room. The door, however, to my astonishment, remained steady, and\\n', 'nevertheless firm: with all my strength--it still did not give way: with\\n', 'rage, with fury, with despair--it set at defiance my utmost efforts; and\\n', 'it was evident, from the unyielding nature of the resistance, that the\\n', 'hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up, or that some\\n', 'immense weight had been placed upon it, which it was useless to think of\\n', 'removing.\\n', '\\n', 'could summon up no connected chain of reflection, and, sinking on the\\n', 'floor, gave way, unresistingly, to the most gloomy imaginings, in\\n', 'which the dreadful deaths of thirst, famine, suffocation, and premature\\n', 'interment crowded upon me as the prominent disasters to be encountered.\\n', 'arose, and felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture.\\n', 'to be a chain-cable. The only course now left me was to retrace my\\n', 'way to the box, and there either yield to my sad fate, or try so to\\n', 'tranquilize my mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape.\\n', 'mattress, Tiger threw himself at full length by my side, and seemed as\\n', 'if desirous, by his caresses, of consoling me in my troubles, and urging\\n', 'me to bear them with fortitude.\\n', '\\n', 'The singularity of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my\\n', 'attention. After licking my face and hands for some minutes, he would\\n', 'suddenly cease doing so, and utter a low whine. Upon reaching out my\\n', 'paws uplifted. This conduct, so frequently repeated, appeared strange,\\n', 'then supposed him hungry, and gave him a large piece of ham, which he\\n', 'devoured with avidity--afterward, however, resuming his extraordinary\\n', 'torments of thirst, and was about adopting this conclusion as the true\\n', 'paws, and that there might possibly be a wound upon some portion of his\\n', 'of the hair extending completely across it. Probing this with my finger,\\n', 'had the feeling of letter paper, through which the string had been\\n', 'fastened in such a manner as to bring it immediately beneath the left\\n', 'shoulder of the animal.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Augustus, and that some unaccountable accident having happened to\\n', 'prevent his relieving me from my dungeon, he had devised this method of\\n', 'acquainting me with the true state of affairs. Trembling with eagerness,\\n', 'before falling asleep; and, indeed, previously to my last journey to the\\n', 'for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious search for the missing\\n', 'articles; never, surely, was there a more tantalizing state of anxiety\\n', 'and suspense. At length, while groping about, with my head close to the\\n', 'a faint glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage. Greatly\\n', 'could bring it into view again, was obliged to feel along by the box\\n', 'innumerable narrow windings), and found that it proceeded from some\\n', 'was wondering how they came in such a place, when my hand fell upon two\\n', 'or three pieces of taper wax, which had been evidently mumbled by the\\n', 'Augustus. The small remnants of the wax were so mashed up among other\\n', 'them, and left them as they were. The phosphorus, of which there was\\n', 'with it, after much difficulty, to my box, where Tiger had all the while\\n', 'remained.\\n', '\\n', 'white slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not even that when\\n', 'that it became in some measure perceptible. Thus the gloom of my prison\\n', 'may be imagined, and the note of my friend, if indeed it were a note\\n', 'from him, seemed only likely to throw me into further trouble, by\\n', 'disquieting to no purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind.\\n', 'procuring light--such expedients precisely as a man in the perturbed\\n', 'sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for a similar\\n', 'purpose--each and all of which appear by turns to the dreamer the\\n', 'most reasonable and the most preposterous of conceptions, just as the\\n', 'reasoning or imaginative faculties flicker, alternately, one above the\\n', 'other. At last an idea occurred to me which seemed rational, and which\\n', 'light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole surface; and had\\n', 'however--nothing but a dreary and unsatisfactory blank; the illumination\\n', 'died away in a few seconds, and my heart died away within me as it went.\\n', '\\n', 'prior to this, had been in a condition nearly bordering on idiocy. There\\n', 'were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect sanity, and, now and\\n', 'then, even of energy; but these were few. It must be remembered that\\n', 'atmosphere of a close hold in a whaling vessel, and for a long portion\\n', 'of that time but scantily supplied with water. For the last fourteen\\n', 'provisions of the most exciting kind had been my chief, and, indeed,\\n', 'since the loss of the mutton, my only supply of food, with the exception\\n', 'of the sea-biscuit; and these latter were utterly useless to me, as\\n', 'they were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched\\n', 'every respect exceedingly ill. This will account for the fact that many\\n', 'miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last adventure with the\\n', 'The blunder itself would have been unimportant, had not my own folly and\\n', 'impetuosity rendered it otherwise--in my disappointment at not finding\\n', 'it away, it was impossible to say where.\\n', '\\n', 'it to the dog’s nose, and endeavored to make him understand that he must\\n', 'of the usual tricks for which his breed are famous,) he seemed to enter\\n', 'at once into my meaning, and, rummaging about for a few moments, soon\\n', 'found another considerable portion. Bringing me this, he paused awhile,\\n', 'and, rubbing his nose against my hand, appeared to be waiting for\\n', 'immediately made off again. It was now some minutes before he came\\n', 'back--but when he did come, he brought with him a large slip, which\\n', 'proved to be all the paper missing--it having been torn, it seems,\\n', 'fragments of the phosphorus were left--being guided by the indistinct\\n', 'glow one or two of the particles still emitted. My difficulties had\\n', 'words were written upon that side of the paper which had not been\\n', 'examined--but which side was that? Fitting the pieces together gave me\\n', 'no clew in this respect, although it assured me that the words (if there\\n', 'were any) would be found all on one side, and connected in a proper\\n', 'manner, as written. There was the greater necessity of ascertaining the\\n', 'point in question beyond a doubt, as the phosphorus remaining would be\\n', 'for some minutes thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind. At\\n', 'some unevenness on its surface, which a delicate sense of feeling might\\n', 'my finger very carefully over the side which first presented itself.\\n', 'in my previous attempt. The other, or under side, then, was that on\\n', 'which lay the writing, if writing there should finally prove to be.\\n', 'Having rubbed in the phosphorus, a brilliancy ensued as before--but this\\n', 'became distinctly visible. The glimmer, although sufficiently bright,\\n', 'would have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three\\n', 'words, which thus appeared--“blood--your life depends upon lying close.”\\n', '\\n', 'meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted to convey,\\n', 'that admonition, even although it should have revealed a story of\\n', 'imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing and yet indefinable\\n', 'received. And “blood,” too, that word of all words--so rife at all times\\n', 'with mystery, and suffering, and terror--how trebly full of import did\\n', 'it now appear--how chilly and heavily (disjointed, as it thus was, from\\n', 'any foregoing words to qualify or render it distinct) did its vague\\n', 'syllables fall, amid the deep gloom of my prison, into the innermost\\n', 'recesses of my soul!\\n', '\\n', 'Augustus had, undoubtedly, good reasons for wishing me to remain\\n', 'the mystery. Just after returning from my last journey to the trap, and\\n', 'before my attention had been otherwise directed by the singular conduct\\n', 'of trying to cut my way through the orlop deck. The half certainty which\\n', 'the first time, felt all the misery of my fate. In a paroxysm of despair\\n', 'intervals of reason and recollection.\\n', '\\n', 'horrors which encompassed me. For another twenty-four hours it was\\n', 'free use of the cordials with which Augustus had supplied me, but they\\n', 'only served to excite fever, without in the least degree assuaging\\n', 'strong peach liqueur at which my stomach revolted. The sausages were\\n', 'entirely consumed; of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the\\n', 'skin; and all the biscuit, except a few fragments of one, had been eaten\\n', 'momentarily, and with it the species of delirium which had distressed me\\n', 'more or less since my first falling asleep. For some hours past it had\\n', 'attempt at so doing was attended with the most depressing spasmodic\\n', 'action of the chest. But there was still another and very different\\n', 'source of disquietude, and one, indeed, whose harassing terrors had\\n', 'been the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the\\n', 'mattress. It arose from the demeanor of the dog.\\n', '\\n', 'the time to pay much attention to the circumstance. Soon afterward,\\n', 'sound close at my ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who was\\n', 'panting and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his\\n', 'This was repeated three or four times, until finally his behaviour\\n', 'He was now lying close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully,\\n', 'although in a kind of undertone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly\\n', 'perceive his eyes fastened upon me with an expression of the most deadly\\n', 'my way from the box at all hazards, and dispatch him, if his opposition\\n', 'pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate my\\n', 'altered position of his eyes), and displayed the whole of his white\\n', 'ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured them about\\n', 'my person, together with a large carving-knife which Augustus had left\\n', 'dog sprang with a loud growl toward my throat. The whole weight of his\\n', 'knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these protected\\n', 'pressing vigorously upon the woollen which enveloped my neck--yet,\\n', 'beneath the dog, and a few moments would place me completely in his\\n', 'me by main force, and dragging with me the blankets from the mattress.\\n', 'got through the door and closed it effectually against his pursuit.\\n', 'myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which might be\\n', 'supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar circumstances, and,\\n', 'it furiously upon the floor.\\n', '\\n', 'pronounced in an eager but subdued voice, issuing from the direction of\\n', 'the steerage. So unexpected was anything of the kind, and so intense was\\n', 'to reply. My powers of speech totally failed, and in an agony of terror\\n', 'lest my friend should conclude me dead, and return without attempting\\n', 'trembling convulsively, and gasping and struggling for utterance. Had\\n', 'it. There was a slight movement now audible among the lumber somewhere\\n', 'forward of my station. The sound presently grew less distinct, then\\n', 'to expect so much--he was going--he would abandon me--he was gone! He\\n', 'would leave me to perish miserably, to expire in the most horrible and\\n', 'loathesome of dungeons--and one word, one little syllable, would save\\n', 'than ten thousand times the agonies of death itself. My brain reeled,\\n', '\\n', 'pantaloons, and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor. Never did\\n', 'any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my ears! With the\\n', 'the word “Arthur!” repeated in a low tone, and one full of hesitation.\\n', 'at the top of my voice, “Augustus! oh, Augustus!” “Hush! for God’s sake\\n', 'placed, at the same moment, a bottle of water to my lips. Those only who\\n', 'have been suddenly redeemed from the jaws of the tomb, or who have known\\n', 'the insufferable torments of thirst under circumstances as aggravated as\\n', 'those which encompassed me in my dreary prison, can form any idea of the\\n', 'unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest of all\\n', 'physical luxuries afforded.\\n', '\\n', 'greatest avidity. He had brought with him a light in a dark lantern, and\\n', 'the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less comfort than the food and\\n', 'and he proceeded to recount what had happened on board during my\\n', 'incarceration.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'left the watch. This was on the twentieth of June. It will be remembered\\n', 'period, there was so constant a bustle on board, and so much running\\n', 'to and fro, especially in the cabin and staterooms, that he had had no\\n', 'chance of visiting me without the risk of having the secret of the trap\\n', 'doing as well as possible; and, therefore, for the two next days he\\n', 'felt but little uneasiness on my account--still, however, watching an\\n', 'opportunity of going down. It was not until the fourth day that he found\\n', 'one. Several times during this interval he had made up his mind to let\\n', 'his father know of the adventure, and have me come up at once; but we\\n', 'were still within reaching distance of Nantucket, and it was doubtful,\\n', 'from some expressions which had escaped Captain Barnard, whether he\\n', 'would not immediately put back if he discovered me to be on board.\\n', 'Besides, upon thinking the matter over, Augustus, so he told me, could\\n', 'in such case, to make myself heard at the trap. When, therefore, he\\n', 'considered everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet\\n', 'did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the watch,\\n', 'without taking with him any water or provisions, intending in the first\\n', 'place merely to call my attention, and get me to come from the box to\\n', 'the trap,--when he would go up to the stateroom and thence hand me down\\n', 'consequently, must have lasted for more than three entire days and\\n', 'experience and the assurance of others, to be acquainted with the strong\\n', 'soporific effects of the stench arising from old fish-oil when closely\\n', 'imprisoned, and the long period during which the brig had been used as a\\n', 'the period specified above.\\n', '\\n', 'Augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing the\\n', 'He was now at a loss what to do. It would take him some time to make his\\n', 'way through the lumber to my box, and in the meanwhile his absence would\\n', 'be noticed by Captain Barnard, who had occasion for his services every\\n', 'minute, in arranging and copying papers connected with the business of\\n', 'the voyage. He determined, therefore, upon reflection, to ascend, and\\n', 'await another opportunity of visiting me. He was the more easily induced\\n', 'to this resolve, as my slumber appeared to be of the most tranquil\\n', 'from my incarceration. He had just made up his mind on these points\\n', 'when his attention was arrested by an unusual bustle, the sound of\\n', 'which proceeded apparently from the cabin. He sprang through the trap\\n', 'as quickly as possible, closed it, and threw open the door of his\\n', 'stateroom. No sooner had he put his foot over the threshold than a\\n', 'pistol flashed in his face, and he was knocked down, at the same moment,\\n', 'by a blow from a handspike.\\n', '\\n', 'his throat; still he was able to see what was going on around him.\\n', 'His father was tied hand and foot, and lying along the steps of the\\n', 'companion-way, with his head down, and a deep wound in the forehead,\\n', 'from which the blood was flowing in a continued stream. He spoke not a\\n', 'word, and was apparently dying. Over him stood the first mate, eyeing\\n', 'him with an expression of fiendish derision, and deliberately searching\\n', 'his pockets, from which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a\\n', 'chronometer. Seven of the crew (among whom was the cook, a negro) were\\n', 'rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms, where they soon\\n', 'equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition. Besides Augustus and\\n', 'Captain Barnard, there were nine men altogether in the cabin, and these\\n', 'among the most ruffianly of the brig’s company. The villains now went\\n', 'upon deck, taking my friend with them after having secured his arms\\n', 'behind his back. They proceeded straight to the forecastle, which was\\n', 'fastened down--two of the mutineers standing by it with axes--two also\\n', 'at the main hatch. The mate called out in a loud voice: “Do you hear\\n', 'there below? tumble up with you, one by one--now, mark that--and no\\n', 'grumbling!” It was some minutes before any one appeared:--at last an\\n', 'Englishman, who had shipped as a raw hand, came up, weeping piteously,\\n', 'and entreating the mate, in the most humble manner, to spare his life.\\n', 'The only reply was a blow on the forehead from an axe. The poor fellow\\n', 'fell to the deck without a groan, and the black cook lifted him up in\\n', 'his arms as he would a child, and tossed him deliberately into the sea.\\n', 'Hearing the blow and the plunge of the body, the men below could now\\n', 'be induced to venture on deck neither by threats nor promises, until a\\n', 'and for a moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken.\\n', 'The mutineers, however, succeeded at last in closing the forecastle\\n', 'effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up.\\n', 'These six, finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without arms,\\n', 'submitted after a brief struggle. The mate gave them fair words--no\\n', 'doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield, for they had no\\n', 'difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck. The result proved his\\n', 'sagacity, no less than his diabolical villainy. All in the forecastle\\n', 'presently signified their intention of submitting, and, ascending one\\n', 'by one, were pinioned and then thrown on their backs, together with the\\n', 'first six--there being in all, of the crew who were not concerned in the\\n', 'mutiny, twenty-seven.\\n', '\\n', 'dragged to the gangway. Here the cook stood with an axe, striking each\\n', 'victim on the head as he was forced over the side of the vessel by the\\n', 'other mutineers. In this manner twenty-two perished, and Augustus had\\n', 'given himself up for lost, expecting every moment his own turn to come\\n', 'next. But it seemed that the villains were now either weary, or in\\n', 'some measure disgusted with their bloody labour; for the four remaining\\n', 'prisoners, together with my friend, who had been thrown on the deck with\\n', 'the rest, were respited while the mate sent below for rum, and the whole\\n', 'murderous party held a drunken carouse, which lasted until sunset. They\\n', 'now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the survivors, who lay\\n', 'not more than four paces off, and could distinguish every word said.\\n', 'Upon some of the mutineers the liquor appeared to have a softening\\n', 'effect, for several voices were heard in favor of releasing the captives\\n', 'altogether, on condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits.\\n', 'The black cook, however (who in all respects was a perfect demon,\\n', 'and who seemed to exert as much influence, if not more, than the\\n', 'mate himself), would listen to no proposition of the kind, and rose\\n', 'repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway.\\n', 'Fortunately he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be easily\\n', 'restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party, among whom was a\\n', 'line-manager, who went by the name of Dirk Peters. This man was the\\n', 'son of an Indian squaw of the tribe of Upsarokas, who live among the\\n', 'fastnesses of the Black Hills, near the source of the Missouri. His\\n', 'with the Indian trading-posts on Lewis river. Peters himself was one of\\n', 'not more than four feet eight inches high, but his limbs were of\\n', 'Herculean mould. His hands, especially, were so enormously thick and\\n', 'broad as hardly to retain a human shape. His arms, as well as legs,\\n', 'were bowed in the most singular manner, and appeared to possess no\\n', 'flexibility whatever. His head was equally deformed, being of immense\\n', 'size, with an indentation on the crown (like that on the head of most\\n', 'negroes), and entirely bald. To conceal this latter deficiency, which\\n', 'did not proceed from old age, he usually wore a wig formed of any\\n', 'hair-like material which presented itself--occasionally the skin of a\\n', 'Spanish dog or American grizzly bear. At the time spoken of, he had on a\\n', 'portion of one of these bearskins; and it added no little to the natural\\n', 'ferocity of his countenance, which betook of the Upsaroka character. The\\n', 'mouth extended nearly from ear to ear, the lips were thin, and seemed,\\n', 'like some other portions of his frame, to be devoid of natural pliancy,\\n', 'so that the ruling expression never varied under the influence of any\\n', 'emotion whatever. This ruling expression may be conceived when it is\\n', 'considered that the teeth were exceedingly long and protruding, and\\n', 'never even partially covered, in any instance, by the lips. To pass this\\n', 'man with a casual glance, one might imagine him to be convulsed with\\n', 'laughter, but a second look would induce a shuddering acknowledgment,\\n', 'that if such an expression were indicative of merriment, the merriment\\n', 'must be that of a demon. Of this singular being many anecdotes were\\n', 'prevalent among the seafaring men of Nantucket. These anecdotes went to\\n', 'prove his prodigious strength when under excitement, and some of them\\n', 'had given rise to a doubt of his sanity. But on board the Grampus, it\\n', 'seems, he was regarded, at the time of the mutiny, with feelings more of\\n', 'of Dirk Peters, because, ferocious as he appeared, he proved the main\\n', 'have frequent occasion to mention him hereafter in the course of my\\n', 'narrative--a narrative, let me here say, which, in its latter portions,\\n', 'will be found to include incidents of a nature so entirely out of the\\n', 'range of human experience, and for this reason so far beyond the limits\\n', 'and progressing science to verify some of the most important and most\\n', 'improbable of my statements.\\n', '\\n', 'After much indecision and two or three violent quarrels, it was\\n', 'determined at last that all the prisoners (with the exception of\\n', 'Augustus, whom Peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping as his\\n', 'clerk) should be set adrift in one of the smallest whaleboats. The\\n', 'mate went down into the cabin to see if Captain Barnard was still\\n', 'living--for, it will be remembered, he was left below when the mutineers\\n', 'came up. Presently the two made their appearance, the captain pale as\\n', 'death, but somewhat recovered from the effects of his wound. He spoke\\n', 'to the men in a voice hardly articulate, entreated them not to set him\\n', 'adrift, but to return to their duty, and promising to land them wherever\\n', 'they chose, and to take no steps for bringing them to justice. He might\\n', 'as well have spoken to the winds. Two of the ruffians seized him by the\\n', 'arms and hurled him over the brig’s side into the boat, which had been\\n', 'lowered while the mate went below. The four men who were lying on the\\n', 'deck were then untied and ordered to follow, which they did without\\n', 'attempting any resistance--Augustus being still left in his painful\\n', 'position, although he struggled and prayed only for the poor\\n', 'sea-biscuit and a jug of water were now handed down; but neither mast,\\n', 'sail, oar, nor compass. The boat was towed astern for a few minutes,\\n', 'during which the mutineers held another consultation--it was then\\n', 'finally cut adrift. By this time night had come on--there were neither\\n', 'moon nor stars visible--and a short and ugly sea was running, although\\n', 'there was no great deal of wind. The boat was instantly out of sight,\\n', 'and little hope could be entertained for the unfortunate sufferers who\\n', 'were in it. This event happened, however, in latitude 35 degrees 30’\\n', 'north, longitude 61 degrees 20’ west, and consequently at no very great\\n', 'distance from the Bermuda Islands. Augustus therefore endeavored to\\n', 'console himself with the idea that the boat might either succeed in\\n', 'reaching the land, or come sufficiently near to be fallen in with by\\n', 'vessels off the coast.\\n', '\\n', 'All sail was now put upon the brig, and she continued her original\\n', 'course to the southwest--the mutineers being bent upon some piratical\\n', 'expedition, in which, from all that could be understood, a ship was to\\n', 'be intercepted on her way from the Cape Verd Islands to Porto Rico. No\\n', 'attention was paid to Augustus, who was untied and suffered to go about\\n', 'anywhere forward of the cabin companion-way. Dirk Peters treated him\\n', 'with some degree of kindness, and on one occasion saved him from\\n', 'the brutality of the cook. His situation was still one of the most\\n', 'precarious, as the men were continually intoxicated, and there was no\\n', 'relying upon their continued good-humor or carelessness in regard to\\n', 'himself. His anxiety on my account he represented, however, as the most\\n', 'doubt the sincerity of his friendship. More than once he had resolved\\n', 'to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my being on board, but was\\n', 'restrained from so doing, partly through recollection of the atrocities\\n', 'he had already beheld, and partly through a hope of being able soon to\\n', 'bring me relief. For the latter purpose he was constantly on the watch;\\n', 'but, in spite of the most constant vigilance, three days elapsed after\\n', 'the boat was cut adrift before any chance occurred. At length, on the\\n', 'night of the third day, there came on a heavy blow from the eastward,\\n', 'and all hands were called up to take in sail. During the confusion which\\n', 'ensued, he made his way below unobserved, and into the stateroom.\\n', 'What was his grief and horror in discovering that the latter had\\n', 'been rendered a place of deposit for a variety of sea-stores and\\n', 'ship-furniture, and that several fathoms of old chain-cable, which had\\n', 'been stowed away beneath the companion-ladder, had been dragged thence\\n', 'to make room for a chest, and were now lying immediately upon the trap!\\n', 'To remove it without discovery was impossible, and he returned on\\n', 'deck as quickly as he could. As he came up, the mate seized him by the\\n', 'throat, and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin, was about\\n', 'flinging him over the larboard bulwark, when his life was again\\n', 'preserved through the interference of Dirk Peters. Augustus was now put\\n', 'in handcuffs (of which there were several pairs on board), and his feet\\n', 'lashed tightly together. He was then taken into the steerage, and thrown\\n', 'into a lower berth next to the forecastle bulkheads, with the assurance\\n', 'that he should never put his foot on deck again “until the brig was no\\n', 'longer a brig.” This was the expression of the cook, who threw him into\\n', 'the berth--it is hardly possible to say what precise meaning intended by\\n', 'the phrase. The whole affair, however, proved the ultimate means of my\\n', 'relief, as will presently appear.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'abandoned himself to despair, never hoping to leave the berth alive.\\n', 'He now came to the resolution of acquainting the first of the men who\\n', 'should come down with my situation, thinking it better to let me take my\\n', 'chance with the mutineers than perish of thirst in the hold,--for it had\\n', 'a plentiful supply even for four. As he was thinking on this subject,\\n', 'the idea came all at once into his head that it might be possible\\n', 'to communicate with me by the way of the main hold. In any other\\n', 'circumstances, the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have\\n', 'prevented him from attempting it; but now he had, at all events, little\\n', 'prospect of life, and consequently little to lose, he bent his whole\\n', 'mind, therefore, upon the task.\\n', '\\n', 'His handcuffs were the first consideration. At first he saw no method\\n', 'of removing them, and feared that he should thus be baffled in the very\\n', 'outset; but upon a closer scrutiny he discovered that the irons could\\n', 'be slipped off and on at pleasure, with very little effort or\\n', 'inconvenience, merely by squeezing his hands through them,--this species\\n', 'of manacle being altogether ineffectual in confining young persons,\\n', 'in whom the smaller bones readily yield to pressure. He now untied his\\n', 'feet, and, leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily\\n', 'be readjusted in the event of any person’s coming down, proceeded to\\n', 'examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth. The partition here was\\n', 'of soft pine board, an inch thick, and he saw that he should have\\n', 'forecastle companion-way, and he had just time to put his right hand\\n', 'into its handcuff (the left had not been removed) and to draw the rope\\n', 'in a slipknot around his ankle, when Dirk Peters came below, followed by\\n', 'Tiger, who immediately leaped into the berth and lay down. The dog had\\n', 'been brought on board by Augustus, who knew my attachment to the animal,\\n', 'and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me during the\\n', 'voyage. He went up to our house for him immediately after first taking\\n', 'me into the hold, but did not think of mentioning the circumstance upon\\n', 'his bringing the watch. Since the mutiny, Augustus had not seen him\\n', 'before his appearance with Dirk Peters, and had given him up for lost,\\n', 'supposing him to have been thrown overboard by some of the malignant\\n', 'villains belonging to the mate’s gang. It appeared afterward that he had\\n', 'crawled into a hole beneath a whale-boat, from which, not having room to\\n', 'turn round, he could not extricate himself. Peters at last let him out,\\n', 'and, with a species of good feeling which my friend knew well how to\\n', 'appreciate, had now brought him to him in the forecastle as a companion,\\n', 'leaving at the same time some salt junk and potatoes, with a can of\\n', 'water, he then went on deck, promising to come down with something more\\n', 'to eat on the next day.\\n', '\\n', 'When he had gone, Augustus freed both hands from the manacles and\\n', 'unfastened his feet. He then turned down the head of the mattress on\\n', 'which he had been lying, and with his penknife (for the ruffians had\\n', 'not thought it worth while to search him) commenced cutting vigorously\\n', 'across one of the partition planks, as closely as possible to the floor\\n', 'of the berth. He chose to cut here, because, if suddenly interrupted, he\\n', 'would be able to conceal what had been done by letting the head of the\\n', 'mattress fall into its proper position. For the remainder of the day,\\n', 'however, no disturbance occurred, and by night he had completely divided\\n', 'the plank. It should here be observed that none of the crew occupied the\\n', 'forecastle as a sleeping-place, living altogether in the cabin since\\n', 'the mutiny, drinking the wines and feasting on the sea-stores of Captain\\n', 'Barnard, and giving no more heed than was absolutely necessary to the\\n', 'navigation of the brig. These circumstances proved fortunate both for\\n', 'myself and Augustus; for, had matters been otherwise, he would have\\n', 'found it impossible to reach me. As it was, he proceeded with confidence\\n', 'in his design. It was near daybreak, however, before he completed the\\n', 'second division of the board (which was about a foot above the first\\n', 'cut), thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his passage\\n', 'through with facility to the main orlop deck. Having got here, he made\\n', 'his way with but little trouble to the lower main hatch, although in so\\n', 'doing he had to scramble over tiers of oil-casks piled nearly as high as\\n', 'the upper deck, there being barely room enough left for his body. Upon\\n', 'reaching the hatch he found that Tiger had followed him below, squeezing\\n', 'between two rows of the casks. It was now too late, however, to attempt\\n', 'getting to me before dawn, as the chief difficulty lay in passing\\n', 'through the close stowage in the lower hold. He therefore resolved to\\n', 'return, and wait till the next night. With this design, he proceeded to\\n', 'loosen the hatch, so that he might have as little detention as possible\\n', 'when he should come again. No sooner had he loosened it than Tiger\\n', 'sprang eagerly to the small opening produced, snuffed for a moment, and\\n', 'then uttered a long whine, scratching at the same time, as if anxious\\n', 'to remove the covering with his paws. There could be no doubt, from\\n', 'his behaviour, that he was aware of my being in the hold, and Augustus\\n', 'thought it possible that he would be able to get to me if he put him\\n', 'down. He now hit upon the expedient of sending the note, as it was\\n', 'at least under existing circumstances, and there could be no certainty\\n', 'of his getting to me himself on the morrow as he intended. After-events\\n', 'proved how fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did;\\n', 'have fallen upon some plan, however desperate, of alarming the crew, and\\n', 'both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed in consequence.\\n', '\\n', 'Having concluded to write, the difficulty was now to procure the\\n', 'materials for so doing. An old toothpick was soon made into a pen; and\\n', 'this by means of feeling altogether, for the between-decks was as\\n', 'dark as pitch. Paper enough was obtained from the back of a letter--a\\n', 'duplicate of the forged letter from Mr. Ross. This had been the original\\n', 'draught; but the handwriting not being sufficiently well imitated,\\n', 'Augustus had written another, thrusting the first, by good fortune, into\\n', 'his coat-pocket, where it was now most opportunely discovered. Ink alone\\n', 'was thus wanting, and a substitute was immediately found for this by\\n', 'means of a slight incision with the pen-knife on the back of a finger\\n', 'just above the nail--a copious flow of blood ensuing, as usual, from\\n', 'wounds in that vicinity. The note was now written, as well as it could\\n', 'be in the dark and under the circumstances. It briefly explained that a\\n', 'might expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned, but\\n', 'must not venture upon making any disturbance. It concluded with these\\n', 'words: “_I have scrawled this with blood--your life depends upon lying\\n', '\\n', 'This slip of paper being tied upon the dog, he was now put down the\\n', 'hatchway, and Augustus made the best of his way back to the forecastle,\\n', 'where he found no reason to believe that any of the crew had been in\\n', 'his absence. To conceal the hole in the partition, he drove his knife in\\n', 'just above it, and hung up a pea-jacket which he found in the berth. His\\n', 'handcuffs were then replaced, and also the rope around his ankles.\\n', '\\n', 'These arrangements were scarcely completed when Dirk Peters came below,\\n', 'very drunk, but in excellent humour, and bringing with him my friend’s\\n', 'allowance of provision for the day. This consisted of a dozen large\\n', 'Irish potatoes roasted, and a pitcher of water. He sat for some time on\\n', 'a chest by the berth, and talked freely about the mate and the general\\n', 'concerns of the brig. His demeanour was exceedingly capricious, and\\n', 'even grotesque. At one time Augustus was much alarmed by odd conduct.\\n', 'At last, however, he went on deck, muttering a promise to bring his\\n', 'prisoner a good dinner on the morrow. During the day two of the crew\\n', '(harpooners) came down, accompanied by the cook, all three in nearly the\\n', 'last stage of intoxication. Like Peters, they made no scruple of talking\\n', 'unreservedly about their plans. It appeared that they were much divided\\n', 'among themselves as to their ultimate course, agreeing in no point,\\n', 'except the attack on the ship from the Cape Verd Islands, with\\n', 'which they were in hourly expectation of meeting. As far as could be\\n', 'ascertained, the mutiny had not been brought about altogether for the\\n', 'sake of booty; a private pique of the chief mate’s against Captain\\n', 'Barnard having been the main instigation. There now seemed to be two\\n', 'principal factions among the crew--one headed by the mate, the other by\\n', 'the cook. The former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel\\n', 'which should present itself, and equipping it at some of the West India\\n', 'Islands for a piratical cruise. The latter division, however, which was\\n', 'the stronger, and included Dirk Peters among its partisans, were bent\\n', 'upon pursuing the course originally laid out for the brig into the South\\n', 'Pacific; there either to take whale, or act otherwise, as circumstances\\n', 'should suggest. The representations of Peters, who had frequently\\n', 'visited these regions, had great weight, apparently, with the mutineers,\\n', 'wavering, as they were, between half-engendered notions of profit and\\n', 'pleasure. He dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to be found\\n', 'among the innumerable islands of the Pacific, on the perfect security\\n', 'and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed, but, more particularly, on\\n', 'the deliciousness of the climate, on the abundant means of good living,\\n', 'and on the voluptuous beauty of the women. As yet, nothing had been\\n', 'absolutely determined upon; but the pictures of the hybrid line-manager\\n', 'were taking strong hold upon the ardent imaginations of the seamen, and\\n', 'there was every possibility that his intentions would be finally carried\\n', 'into effect.\\n', '\\n', 'The three men went away in about an hour, and no one else entered the\\n', 'forecastle all day. Augustus lay quiet until nearly night. He then freed\\n', 'was found in one of the berths, and this he filled with water from the\\n', 'pitcher left by Peters, storing his pockets at the same time with cold\\n', 'potatoes. To his great joy he also came across a lantern, with a small\\n', 'piece of tallow candle in it. This he could light at any moment, as he\\n', 'had in his possession a box of phosphorus matches. When it was quite\\n', 'dark, he got through the hole in the bulkhead, having taken the\\n', 'precaution to arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to convey the\\n', 'idea of a person covered up. When through, he hung up the pea-jacket\\n', 'on his knife, as before, to conceal the aperture--this manoeuvre being\\n', 'easily effected, as he did not readjust the piece of plank taken out\\n', 'until afterward. He was now on the main orlop deck, and proceeded to\\n', 'make his way, as before, between the upper deck and the oil-casks to\\n', 'the main hatchway. Having reached this, he lit the piece of candle, and\\n', 'descended, groping with extreme difficulty among the compact stowage of\\n', 'the hold. In a few moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench\\n', 'and the closeness of the atmosphere. He could not think it possible\\n', 'reply, and his apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed. The brig was\\n', 'rolling violently, and there was so much noise in consequence, that it\\n', 'was useless to listen for any weak sound, such as those of my breathing\\n', 'or snoring. He threw open the lantern, and held it as high as possible,\\n', 'whenever an opportunity occurred, in order that, by observing the light,\\n', 'was heard from me, and the supposition of my death began to assume the\\n', 'character of certainty. He determined, nevertheless, to force a passage,\\n', 'if possible, to the box, and at least ascertain beyond a doubt the truth\\n', 'of his surmises. He pushed on for some time in a most pitiable state of\\n', 'anxiety, until, at length, he found the pathway utterly blocked up, and\\n', 'that there was no possibility of making any farther way by the course\\n', 'in which he had set out. Overcome now by his feelings, he threw himself\\n', 'among the lumber in despair, and wept like a child. It was at this\\n', 'thrown down. Fortunate, indeed, was it that the incident occurred--for,\\n', 'upon this incident, trivial as it appears, the thread of my destiny\\n', 'Augustus from confiding to me at once what a more intimate and\\n', 'unreserved communion afterward induced him to reveal. Upon finding his\\n', 'further progress in the hold impeded by obstacles which he could not\\n', 'overcome, he had resolved to abandon his attempt at reaching me, and\\n', 'return at once to the forecastle. Before condemning him entirely on this\\n', 'head, the harassing circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken\\n', 'into consideration. The night was fast wearing away, and his absence\\n', 'from the forecastle might be discovered; and indeed would necessarily be\\n', 'so, if he should fail to get back to the berth by daybreak. His candle\\n', 'was expiring in the socket, and there would be the greatest difficulty\\n', 'in retracing his way to the hatchway in the dark. It must be allowed,\\n', 'too, that he had every good reason to believe me dead; in which event\\n', 'no benefit could result to me from his reaching the box, and a world of\\n', 'danger would be encountered to no purpose by himself. He had repeatedly\\n', 'nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he had\\n', 'release. The atmosphere of the hold, too, must have appeared to him,\\n', 'coming from the comparatively open air of the steerage, of a nature\\n', 'absolutely poisonous, and by far more intolerable than it had seemed to\\n', 'me upon my first taking up my quarters in the box--the hatchways at that\\n', 'time having been constantly open for many months previous. Add to these\\n', 'considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so lately\\n', 'witnessed by my friend; his confinement, privations, and narrow escapes\\n', 'from death, together with the frail and equivocal tenure by which he\\n', 'still existed--circumstances all so well calculated to prostrate every\\n', 'to regard his apparent falling off in friendship and in faith with\\n', 'sentiments rather of sorrow than of anger.\\n', '\\n', 'The crash of the bottle was distinctly heard, yet Augustus was not sure\\n', 'that it proceeded from the hold. The doubt, however, was sufficient\\n', 'inducement to persevere. He clambered up nearly to the orlop deck by\\n', 'means of the stowage, and then, watching for a lull in the pitchings of\\n', 'the vessel, he called out to me in as loud a tone as he could command,\\n', 'regardless, for the moment, of being overheard by the crew. It will\\n', 'so entirely overcome by violent agitation as to be incapable of reply.\\n', 'Confident, now, that his worst apprehensions were well founded, he\\n', 'descended, with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss\\n', 'of time. In his haste some small boxes were thrown down, the noise\\n', 'considerable progress on his return when the fall of the knife again\\n', 'caused him to hesitate. He retraced his steps immediately, and,\\n', 'clambering up the stowage a second time, called out my name, loudly as\\n', 'Overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive, he now resolved to brave\\n', 'every difficulty and danger in reaching me. Having extricated himself as\\n', 'quickly as possible from the labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed\\n', 'in, he at length struck into an opening which promised better, and\\n', 'finally, after a series of struggles, arrived at the box in a state of\\n', 'utter exhaustion.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'communicated to me while we remained near the box. It was not\\n', 'until afterward that he entered fully into all the details. He was\\n', 'my detested place of confinement. We resolved to make our way at once\\n', 'while he went through to reconnoiter. To leave Tiger in the box was what\\n', 'neither of us could endure to think of, yet, how to act otherwise was\\n', 'the question. He now seemed to be perfectly quiet, and we could not even\\n', 'distinguish the sound of his breathing upon applying our ears closely\\n', 'door. We found him lying at full length, apparently in a deep stupor,\\n', 'abandon an animal who had now been twice instrumental in saving my life,\\n', 'without some attempt at preserving him. We therefore dragged him along\\n', 'with us as well as we could, although with the greatest difficulty and\\n', 'fatigue; Augustus, during part of the time, being forced to clamber\\n', 'over the impediments in our way with the huge dog in his arms--a feat\\n', 'to which the feebleness of my frame rendered me totally inadequate. At\\n', 'length we succeeded in reaching the hole, when Augustus got through, and\\n', 'Tiger was pushed in afterward. All was found to be safe, and we did\\n', 'not fail to return sincere thanks to God for our deliverance from the\\n', 'should remain near the opening, through which my companion could readily\\n', 'advantages of breathing an atmosphere comparatively pure.\\n', '\\n', 'of the stowage of the brig, and which may appear ambiguous to some of my\\n', 'that the manner in which this most important duty had been performed\\n', 'on board the Grampus was a most shameful piece of neglect on the part\\n', 'of Captain Barnard, who was by no means as careful or as experienced a\\n', 'seaman as the hazardous nature of the service on which he was\\n', 'accomplished in a careless manner, and many most disastrous accidents,\\n', 'even within the limits of my own experience, have arisen from neglect\\n', 'or ignorance in this particular. Coasting vessels, in the frequent hurry\\n', 'and bustle attendant upon taking in or discharging cargo, are the most\\n', 'liable to mishap from the want of a proper attention to stowage. The\\n', 'great point is to allow no possibility of the cargo or ballast shifting\\n', 'position even in the most violent rollings of the vessel. With this end,\\n', 'great attention must be paid, not only to the bulk taken in, but to the\\n', 'nature of the bulk, and whether there be a full or only a partial cargo.\\n', 'In most kinds of freight the stowage is accomplished by means of a\\n', 'screw. Thus, in a load of tobacco or flour, the whole is screwed so\\n', 'tightly into the hold of the vessel that the barrels or hogsheads, upon\\n', 'discharging, are found to be completely flattened, and take some time\\n', 'to regain their original shape. This screwing, however, is resorted to\\n', 'principally with a view of obtaining more room in the hold; for in a\\n', 'full load of any such commodities as flour or tobacco, there can be no\\n', 'danger of any shifting whatever, at least none from which inconvenience\\n', 'can result. There have been instances, indeed, where this method of\\n', 'screwing has resulted in the most lamentable consequences, arising from\\n', 'a cause altogether distinct from the danger attendant upon a shifting of\\n', 'conditions, has been known, through the expansion of its bulk, to rend a\\n', 'vessel asunder at sea. There can be no doubt either that the same result\\n', 'would ensue in the case of tobacco, while undergoing its usual course\\n', 'of fermentation, were it not for the interstices consequent upon the\\n', 'rotundity of the hogsheads.\\n', '\\n', 'It is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to be\\n', 'apprehended from shifting, and that precautions should be always taken\\n', 'to guard against such misfortune. Only those who have encountered a\\n', 'violent gale of wind, or rather who have experienced the rolling of\\n', 'a vessel in a sudden calm after the gale, can form an idea of the\\n', 'tremendous force of the plunges, and of the consequent terrible impetus\\n', 'given to all loose articles in the vessel. It is then that the necessity\\n', 'of a cautious stowage, when there is a partial cargo, becomes obvious.\\n', 'When lying-to (especially with a small head sail), a vessel which is not\\n', 'properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon her beam-ends;\\n', 'this occurring even every fifteen or twenty minutes upon an average, yet\\n', 'without any serious consequences resulting, provided there be a proper\\n', 'stowage. If this, however, has not been strictly attended to, in the\\n', 'first of these heavy lurches the whole of the cargo tumbles over to the\\n', 'side of the vessel which lies upon the water, and, being thus prevented\\n', 'from regaining her equilibrium, as she would otherwise necessarily do,\\n', 'she is certain to fill in a few seconds and go down. It is not too much\\n', 'to say that at least one-half of the instances in which vessels have\\n', 'foundered in heavy gales at sea may be attributed to a shifting of cargo\\n', 'or of ballast.\\n', '\\n', 'When a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board, the whole, after\\n', 'being first stowed as compactly as may be, should be covered with a\\n', 'layer of stout shifting-boards, extending completely across the vessel.\\n', 'Upon these boards strong temporary stanchions should be erected,\\n', 'reaching to the timbers above, and thus securing every thing in its\\n', 'place. In cargoes consisting of grain, or any similar matter, additional\\n', 'leaving port will be found not more than three fourths full upon\\n', 'reaching its destination--this, too, although the freight, when measured\\n', 'bushel by bushel by the consignee, will overrun by a vast deal (on\\n', 'account of the swelling of the grain) the quantity consigned. This\\n', 'result is occasioned by settling during the voyage, and is the more\\n', 'perceptible in proportion to the roughness of the weather experienced.\\n', 'If grain loosely thrown in a vessel, then, is ever so well secured by\\n', 'shifting-boards and stanchions, it will be liable to shift in a long\\n', 'passage so greatly as to bring about the most distressing calamities.\\n', 'To prevent these, every method should be employed before leaving port\\n', 'to settle the cargo as much as possible; and for this there are many\\n', 'contrivances, among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into\\n', 'the grain. Even after all this is done, and unusual pains taken to\\n', 'secure the shifting-boards, no seaman who knows what he is about will\\n', 'feel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a cargo of\\n', 'grain on board, and, least of all, with a partial cargo. Yet there are\\n', 'hundreds of our coasting vessels, and, it is likely, many more from the\\n', 'ports of Europe, which sail daily with partial cargoes, even of the most\\n', 'dangerous species, and without any precaution whatever. The wonder\\n', 'instance of this heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in the case of\\n', 'Captain Joel Rice of the schooner Firefly, which sailed from Richmond,\\n', 'Virginia, to Madeira, with a cargo of corn, in the year 1825. The\\n', 'captain had gone many voyages without serious accident, although he was\\n', 'in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his stowage, more than\\n', 'to secure it in the ordinary manner. He had never before sailed with\\n', 'a cargo of grain, and on this occasion had the corn thrown on board\\n', 'loosely, when it did not much more than half fill the vessel. For the\\n', 'first portion of the voyage he met with nothing more than light breezes;\\n', 'but when within a day’s sail of Madeira there came on a strong gale from\\n', 'wind under a double-reefed foresail alone, when she rode as well as any\\n', 'vessel could be expected to do, and shipped not a drop of water. Toward\\n', 'night the gale somewhat abated, and she rolled with more unsteadiness\\n', 'than before, but still did very well, until a heavy lurch threw her upon\\n', 'her beam-ends to starboard. The corn was then heard to shift bodily, the\\n', 'force of the movement bursting open the main hatchway. The vessel\\n', 'went down like a shot. This happened within hail of a small sloop from\\n', 'Madeira, which picked up one of the crew (the only person saved), and\\n', 'which rode out the gale in perfect security, as indeed a jolly boat\\n', 'might have done under proper management.\\n', '\\n', 'The stowage on board the Grampus was most clumsily done, if stowage\\n', 'that could be called which was little better than a promiscuous huddling\\n', 'the condition of articles in the hold. On the orlop deck there was space\\n', 'upper deck; a space was left open around the main hatchway; and several\\n', 'other large spaces were left in the stowage. Near the hole cut through\\n', 'the bulkhead by Augustus there was room enough for an entire cask, and\\n', '\\n', 'By the time my friend had got safely into the berth, and readjusted\\n', 'his handcuffs and the rope, it was broad daylight. We had made a narrow\\n', 'escape indeed; for scarcely had he arranged all matters, when the mate\\n', 'came below, with Dirk Peters and the cook. They talked for some time\\n', 'about the vessel from the Cape Verds, and seemed to be excessively\\n', 'anxious for her appearance. At length the cook came to the berth in\\n', 'could see and hear every thing from my hiding-place, for the piece cut\\n', 'negro would fall against the pea-jacket, which was hung up to conceal\\n', 'the aperture, in which case all would have been discovered, and our\\n', 'lives would, no doubt, have been instantly sacrificed. Our good fortune\\n', 'prevailed, however; and although he frequently touched it as the vessel\\n', 'rolled, he never pressed against it sufficiently to bring about a\\n', 'discovery. The bottom of the jacket had been carefully fastened to the\\n', 'bulkhead, so that the hole might not be seen by its swinging to one\\n', 'side. All this time Tiger was lying in the foot of the berth, and\\n', 'see him occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath.\\n', '\\n', 'After a few minutes the mate and cook went above, leaving Dirk Peters\\n', 'behind, who, as soon as they were gone, came and sat himself down in\\n', 'the place just occupied by the mate. He began to talk very sociably with\\n', 'Augustus, and we could now see that the greater part of his apparent\\n', 'intoxication, while the two others were with him, was a feint. He\\n', 'answered all my companion’s questions with perfect freedom; told him\\n', 'that he had no doubt of his father’s having been picked up, as there\\n', 'were no less than five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he\\n', 'was cut adrift; and used other language of a consolatory nature,\\n', 'entertain hopes, that through the instrumentality of Peters we might\\n', 'the matter possible, but urged the necessity of the greatest caution\\n', 'in making the attempt, as the conduct of the hybrid appeared to be\\n', 'instigated by the most arbitrary caprice alone; and, indeed, it was\\n', 'difficult to say if he was at any moment of sound mind. Peters went\\n', 'upon deck in about an hour, and did not return again until noon, when he\\n', 'brought Augustus a plentiful supply of junk beef and pudding. Of this,\\n', 'the hole. No one else came down into the forecastle during the day, and\\n', 'until nearly daybreak, when he awakened me upon hearing a stir upon\\n', 'day was fully broke, we found that Tiger had recovered his strength\\n', 'almost entirely, and gave no indications of hydrophobia, drinking a\\n', 'little water that was offered him with great apparent eagerness. During\\n', 'the day he regained all his former vigour and appetite. His strange\\n', 'conduct had been brought on, no doubt, by the deleterious quality of the\\n', 'the box. This day was the thirtieth of June, and the thirteenth since\\n', 'the Grampus made sail from Nantucket.\\n', '\\n', 'On the second of July the mate came below drunk as usual, and in an\\n', 'excessively good-humor. He came to Augustus’s berth, and, giving him a\\n', 'slap on the back, asked him if he thought he could behave himself if\\n', 'he let him loose, and whether he would promise not to be going into the\\n', 'cabin again. To this, of course, my friend answered in the affirmative,\\n', 'when the ruffian set him at liberty, after making him drink from a flask\\n', 'did not see Augustus for about three hours. He then came below with the\\n', 'good news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as he\\n', 'pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast, and that he had been ordered\\n', 'to sleep, as usual, in the forecastle. He brought me, too, a good\\n', 'dinner, and a plentiful supply of water. The brig was still cruising for\\n', 'the vessel from the Cape Verds, and a sail was now in sight, which was\\n', 'thought to be the one in question. As the events of the ensuing eight\\n', 'days were of little importance, and had no direct bearing upon the main\\n', '\\n', 'contrived a comfortable bed in my hiding-place. No one came below,\\n', 'except my companion, during the day. Tiger took his station in the\\n', 'berth just by the aperture, and slept heavily, as if not yet entirely\\n', 'recovered from the effects of his sickness. Toward night a flaw of wind\\n', 'struck the brig before sail could be taken in, and very nearly capsized\\n', 'her. The puff died away immediately, however, and no damage was done\\n', 'beyond the splitting of the foretopsail. Dirk Peters treated Augustus\\n', 'all this day with great kindness and entered into a long conversation\\n', 'with him respecting the Pacific Ocean, and the islands he had visited\\n', 'in that region. He asked him whether he would not like to go with the\\n', 'mutineers on a kind of exploring and pleasure voyage in those quarters,\\n', 'and said that the men were gradually coming over to the mate’s views.\\n', 'To this Augustus thought it best to reply that he would be glad to go\\n', 'on such an adventure, since nothing better could be done, and that any\\n', 'thing was preferable to a piratical life.\\n', '\\n', 'July 4th. The vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from Liverpool,\\n', 'and was allowed to pass unmolested. Augustus spent most of his time\\n', 'on deck, with a view of obtaining all the information in his power\\n', 'respecting the intentions of the mutineers. They had frequent and\\n', 'violent quarrels among themselves, in one of which a harpooner, Jim\\n', 'Bonner, was thrown overboard. The party of the mate was gaining ground.\\n', 'Jim Bonner belonged to the cook’s gang, of which Peters was a partisan.\\n', '\\n', 'July 5th. About daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the west,\\n', 'which at noon freshened into a gale, so that the brig could carry\\n', 'nothing more than her trysail and foresail. In taking in the\\n', 'foretopsail, Simms, one of the common hands, and belonging also to\\n', 'the cook’s gang, fell overboard, being very much in liquor, and was\\n', 'drowned--no attempt being made to save him. The whole number of persons\\n', 'on board was now thirteen, to wit: Dirk Peters; Seymour, the black\\n', 'cook; Jones, Greely, Hartman Rogers and William Allen, all of the\\n', 'learned; Absalom Hicks, Wilson, John Hunty Richard Parker, of the mate’s\\n', 'party;--besides Augustus and myself.\\n', '\\n', 'July 6th. The gale lasted all this day, blowing in heavy squalls,\\n', 'accompanied with rain. The brig took in a good deal of water through her\\n', 'seams, and one of the pumps was kept continually going, Augustus being\\n', 'forced to take his turn. Just at twilight a large ship passed close\\n', 'by us, without having been discovered until within hail. The ship was\\n', 'supposed to be the one for which the mutineers were on the lookout. The\\n', 'mate hailed her, but the reply was drowned in the roaring of the gale.\\n', 'At eleven, a sea was shipped amidships, which tore away a great portion\\n', 'of the larboard bulwarks, and did some other slight damage. Toward\\n', 'morning the weather moderated, and at sunrise there was very little\\n', 'wind.\\n', '\\n', 'July 7th. There was a heavy swell running all this day, during which the\\n', 'brig, being light, rolled excessively, and many articles broke loose in\\n', 'a great deal from sea-sickness. Peters had a long conversation this day\\n', 'with Augustus, and told him that two of his gang, Greely and Allen, had\\n', 'gone over to the mate, and were resolved to turn pirates. He put several\\n', 'questions to Augustus which he did not then exactly understand. During\\n', 'a part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel; and little could\\n', \"be done to remedy it, as it was occasioned by the brig's straining, and\\n\", 'under the bows, which aided us in some measure, so that we began to gain\\n', 'upon the leak.\\n', '\\n', 'the mate headed the brig to the southwest, with the intention of making\\n', 'some of the West India islands in pursuance of his piratical designs. No\\n', 'opposition was made by Peters or the cook--at least none in the hearing\\n', 'of Augustus. All idea of taking the vessel from the Cape Verds was\\n', 'abandoned. The leak was now easily kept under by one pump going every\\n', 'three quarters of an hour. The sail was drawn from beneath the bows.\\n', 'Spoke two small schooners during the day.\\n', '\\n', 'July 9th. Fine weather. All hands employed in repairing bulwarks. Peters\\n', 'had again a long conversation with Augustus, and spoke more plainly than\\n', 'he had done heretofore. He said nothing should induce him to come into\\n', 'the mate’s views, and even hinted his intention of taking the brig out\\n', 'of his hands. He asked my friend if he could depend upon his aid in such\\n', 'case, to which Augustus said, “Yes,” without hesitation. Peters then\\n', 'said he would sound the others of his party upon the subject, and went\\n', 'away. During the remainder of the day Augustus had no opportunity of\\n', 'speaking with him privately.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'a light baffling wind from the eastward. To-day Hartman Rogers died,\\n', 'having been attacked on the eighth with spasms after drinking a glass of\\n', 'grog. This man was of the cook’s party, and one upon whom Peters placed\\n', 'his main reliance. He told Augustus that he believed the mate had\\n', 'poisoned him, and that he expected, if he did not be on the look-out,\\n', 'his own turn would come shortly. There were now only himself, Jones, and\\n', 'the cook belonging to his own gang--on the other side there were five.\\n', 'He had spoken to Jones about taking the command from the mate; but the\\n', 'project having been coolly received, he had been deterred from pressing\\n', 'the matter any further, or from saying any thing to the cook. It was\\n', 'well, as it happened, that he was so prudent, for in the afternoon the\\n', 'cook expressed his determination of siding with the mate, and went over\\n', 'formally to that party; while Jones took an opportunity of quarrelling\\n', 'with Peters, and hinted that he would let the mate know of the plan\\n', 'in agitation. There was now, evidently, no time to be lost, and Peters\\n', 'expressed his determination of attempting to take the vessel at all\\n', 'hazards, provided Augustus would lend him his aid. My friend at once\\n', 'assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that purpose,\\n', 'and, thinking the opportunity a favourable one, made known the fact\\n', 'of my being on board. At this the hybrid was not more astonished than\\n', 'delighted, as he had no reliance whatever upon Jones, whom he already\\n', 'considered as belonging to the party of the mate. They went below\\n', 'immediately, when Augustus called to me by name, and Peters and myself\\n', 'were soon made acquainted. It was agreed that we should attempt to\\n', 'retake the vessel upon the first good opportunity, leaving Jones\\n', 'altogether out of our councils. In the event of success, we were to\\n', 'run the brig into the first port that offered, and deliver her up. The\\n', 'desertion of his party had frustrated Peters’ design of going into the\\n', 'Pacific--an adventure which could not be accomplished without a crew,\\n', 'and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial, on the score\\n', 'of insanity (which he solemnly avowed had actuated him in lending his\\n', 'aid to the mutiny), or upon obtaining a pardon, if found guilty, through\\n', 'the representations of Augustus and myself. Our deliberations were\\n', 'interrupted for the present by the cry of, “All hands take in sail,” and\\n', 'Peters and Augustus ran up on deck.\\n', '\\n', 'As usual, the crew were nearly all drunk; and, before sail could be\\n', 'properly taken in, a violent squall laid the brig on her beam-ends. By\\n', 'keeping her away, however, she righted, having shipped a good deal of\\n', 'water. Scarcely was everything secure, when another squall took the\\n', 'vessel, and immediately afterward another--no damage being done. There\\n', 'was every appearance of a gale of wind, which, indeed, shortly came on,\\n', 'with great fury, from the northward and westward. All was made as snug\\n', 'as possible, and we laid-to, as usual, under a close-reefed foresail. As\\n', 'night drew on, the wind increased in violence, with a remarkably heavy\\n', 'sea. Peters now came into the forecastle with Augustus, and we resumed\\n', 'our deliberations.\\n', '\\n', 'We agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the present\\n', 'for carrying our designs into effect, as an attempt at such a moment\\n', 'would never be anticipated. As the brig was snugly laid-to, there would\\n', 'be no necessity of manoeuvring her until good weather, when, if we\\n', 'succeeded in our attempt, we might liberate one, or perhaps two of the\\n', 'men, to aid us in taking her into port. The main difficulty was the\\n', 'great disproportion in our forces. There were only three of us, and in\\n', 'the cabin there were nine. All the arms on board, too, were in their\\n', 'possession, with the exception of a pair of small pistols which Peters\\n', 'had concealed about his person, and the large seaman’s knife which\\n', 'he always wore in the waistband of his pantaloons. From certain\\n', 'indications, too--such, for example, as there being no such thing as\\n', 'an axe or a handspike lying in their customary places--we began to fear\\n', 'that the mate had his suspicions, at least in regard to Peters, and that\\n', 'he would let slip no opportunity of getting rid of him. It was clear,\\n', 'indeed, that what we should determine to do could not be done too soon.\\n', 'Still the odds were too much against us to allow of our proceeding\\n', 'without the greatest caution.\\n', '\\n', 'Peters proposed that he should go up on deck, and enter into\\n', 'conversation with the watch (Allen), when he would be able to throw him\\n', 'into the sea without trouble, and without making any disturbance, by\\n', 'seizing a good opportunity, that Augustus and myself should then come\\n', 'up, and endeavour to provide ourselves with some kind of weapons from\\n', 'the deck, and that we should then make a rush together, and secure the\\n', 'fellow in all matters which did not affect his superstitious prejudices)\\n', 'would suffer himself to be so easily entrapped. The very fact of there\\n', 'being a watch on deck at all was sufficient proof that he was upon the\\n', 'alert,--it not being usual except in vessels where discipline is most\\n', 'rigidly enforced, to station a watch on deck when a vessel is lying-to\\n', 'to persons who have never been to sea, it may be as well to state the\\n', 'exact condition of a vessel under such circumstances. Lying-to, or,\\n', 'in sea-parlance, “laying-to,” is a measure resorted to for various\\n', 'purposes, and effected in various manners. In moderate weather it\\n', 'is frequently done with a view of merely bringing the vessel to a\\n', 'stand-still, to wait for another vessel or any similar object. If\\n', 'the vessel which lies-to is under full sail, the manoeuvre is usually\\n', 'accomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails, so as to let\\n', 'the wind take them aback, when she becomes stationary. But we are now\\n', 'speaking of lying-to in a gale of wind. This is done when the wind\\n', 'is ahead, and too violent to admit of carrying sail without danger of\\n', 'capsizing; and sometimes even when the wind is fair, but the sea too\\n', 'heavy for the vessel to be put before it. If a vessel be suffered to\\n', 'scud before the wind in a very heavy sea, much damage is usually done\\n', 'her by the shipping of water over her stern, and sometimes by the\\n', 'violent plunges she makes forward. This manoeuvre, then, is seldom\\n', 'resorted to in such case, unless through necessity. When the vessel\\n', 'is in a leaky condition she is often put before the wind even in the\\n', 'heaviest seas; for, when lying-to, her seams are sure to be greatly\\n', 'opened by her violent straining, and it is not so much the case when\\n', 'scudding. Often, too, it becomes necessary to scud a vessel, either when\\n', 'the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in pieces the sail which\\n', 'is employed with a view of bringing her head to the wind, or when,\\n', 'through the false modelling of the frame or other causes, this main\\n', 'object cannot be effected.\\n', '\\n', 'Vessels in a gale of wind are laid-to in different manners, according\\n', 'to their peculiar construction. Some lie-to best under a foresail, and\\n', 'vessels have sails for the express purpose, called storm-staysails.\\n', 'But the jib is occasionally employed by itself,--sometimes the jib\\n', 'and foresail, or a double-reefed foresail, and not unfrequently the\\n', 'after-sails, are made use of. Foretopsails are very often found to\\n', 'answer the purpose better than any other species of sail. The Grampus\\n', 'was generally laid-to under a close-reefed foresail.\\n', '\\n', 'When a vessel is to be laid-to, her head is brought up to the wind just\\n', 'so nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies when hauled flat aft,\\n', 'that is, when brought diagonally across the vessel. This being done,\\n', 'the bows point within a few degrees of the direction from which the wind\\n', 'issues, and the windward bow of course receives the shock of the waves.\\n', 'In this situation a good vessel will ride out a very heavy gale of wind\\n', 'without shipping a drop of water, and without any further attention\\n', 'being requisite on the part of the crew. The helm is usually lashed\\n', 'down, but this is altogether unnecessary (except on account of the noise\\n', 'it makes when loose), for the rudder has no effect upon the vessel when\\n', 'lying-to. Indeed, the helm had far better be left loose than lashed very\\n', 'fast, for the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy seas if there be no\\n', 'room for the helm to play. As long as the sail holds, a well modelled\\n', 'vessel will maintain her situation, and ride every sea, as if instinct\\n', 'with life and reason. If the violence of the wind, however, should tear\\n', 'the sail into pieces (a feat which it requires a perfect hurricane to\\n', 'accomplish under ordinary circumstances), there is then imminent danger.\\n', 'The vessel falls off from the wind, and, coming broadside to the sea,\\n', 'is completely at its mercy: the only resource in this case is to put her\\n', 'quietly before the wind, letting her scud until some other sail can be\\n', 'set. Some vessels will lie-to under no sail whatever, but such are not\\n', 'to be trusted at sea.\\n', '\\n', 'But to return from this digression. It had never been customary with the\\n', 'mate to have any watch on deck when lying-to in a gale of wind, and the\\n', 'fact that he had now one, coupled with the circumstance of the missing\\n', 'axes and handspikes, fully convinced us that the crew were too well on\\n', 'the watch to be taken by surprise in the manner Peters had suggested.\\n', 'Something, however, was to be done, and that with as little delay as\\n', 'practicable, for there could be no doubt that a suspicion having\\n', 'been once entertained against Peters, he would be sacrificed upon the\\n', 'earliest occasion, and one would certainly be either found or made upon\\n', 'the breaking of the gale.\\n', '\\n', 'Augustus now suggested that if Peters could contrive to remove, under\\n', 'any pretext, the piece of chain-cable which lay over the trap in the\\n', 'stateroom, we might possibly be able to come upon them unawares by means\\n', 'of the hold; but a little reflection convinced us that the vessel rolled\\n', 'and pitched too violently for any attempt of that nature.\\n', '\\n', 'superstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate. It will be\\n', 'remembered that one of the crew, Hartman Rogers, had died during the\\n', 'morning, having been attacked two days before with spasms after drinking\\n', 'some spirits and water. Peters had expressed to us his opinion that this\\n', 'man had been poisoned by the mate, and for this belief he had reasons,\\n', 'so he said, which were incontrovertible, but which he could not be\\n', 'prevailed upon to explain to us--this wayward refusal being only in\\n', 'keeping with other points of his singular character. But whether or not\\n', 'he had any better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had ourselves,\\n', 'we were easily led to fall in with his suspicion, and determined to act\\n', 'accordingly.\\n', '\\n', 'Rogers had died about eleven in the forenoon, in violent convulsions;\\n', 'and the corpse presented in a few minutes after death one of the most\\n', 'stomach was swollen immensely, like that of a man who has been drowned\\n', 'and lain under water for many weeks. The hands were in the same\\n', 'condition, while the face was shrunken, shrivelled, and of a chalky\\n', 'whiteness, except where relieved by two or three glaring red blotches\\n', 'like those occasioned by the erysipelas: one of these blotches extended\\n', 'diagonally across the face, completely covering up an eye as if with\\n', 'a band of red velvet. In this disgusting condition the body had been\\n', 'brought up from the cabin at noon to be thrown overboard, when the mate\\n', 'getting a glimpse of it (for he now saw it for the first time), and\\n', 'being either touched with remorse for his crime or struck with terror at\\n', 'so horrible a sight, ordered the men to sew the body up in its\\n', 'hammock, and allow it the usual rites of sea-burial. Having given these\\n', 'directions, he went below, as if to avoid any further sight of his\\n', 'victim. While preparations were making to obey his orders, the gale came\\n', 'on with great fury, and the design was abandoned for the present. The\\n', 'corpse, left to itself, was washed into the larboard scuppers, where\\n', 'furious lurches of the brig.\\n', '\\n', 'Having arranged our plan, we set about putting it in execution as\\n', 'speedily as possible. Peters went upon deck, and, as he had anticipated,\\n', 'was immediately accosted by Allen, who appeared to be stationed more as\\n', 'a watch upon the forecastle than for any other purpose. The fate of\\n', 'this villain, however, was speedily and silently decided; for Peters,\\n', 'approaching him in a careless manner, as if about to address him, seized\\n', 'him by the throat, and, before he could utter a single cry, tossed\\n', 'him over the bulwarks. He then called to us, and we came up. Our first\\n', 'precaution was to look about for something with which to arm ourselves,\\n', 'and in doing this we had to proceed with great care, for it was\\n', 'impossible to stand on deck an instant without holding fast, and\\n', 'violent seas broke over the vessel at every plunge forward. It was\\n', 'indispensable, too, that we should be quick in our operations, for every\\n', 'minute we expected the mate to be up to set the pumps going, as it was\\n', 'evident the brig must be taking in water very fast. After searching\\n', 'about for some time, we could find nothing more fit for our purpose\\n', 'Having secured these, we stripped off the shirt of the corpse and\\n', 'dropped the body overboard. Peters and myself then went below, leaving\\n', 'Augustus to watch upon deck, where he took his station just where Allen\\n', 'had been placed, and with his back to the cabin companionway, so that,\\n', \"if any of the mate's gang should come up, he might suppose it was the\\n\", 'watch.\\n', '\\n', 'the corpse of Rogers. The shirt which we had taken from the body aided\\n', 'us very much, for it was of singular form and character, and easily\\n', 'recognizable--a kind of smock, which the deceased wore over his other\\n', 'clothing. It was a blue stockinett, with large white stripes running\\n', 'stomach, in imitation of the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse.\\n', 'then gave the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white\\n', 'woollen mittens, and filling them in with any kind of rags that offered\\n', 'themselves. Peters then arranged my face, first rubbing it well over\\n', 'with white chalk, and afterward blotching it with blood, which he took\\n', 'from a cut in his finger. The streak across the eye was not forgotten\\n', 'and presented a most shocking appearance.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'so impressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance, and at the\\n', 'resolution to go on with my part. It was necessary, however, to act with\\n', 'decision, and Peters and myself went upon deck.\\n', '\\n', 'We there found everything safe, and, keeping close to the bulwarks,\\n', 'the three of us crept to the cabin companion-way. It was only partially\\n', 'closed, precautions having been taken to prevent its being suddenly\\n', 'pushed to from without, by means of placing billets of wood on the upper\\n', 'step so as to interfere with the shutting. We found no difficulty in\\n', 'getting a full view of the interior of the cabin through the cracks\\n', 'where the hinges were placed. It now proved to have been very fortunate\\n', 'for us that we had not attempted to take them by surprise, for they were\\n', 'evidently on the alert. Only one was asleep, and he lying just at the\\n', 'foot of the companion-ladder, with a musket by his side. The rest were\\n', 'seated on several mattresses, which had been taken from the berths and\\n', 'thrown on the floor. They were engaged in earnest conversation; and\\n', 'although they had been carousing, as appeared from two empty jugs, with\\n', 'some tin tumblers which lay about, they were not as much intoxicated\\n', 'as usual. All had knives, one or two of them pistols, and a great many\\n', 'muskets were lying in a berth close at hand.\\n', '\\n', 'We listened to their conversation for some time before we could make\\n', 'up our minds how to act, having as yet resolved on nothing determinate,\\n', 'except that we would attempt to paralyze their exertions, when we should\\n', 'attack them, by means of the apparition of Rogers. They were discussing\\n', 'their piratical plans, in which all we could hear distinctly was, that\\n', 'they would unite with the crew of a schooner _Hornet_, and, if possible,\\n', 'get the schooner herself into their possession preparatory to some\\n', 'attempt on a large scale, the particulars of which could not be made out\\n', 'by either of us.\\n', '\\n', 'One of the men spoke of Peters, when the mate replied to him in a low\\n', 'voice which could not be distinguished, and afterward added more\\n', 'loudly, that “he could not understand his being so much forward with the\\n', 'captain’s brat in the forecastle, and he thought the sooner both of them\\n', 'were overboard the better.” To this no answer was made, but we could\\n', 'easily perceive that the hint was well received by the whole party, and\\n', 'dearly as possible, and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any\\n', 'feelings of trepidation.\\n', '\\n', 'The tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the rigging, and\\n', 'the washing of the sea over the deck, prevented us from hearing what was\\n', 'said, except during momentary lulls. In one of these, we all distinctly\\n', 'heard the mate tell one of the men to “go forward, have an eye upon\\n', 'them, for he wanted no such secret doings on board the brig.” It was\\n', 'well for us that the pitching of the vessel at this moment was so\\n', 'violent as to prevent this order from being carried into instant\\n', 'execution. The cook got up from his mattress to go for us, when a\\n', 'headlong against one of the larboard stateroom doors, bursting it open,\\n', 'and creating a good deal of other confusion. Luckily, neither of\\n', 'our party was thrown from his position, and we had time to make a\\n', 'precipitate retreat to the forecastle, and arrange a hurried plan of\\n', 'action before the messenger made his appearance, or rather before he put\\n', 'his head out of the companion-hatch, for he did not come on deck.\\n', 'From this station he could not notice the absence of Allen, and he\\n', 'accordingly bawled out, as if to him, repeating the orders of the\\n', 'mate. Peters cried out, “Ay, ay,” in a disguised voice, and the cook\\n', 'immediately went below, without entertaining a suspicion that all was\\n', 'not right.\\n', '\\n', 'My two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the cabin,\\n', 'Peters closing the door after him in the same manner he had found it.\\n', 'The mate received them with feigned cordiality, and told Augustus that,\\n', 'since he had behaved himself so well of late, he might take up his\\n', 'quarters in the cabin and be one of them for the future. He then poured\\n', 'companion-way, to be ready for use when required.\\n', '\\n', 'all that was passing within, and endeavoured to nerve myself to the task\\n', 'of descending among the mutineers when Peters should make a signal to\\n', 'me, as agreed upon. Presently he contrived to turn the conversation upon\\n', 'the bloody deeds of the mutiny, and by degrees led the men to talk\\n', 'of the thousand superstitions which are so universally current among\\n', 'the effects of the conversation in the countenances of those present.\\n', 'The mate was evidently much agitated, and presently, when some one\\n', 'upon the point of swooning. Peters now asked him if he did not think it\\n', 'would be better to have the body thrown overboard at once as it was too\\n', 'horrible a sight to see it floundering about in the scuppers. At this\\n', 'the villain absolutely gasped for breath, and turned his head slowly\\n', 'round upon his companions, as if imploring some one to go up and perform\\n', 'the task. No one, however, stirred, and it was quite evident that the\\n', 'whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of nervous excitement.\\n', 'companion-way, and, descending, without uttering a syllable, stood erect\\n', 'in the midst of the party.\\n', '\\n', 'The intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at all\\n', 'to be wondered at when the various circumstances are taken into\\n', 'consideration. Usually, in cases of a similar nature, there is left in\\n', 'the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as to the reality of\\n', 'the vision before his eyes; a degree of hope, however feeble, that he\\n', 'is the victim of chicanery, and that the apparition is not actually a\\n', 'visitant from the old world of shadows. It is not too much to say that\\n', 'such remnants of doubt have been at the bottom of almost every such\\n', 'visitation, and that the appalling horror which has sometimes been\\n', 'brought about, is to be attributed, even in the cases most in point,\\n', 'and where most suffering has been experienced, more to a kind of\\n', 'anticipative horror, lest the apparition might possibly be real, than\\n', 'to an unwavering belief in its reality. But, in the present instance, it\\n', 'will be seen immediately, that in the minds of the mutineers there\\n', 'was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a doubt that\\n', 'the apparition of Rogers was indeed a revivification of his disgusting\\n', 'corpse, or at least its spiritual image. The isolated situation of the\\n', 'brig, with its entire inaccessibility on account of the gale, confined\\n', 'the apparently possible means of deception within such narrow and\\n', 'definite limits, that they must have thought themselves enabled to\\n', 'survey them all at a glance. They had now been at sea twenty-four days,\\n', 'without holding more than a speaking communication with any vessel\\n', 'whatever. The whole of the crew, too--at least all whom they had the\\n', 'most remote reason for suspecting to be on board--were assembled in the\\n', 'cabin, with the exception of Allen, the watch; and his gigantic stature\\n', '(he was six feet six inches high) was too familiar in their eyes to\\n', 'permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to enter their\\n', 'minds even for an instant. Add to these considerations the awe-inspiring\\n', 'nature of the tempest, and that of the conversation brought about by\\n', 'Peters; the deep impression which the loathsomeness of the actual corpse\\n', 'had made in the morning upon the imaginations of the men; the excellence\\n', 'of the imitation in my person, and the uncertain and wavering light\\n', 'in which they beheld me, as the glare of the cabin lantern, swinging\\n', 'violently to and fro, fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure, and\\n', 'there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even more than\\n', 'the entire effect which we had anticipated. The mate sprang up from the\\n', 'mattress on which he was lying, and, without uttering a syllable, fell\\n', 'back, stone dead, upon the cabin floor, and was hurled to the leeward\\n', 'like a log by a heavy roll of the brig. Of the remaining seven, there\\n', 'were but three who had at first any degree of presence of mind. The\\n', 'four others sat for some time rooted apparently to the floor, the most\\n', 'pitiable objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered.\\n', 'The only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook, John Hunt,\\n', 'and Richard Parker; but they made but a feeble and irresolute defence.\\n', 'the meantime, Augustus seized one of the muskets lying on the floor\\n', 'and shot another mutineer Wilson through the breast. There were now but\\n', 'three remaining; but by this time they had become aroused from their\\n', 'lethargy, and perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised\\n', 'upon them, for they fought with great resolution and fury, and, but for\\n', 'the immense muscular strength of Peters, might have ultimately got the\\n', 'better of us. These three men were--Jones, Greely, and Absolom Hicks.\\n', 'Jones had thrown Augustus to the floor, stabbed him in several places\\n', 'along the right arm, and would no doubt have soon dispatched him\\n', '(as neither Peters nor myself could immediately get rid of our own\\n', 'antagonists), had it not been for the timely aid of a friend, upon whose\\n', 'assistance we, surely, had never depended. This friend was no other than\\n', 'Tiger. With a low growl, he bounded into the cabin, at a most critical\\n', 'moment for Augustus, and throwing himself upon Jones, pinned him to the\\n', 'floor in an instant. My friend, however, was now too much injured to\\n', 'throat of Jones--Peters, nevertheless, was far more than a match for the\\n', 'two men who remained, and would, no doubt, have dispatched them sooner,\\n', 'had it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act, and the\\n', 'tremendous lurches of the vessel. Presently he was enabled to get hold\\n', 'of a heavy stool, several of which lay about the floor. With this he\\n', 'beat out the brains of Greely as he was in the act of discharging a\\n', 'musket at me, and immediately afterward a roll of the brig throwing\\n', 'him in contact with Hicks, he seized him by the throat, and, by dint of\\n', 'sheer strength, strangled him instantaneously. Thus, in far less time\\n', '\\n', 'The only person of our opponents who was left alive was Richard Parker.\\n', 'pump-handle at the commencement of the attack. He now lay motionless by\\n', 'the door of the shattered stateroom; but, upon Peters touching him with\\n', 'his foot, he spoke, and entreated for mercy. His head was only slightly\\n', 'cut, and otherwise he had received no injury, having been merely stunned\\n', 'by the blow. He now got up, and, for the present, we secured his hands\\n', 'behind his back. The dog was still growling over Jones; but, upon\\n', 'examination, we found him completely dead, the blood issuing in a stream\\n', 'from a deep wound in the throat, inflicted, no doubt, by the sharp teeth\\n', 'of the animal.\\n', '\\n', 'It was now about one o’clock in the morning, and the wind was still\\n', 'blowing tremendously. The brig evidently laboured much more than usual,\\n', 'and it became absolutely necessary that something should be done with a\\n', 'view of easing her in some measure. At almost every roll to leeward\\n', 'she shipped a sea, several of which came partially down into the cabin\\n', 'descended. The entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away,\\n', 'as well as the caboose, together with the jollyboat from the counter.\\n', 'The creaking and working of the mainmast, too, gave indication that it\\n', 'was nearly sprung. To make room for more stowage in the afterhold, the\\n', 'heel of this mast had been stepped between decks (a very reprehensible\\n', 'practice, occasionally resorted to by ignorant ship-builders), so that\\n', 'it was in imminent danger of working from its step. But, to crown all\\n', 'our difficulties, we plummed the well, and found no less than seven feet\\n', 'of water.\\n', '\\n', 'Leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin, we got to work\\n', 'immediately at the pumps--Parker, of course, being set at liberty to\\n', 'assist us in the labour. Augustus’s arm was bound up as well as we could\\n', 'effect it, and he did what he could, but that was not much. However, we\\n', 'found that we could just manage to keep the leak from gaining upon us\\n', 'by having one pump constantly going. As there were only four of us, this\\n', 'was severe labour; but we endeavoured to keep up our spirits, and looked\\n', 'anxiously for daybreak, when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting\\n', 'away the mainmast.\\n', '\\n', 'In this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue, and,\\n', 'when the day at length broke, the gale had neither abated in the least,\\n', 'nor were there any signs of its abating. We now dragged the bodies\\n', 'on deck and threw them overboard. Our next care was to get rid of the\\n', 'mainmast. The necessary preparations having been made, Peters cut away\\n', 'at the mast (having found axes in the cabin), while the rest of us stood\\n', 'by the stays and lanyards. As the brig gave a tremendous lee-lurch, the\\n', 'word was given to cut away the weather-lanyards, which being done, the\\n', 'whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea, clear of the brig,\\n', 'and without doing any material injury. We now found that the vessel\\n', 'did not labour quite as much as before, but our situation was still\\n', 'exceedingly precarious, and in spite of the utmost exertions, we\\n', 'could not gain upon the leak without the aid of both pumps. The\\n', 'little assistance which Augustus could render us was not really of any\\n', 'importance. To add to our distress, a heavy sea, striking the brig to\\n', 'the windward, threw her off several points from the wind, and, before\\n', 'she could regain her position, another broke completely over her, and\\n', 'hurled her full upon her beam-ends. The ballast now shifted in a mass\\n', 'to leeward (the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at random for\\n', 'some time), and for a few moments we thought nothing could save us from\\n', 'capsizing. Presently, however, we partially righted; but the ballast\\n', 'still retaining its place to larboard, we lay so much along that it was\\n', 'useless to think of working the pumps, which indeed we could not have\\n', 'done much longer in any case, as our hands were entirely raw with\\n', 'the excessive labour we had undergone, and were bleeding in the most\\n', 'horrible manner.\\n', '\\n', 'Contrary to Parker’s advice, we now proceeded to cut away the foremast,\\n', 'and at length accomplished it after much difficulty, owing to the\\n', 'position in which we lay. In going overboard the wreck took with it the\\n', 'bowsprit, and left us a complete hulk.\\n', '\\n', 'So far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our longboat,\\n', 'which had received no damage from any of the huge seas which had come on\\n', 'board. But we had not long to congratulate ourselves; for the foremast\\n', 'having gone, and, of course, the foresail with it, by which the brig had\\n', 'been steadied, every sea now made a complete breach over us, and in\\n', 'five minutes our deck was swept from stem to stern, the longboat\\n', 'and starboard bulwarks torn off, and even the windlass shattered into\\n', 'fragments. It was, indeed, hardly possible for us to be in a more\\n', 'pitiable condition.\\n', '\\n', 'At noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gale’s abating,\\n', 'but in this we were sadly disappointed, for it only lulled for a few\\n', 'minutes to blow with redoubled fury. About four in the afternoon it was\\n', 'utterly impossible to stand up against the violence of the blast; and,\\n', 'vessel would hold together until morning.\\n', '\\n', 'By midnight we had settled very deep in the water, which was now up to\\n', 'the orlop deck. The rudder went soon afterward, the sea which tore it\\n', 'away lifting the after portion of the brig entirely from the water,\\n', 'against which she thumped in her descent with such a concussion as would\\n', 'be occasioned by going ashore. We had all calculated that the rudder\\n', 'would hold its own to the last, as it was unusually strong, being rigged\\n', 'timber there ran a succession of stout iron hooks, and others in the\\n', 'same manner down the stern-post. Through these hooks there extended\\n', 'a very thick wrought-iron rod, the rudder being thus held to the\\n', 'stern-post and swinging freely on the rod. The tremendous force of the\\n', 'sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact, that the hooks in\\n', 'the stern-post, which ran entirely through it, being clinched on the\\n', 'inside, were drawn every one of them completely out of the solid wood.\\n', '\\n', 'We had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this shock,\\n', 'on board of us, sweeping the companion-way clear off, bursting in the\\n', 'hatchways, and filling every inch of the vessel with water.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'to the fragments of the windlass, lying in this manner as flat upon the\\n', 'deck as possible. This precaution alone saved us from destruction. As\\n', 'it was, we were all more or less stunned by the immense weight of water\\n', 'which tumbled upon us, and which did not roll from above us until we\\n', 'to my companions. Augustus alone replied, saying: “It is all over with\\n', 'us, and may God have mercy upon our souls!” By-and-by both the others\\n', 'were enabled to speak, when they exhorted us to take courage, as there\\n', 'was still hope; it being impossible, from the nature of the cargo, that\\n', 'the brig could go down, and there being every chance that the gale would\\n', 'blow over by the morning. These words inspired me with new life; for,\\n', 'strange as it may seem, although it was obvious that a vessel with a\\n', 'in mind as to have overlooked this consideration altogether; and the\\n', 'opportunity to strengthen the lashings which held me to the remains\\n', 'companions were also busy. The night was as dark as it could possibly\\n', 'be, and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which surrounded us it\\n', 'is useless to attempt describing. Our deck lay level with the sea, or\\n', 'rather we were encircled with a towering ridge of foam, a portion of\\n', 'which swept over us every instant. It is not too much to say that our\\n', 'heads were not fairly out of the water more than one second in three.\\n', 'Although we lay close together, no one of us could see the other,\\n', 'or, indeed, any portion of the brig itself, upon which we were so\\n', 'tempestuously hurled about. At intervals we called one to the other,\\n', 'thus endeavouring to keep alive hope, and render consolation and\\n', 'encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it. The feeble\\n', 'condition of Augustus made him an object of solicitude with us all; and\\n', 'as, from the lacerated condition of his right arm, it must have been\\n', 'impossible for him to secure his lashings with any degree of\\n', 'firmness, we were in momentary expectation of finding that he had gone\\n', 'overboard--yet to render him aid was a thing altogether out of the\\n', 'question. Fortunately, his station was more secure than that of any\\n', 'of the rest of us; for the upper part of his body lying just beneath\\n', 'a portion of the shattered windlass, the seas, as they tumbled in upon\\n', 'him, were greatly broken in their violence. In any other situation than\\n', 'this (into which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed\\n', 'himself in a very exposed spot) he must inevitably have perished before\\n', 'morning. Owing to the brig’s lying so much along, we were all less\\n', 'liable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the case. The\\n', 'deck being constantly under water. The seas, therefore, which struck us\\n', 'to starboard were much broken, by the vessel’s side, only reaching us\\n', 'in fragments as we lay flat on our faces; while those which came from\\n', 'larboard being what are called back-water seas, and obtaining little\\n', 'hold upon us on account of our posture, had not sufficient force to drag\\n', 'us from our fastenings.\\n', '\\n', 'In this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to show\\n', 'us more fully the horrors which surrounded us. The brig was a mere\\n', 'log, rolling about at the mercy of every wave; the gale was upon the\\n', 'increase, if any thing, blowing indeed a complete hurricane, and there\\n', 'appeared to us no earthly prospect of deliverance. For several hours\\n', 'we held on in silence, expecting every moment that our lashings would\\n', 'either give way, that the remains of the windlass would go by the board,\\n', 'or that some of the huge seas, which roared in every direction around\\n', 'us and above us, would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we\\n', 'should be drowned before it could regain the surface. By the mercy of\\n', 'God, however, we were preserved from these imminent dangers, and about\\n', 'midday were cheered by the light of the blessed sun. Shortly afterward\\n', 'we could perceive a sensible diminution in the force of the wind, when,\\n', 'now for the first time since the latter part of the evening before,\\n', 'Augustus spoke, asking Peters, who lay closest to him, if he thought\\n', 'there was any possibility of our being saved. As no reply was at first\\n', 'made to this question, we all concluded that the hybrid had been drowned\\n', 'where he lay; but presently, to our great joy, he spoke, although very\\n', 'feebly, saying that he was in great pain, being so cut by the tightness\\n', 'of his lashings across the stomach, that he must either find means of\\n', 'loosening them or perish, as it was impossible that he could endure\\n', 'his misery much longer. This occasioned us great distress, as it was\\n', 'altogether useless to think of aiding him in any manner while the\\n', 'sea continued washing over us as it did. We exhorted him to bear his\\n', 'sufferings with fortitude, and promised to seize the first opportunity\\n', 'which should offer itself to relieve him. He replied that it would soon\\n', 'be too late; that it would be all over with him before we could help\\n', 'him; and then, after moaning for some minutes, lay silent, when we\\n', 'concluded that he had perished.\\n', '\\n', 'As the evening drew on, the sea had fallen so much that scarcely more\\n', 'than one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the course of five\\n', 'minutes, and the wind had abated a great deal, although still blowing a\\n', 'now called to Augustus. He replied, although very feebly, so that\\n', 'Parker, neither of whom returned any answer.\\n', '\\n', 'during which the most pleasing images floated in my imagination; such as\\n', 'green trees, waving meadows of ripe grain, processions of dancing girls,\\n', 'which passed before my mind’s eye, motion was a predominant idea. Thus,\\n', 'any thing of that kind; but windmills, ships, large birds, balloons,\\n', 'people on horseback, carriages driving furiously, and similar moving\\n', 'circumstances connected with my situation, and for some time remained\\n', 'and that the body of Parker was that of Tiger.\\n', '\\n', 'blew no more than a moderate breeze, and that the sea was comparatively\\n', 'calm; so much so that it only washed over the brig amidships. My left\\n', 'arm had broken loose from its lashings, and was much cut about the\\n', 'elbow; my right was entirely benumbed, and the hand and wrist swollen\\n', 'prodigiously by the pressure of the rope, which had worked from the\\n', 'went about my waist, and had been drawn to an insufferable degree of\\n', 'lived, although a thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as\\n', 'made a feeble motion to me with his hand, pointing to the rope. Augustus\\n', 'gave no indication of life whatever, and was bent nearly double across a\\n', 'splinter of the windlass. Parker spoke to me when he saw me moving,\\n', 'contrive to untie him, we might yet save our lives; but that otherwise\\n', 'and, after several ineffectual attempts, at length succeeded in opening\\n', 'fastenings, and afterward cut the other ropes which held me. Upon\\n', 'move my right arm in any direction. Upon mentioning this to Parker, he\\n', 'advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes, holding on to the windlass\\n', 'with my left hand, so as to allow time for the blood to circulate. Doing\\n', 'caution toward Parker, without getting on my legs, and soon cut loose\\n', 'all the lashings about him, when, after a short delay, he also recovered\\n', 'the partial use of his limbs. We now lost no time in getting loose the\\n', 'rope from Peters. It had cut a deep gash through the waistband of his\\n', 'woollen pantaloons, and through two shirts, and made its way into his\\n', 'groin, from which the blood flowed out copiously as we removed the\\n', 'cordage. No sooner had we removed it, however, than he spoke, and seemed\\n', 'to experience instant relief--being able to move with much greater ease\\n', 'than either Parker or myself--this was no doubt owing to the discharge\\n', 'of blood.\\n', '\\n', 'We had little hopes that Augustus would recover, as he evinced no signs\\n', 'of life; but, upon getting to him, we discovered that he had merely\\n', 'swooned from the loss of blood, the bandages we had placed around his\\n', 'wounded arm having been torn off by the water; none of the ropes which\\n', 'held him to the windlass were drawn sufficiently tight to occasion his\\n', 'death. Having relieved him from the fastenings, and got him clear of\\n', 'the broken wood about the windlass, we secured him in a dry place to\\n', 'windward, with his head somewhat lower than his body, and all three of\\n', 'us busied ourselves in chafing his limbs. In about half an hour he came\\n', 'to himself, although it was not until the next morning that he gave\\n', 'signs of recognizing any of us, or had sufficient strength to speak. By\\n', 'the time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was quite dark, and it\\n', 'began to cloud up, so that we were again in the greatest agony lest it\\n', 'should come on to blow hard, in which event nothing could have saved us\\n', 'from perishing, exhausted as we were. By good fortune it continued very\\n', 'moderate during the night, the sea subsiding every minute, which gave\\n', 'carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from slipping\\n', 'overboard with the rolls of the vessel, as he was still too weak to\\n', 'hold on at all. For ourselves there was no such necessity. We sat close\\n', 'together, supporting each other with the aid of the broken ropes\\n', 'about the windlass, and devising methods of escape from our frightful\\n', 'situation. We derived much comfort from taking off our clothes and\\n', 'wringing the water from them. When we put them on after this, they felt\\n', 'remarkably warm and pleasant, and served to invigorate us in no little\\n', 'degree. We helped Augustus off with his, and wrung them for him, when he\\n', 'experienced the same comfort.\\n', '\\n', 'Our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst, and when we\\n', 'looked forward to the means of relief in this respect, our hearts sunk\\n', 'within us, and we were induced to regret that we had escaped the\\n', 'less dreadful perils of the sea. We endeavoured, however, to console\\n', 'ourselves with the hope of being speedily picked up by some vessel\\n', 'and encouraged each other to bear with fortitude the evils that might\\n', 'happen.\\n', '\\n', 'The morning of the fourteenth at length dawned, and the weather still\\n', 'continued clear and pleasant, with a steady but very light breeze from\\n', 'could not determine, the brig did not lie so much along as she had done\\n', 'before, the deck was comparatively dry, and we could move about with\\n', 'freedom. We had now been better than three entire days and nights\\n', 'without either food or drink, and it became absolutely necessary that we\\n', 'should make an attempt to get up something from below. As the brig was\\n', 'completely full of water, we went to this work despondently, and with\\n', 'but little expectation of being able to obtain anything. We made a kind\\n', 'of drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains of the\\n', 'companion-hatch into two pieces of wood. Tying these across each other,\\n', 'and fastening them to the end of a rope, we threw them into the cabin,\\n', 'and dragged them to and fro, in the faint hope of being thus able to\\n', 'entangle some article which might be of use to us for food, or which\\n', 'might at least render us assistance in getting it. We spent the greater\\n', 'part of the morning in this labour without effect, fishing up nothing\\n', 'more than a few bedclothes, which were readily caught by the nails.\\n', 'Indeed, our contrivance was so very clumsy that any greater success was\\n', 'hardly to be anticipated.\\n', '\\n', 'We now tried the forecastle, but equally in vain, and were upon the\\n', 'brink of despair, when Peters proposed that we should fasten a rope to\\n', 'his body, and let him make an attempt to get up something by diving\\n', 'into the cabin. This proposition we hailed with all the delight which\\n', 'reviving hope could inspire. He proceeded immediately to strip off his\\n', 'clothes with the exception of his pantaloons; and a strong rope was\\n', 'then carefully fastened around his middle, being brought up over\\n', 'his shoulders in such a manner that there was no possibility of its\\n', 'slipping. The undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger; for,\\n', 'as we could hardly expect to find much, if any, provision in the cabin\\n', 'itself, it was necessary that the diver, after letting himself down,\\n', 'should make a turn to the right, and proceed under water a distance of\\n', 'ten or twelve feet, in a narrow passage, to the storeroom, and return,\\n', 'without drawing breath.\\n', '\\n', 'Everything being ready, Peters now descended in the cabin, going down\\n', 'the companion-ladder until the water reached his chin. He then plunged\\n', 'in, head first, turning to the right as he plunged, and endeavouring to\\n', 'make his way to the storeroom. In this first attempt, however, he was\\n', 'altogether unsuccessful. In less than half a minute after his going down\\n', 'we felt the rope jerked violently (the signal we had agreed upon when\\n', 'he desired to be drawn up). We accordingly drew him up instantly, but so\\n', 'incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder. He had brought\\n', 'nothing with him, and had been unable to penetrate more than a very\\n', 'little way into the passage, owing to the constant exertions he found it\\n', 'necessary to make in order to keep himself from floating up against the\\n', 'deck. Upon getting out he was very much exhausted, and had to rest full\\n', 'fifteen minutes before he could again venture to descend.\\n', '\\n', 'The second attempt met with even worse success; for he remained so long\\n', 'under water without giving the signal, that, becoming alarmed for his\\n', 'safety, we drew him out without it, and found that he was almost at the\\n', 'last gasp, having, as he said, repeatedly jerked at the rope without\\n', 'our feeling it. This was probably owing to a portion of it having become\\n', 'entangled in the balustrade at the foot of the ladder. This balustrade\\n', 'was, indeed, so much in the way, that we determined to remove it, if\\n', 'possible, before proceeding with our design. As we had no means of\\n', 'getting it away except by main force, we all descended into the water\\n', 'as far as we could on the ladder, and giving a pull against it with our\\n', 'united strength, succeeded in breaking it down.\\n', '\\n', 'The third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first, and it\\n', 'now became evident that nothing could be done in this manner without the\\n', 'aid of some weight with which the diver might steady himself, and keep\\n', 'to the floor of the cabin while making his search. For a long time we\\n', 'looked about in vain for something which might answer this purpose; but\\n', 'at length, to our great joy, we discovered one of the weather-forechains\\n', 'so loose that we had not the least difficulty in wrenching it off.\\n', 'Having fastened this securely to one of his ankles, Peters now made his\\n', 'fourth descent into the cabin, and this time succeeded in making his way\\n', 'to the door of the steward’s room. To his inexpressible grief, however,\\n', 'he found it locked, and was obliged to return without effecting an\\n', 'entrance, as, with the greatest exertion, he could remain under water\\n', 'not more, at the utmost extent, than a single minute. Our affairs now\\n', 'looked gloomy indeed, and neither Augustus nor myself could refrain from\\n', 'bursting into tears, as we thought of the host of difficulties which\\n', 'encompassed us, and the slight probability which existed of our finally\\n', 'making an escape. But this weakness was not of long duration. Throwing\\n', 'ourselves on our knees to God, we implored His aid in the many dangers\\n', 'which beset us; and arose with renewed hope and vigor to think what\\n', 'could yet be done by mortal means toward accomplishing our deliverance.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'as more intensely productive of emotion, as far more replete with the\\n', 'extremes first of delight and then of horror, than even any of the\\n', 'thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine long years, crowded\\n', 'with events of the most startling and, in many cases, of the most\\n', 'unconceived and unconceivable character. We were lying on the deck near\\n', 'the companion-way, and debating the possibility of yet making our way\\n', 'into the storeroom, when, looking toward Augustus, who lay fronting\\n', 'his lips were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner.\\n', 'turned my head, and shall never forget the ecstatic joy which thrilled\\n', 'to my feet as if a musket bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart;\\n', 'and, stretching out my arms in the direction of the vessel, stood in\\n', 'this manner, motionless, and unable to articulate a syllable. Peters\\n', 'and Parker were equally affected, although in different ways. The former\\n', 'danced about the deck like a madman, uttering the most extravagant\\n', 'rhodomontades, intermingled with howls and imprecations, while the\\n', 'latter burst into tears, and continued for many minutes weeping like a\\n', 'child.\\n', '\\n', 'The vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig, of a Dutch build,\\n', 'and painted black, with a tawdry gilt figure-head. She had evidently\\n', 'seen a good deal of rough weather, and, we supposed, had suffered\\n', 'much in the gale which had proved so disastrous to ourselves; for her\\n', 'foretopmast was gone, and some of her starboard bulwarks. When we first\\n', 'windward, bearing down upon us. The breeze was very gentle, and what\\n', 'astonished us chiefly was, that she had no other sails set than her\\n', 'foremast and mainsail, with a flying jib--of course she came down but\\n', 'slowly, and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy. The awkward\\n', 'manner in which she steered, too, was remarked by all of us, even\\n', 'excited as we were. She yawed about so considerably, that once or twice\\n', 'we thought it impossible she could see us, or imagined that, having seen\\n', 'us, and discovered no person on board, she was about to tack and make\\n', 'off in another direction. Upon each of these occasions we screamed and\\n', 'shouted at the top of our voices, when the stranger would appear to\\n', 'change for a moment her intention, and again hold on toward us--this\\n', 'singular conduct being repeated two or three times, so that at last we\\n', 'could think of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing\\n', 'the helmsman to be in liquor.\\n', '\\n', 'No person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about a\\n', 'quarter of a mile of us. We then saw three seamen, whom by their dress\\n', 'we took to be Hollanders. Two of these were lying on some old sails near\\n', 'the forecastle, and the third, who appeared to be looking at us with\\n', 'great curiosity, was leaning over the starboard bow near the bowsprit.\\n', 'This last was a stout and tall man, with a very dark skin. He seemed\\n', 'by his manner to be encouraging us to have patience, nodding to us in\\n', 'a cheerful although rather odd way, and smiling constantly, so as to\\n', 'display a set of the most brilliantly white teeth. As his vessel drew\\n', 'nearer, we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his head into\\n', 'the water; but of this he took little or no notice, continuing his\\n', '_appeared _to us.\\n', '\\n', 'cannot speak calmly of this event--our hearts leaped up wildly within\\n', 'us, and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and thanksgiving to\\n', 'God for the complete, unexpected, and glorious deliverance that was so\\n', 'palpably at hand. Of a sudden, and all at once, there came wafted over\\n', 'the ocean from the strange vessel (which was now close upon us) a\\n', 'smell, a stench, such as the whole world has no name for--no conception\\n', 'for breath, and turning to my companions, perceived that they were paler\\n', 'than marble. But we had now no time left for question or surmise--the\\n', 'brig was within fifty feet of us, and it seemed to be her intention to\\n', 'run under our counter, that we might board her without putting out a\\n', 'boat. We rushed aft, when, suddenly, a wide yaw threw her off full five\\n', 'or six points from the course she had been running, and, as she passed\\n', 'under our stern at the distance of about twenty feet, we had a full view\\n', 'Twenty-five or thirty human bodies, among whom were several females, lay\\n', 'scattered about between the counter and the galley in the last and most\\n', 'loathsome state of putrefaction. We plainly saw that not a soul lived in\\n', 'that fated vessel! Yet we could not help shouting to the dead for help!\\n', 'Yes, long and loudly did we beg, in the agony of the moment, that those\\n', 'silent and disgusting images would stay for us, would not abandon us to\\n', 'become like them, would receive us among their goodly company! We were\\n', 'raving with horror and despair--thoroughly mad through the anguish of\\n', 'our grievous disappointment.\\n', '\\n', 'As our first loud yell of terror broke forth, it was replied to by\\n', 'something, from near the bowsprit of the stranger, so closely resembling\\n', 'the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might have been startled\\n', 'and deceived. At this instant another sudden yaw brought the region of\\n', 'the forecastle for a moment into view, and we beheld at once the origin\\n', 'of the sound. We saw the tall stout figure still leaning on the bulwark,\\n', 'and still nodding his head to and fro, but his face was now turned from\\n', 'us so that we could not behold it. His arms were extended over the rail,\\n', 'and the palms of his hands fell outward. His knees were lodged upon\\n', 'a stout rope, tightly stretched, and reaching from the heel of the\\n', 'bowsprit to a cathead. On his back, from which a portion of the shirt\\n', 'had been torn, leaving it bare, there sat a huge sea-gull, busily\\n', 'gorging itself with the horrible flesh, its bill and talons deep buried,\\n', 'and its white plumage spattered all over with blood. As the brig moved\\n', 'farther round so as to bring us close in view, the bird, with much\\n', 'apparent difficulty, drew out its crimsoned head, and, after eyeing us\\n', 'for a moment as if stupefied, arose lazily from the body upon which it\\n', 'had been feasting, and, flying directly above our deck, hovered there\\n', 'a while with a portion of clotted and liver-like substance in its beak.\\n', 'The horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash immediately\\n', 'at the feet of Parker. May God forgive me, but now, for the first time,\\n', 'sprang forward quickly, and, with a deep shudder, threw the frightful\\n', 'thing into the sea.\\n', '\\n', 'The body from which it had been taken, resting as it did upon the rope,\\n', 'had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the carnivorous\\n', 'bird, and it was this motion which had at first impressed us with the\\n', 'belief of its being alive. As the gull relieved it of its weight,\\n', 'it swung round and fell partially over, so that the face was fully\\n', 'discovered. Never, surely, was any object so terribly full of awe! The\\n', 'eyes were gone, and the whole flesh around the mouth, leaving the teeth\\n', 'utterly naked. This, then, was the smile which had cheered us on to\\n', 'under our stern, and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward. With\\n', 'her and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of deliverance\\n', 'and joy. Deliberately as she went by, we might possibly have found means\\n', 'of boarding her, had not our sudden disappointment and the appalling\\n', 'nature of the discovery which accompanied it laid entirely prostrate\\n', 'every active faculty of mind and body. We had seen and felt, but\\n', 'we could neither think nor act, until, alas! too late. How much our\\n', 'intellects had been weakened by this incident may be estimated by the\\n', 'fact, that when the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive\\n', 'no more than the half of her hull, the proposition was seriously\\n', 'entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming!\\n', '\\n', 'hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the stranger. Her build\\n', 'that she was a Dutch trader, and the dresses of the crew also sustained\\n', 'this opinion. We might have easily seen the name upon her stern, and,\\n', 'indeed, taken other observations, which would have guided us in making\\n', 'out her character; but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us\\n', 'to every thing of that nature. From the saffron-like hue of such of the\\n', 'corpses as were not entirely decayed, we concluded that the whole of her\\n', 'company had perished by the yellow fever, or some other virulent disease\\n', 'else to imagine), death, to judge from the positions of the bodies, must\\n', 'have come upon them in a manner awfully sudden and overwhelming, in a\\n', 'way totally distinct from that which generally characterizes even\\n', 'the most deadly pestilences with which mankind are acquainted. It is\\n', 'possible, indeed, that poison, accidentally introduced into some of\\n', 'their sea-stores, may have brought about the disaster, or that the\\n', 'eating of some unknown venomous species of fish, or other marine animal,\\n', 'or oceanic bird, might have induced it--but it is utterly useless to\\n', 'form conjectures where all is involved, and will, no doubt, remain for\\n', 'ever involved, in the most appalling and unfathomable mystery.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness, hiding her from\\n', 'our sight, recalled us in some measure to our senses. The pangs\\n', 'of hunger and thirst then returned, absorbing all other cares and\\n', 'considerations. Nothing, however, could be done until the morning,\\n', 'and, securing ourselves as well as possible, we endeavoured to snatch\\n', 'until my companions, who had not been so fortunate, aroused me at\\n', 'daybreak to renew our attempts at getting up provisions from the hull.\\n', '\\n', 'it,--the weather warm and pleasant. The brig was out of sight. We\\n', 'commenced our operations by wrenching off, with some trouble, another of\\n', 'the forechains; and having fastened both to Peters’ feet, he again made\\n', 'an endeavour to reach the door of the storeroom, thinking it possible\\n', 'that he might be able to force it open, provided he could get at it\\n', 'in sufficient time; and this he hoped to do, as the hulk lay much more\\n', 'steadily than before.\\n', '\\n', 'He succeeded very quickly in reaching the door, when, loosening one of\\n', 'the chains from his ankle, he made every exertion to force the passage\\n', 'with it, but in vain, the framework of the room being far stronger than\\n', 'was anticipated. He was quite exhausted with his long stay under water,\\n', 'and it became absolutely necessary that some other one of us should take\\n', 'his place. For this service Parker immediately volunteered; but, after\\n', 'making three ineffectual efforts, found that he could never even succeed\\n', 'in getting near the door. The condition of Augustus’s wounded arm\\n', 'rendered it useless for him to attempt going down, as he would be\\n', 'unable to force the room open should he reach it, and it accordingly now\\n', 'devolved upon me to exert myself for our common deliverance.\\n', '\\n', 'merely to recover the other chain. In groping along the floor of the\\n', 'not having time to ascertain what it was, but returning and ascending\\n', 'instantly to the surface. The prize proved to be a bottle, and our joy\\n', 'wine. Giving thanks to God for this timely and cheering assistance, we\\n', 'immediately drew the cork with my penknife, and, each taking a moderate\\n', 'sup, felt the most indescribable comfort from the warmth, strength,\\n', 'and spirits with which it inspired us. We then carefully recorked the\\n', 'bottle, and, by means of a handkerchief, swung it in such a manner that\\n', 'there was no possibility of its getting broken.\\n', '\\n', 'satisfied that no exertions whatever, in that situation, would enable\\n', 'despair.\\n', '\\n', 'in the countenances of my companions that they had made up their\\n', 'minds to perish. The wine had evidently produced in them a species\\n', 'and about matters unconnected with our condition, Peters repeatedly\\n', 'approached me with a serious air, and requested me to lend him a\\n', 'pocket-comb, as his hair was full of fish-scales, and he wished to get\\n', 'them out before going on shore. Parker appeared somewhat less affected,\\n', 'and urged me to dive at random into the cabin, and bring up any article\\n', 'attempt, after staying under a full minute, brought up a small leather\\n', 'trunk belonging to Captain Barnard. This was immediately opened in the\\n', 'faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink. We found\\n', 'went down again, and returned without any success. As my head came\\n', 'companions had ungratefully taken advantage of my absence to drink the\\n', 'remainder of the wine, having let the bottle fall in the endeavour\\n', 'heartlessness of their conduct, when Augustus burst into tears. The\\n', 'never again to behold laughter of such a species: the distortion of\\n', 'countenance was absolutely frightful. Indeed, it was apparent that the\\n', 'stimulus, in the empty state of their stomachs, had taken instant and\\n', 'violent effect, and that they were all exceedingly intoxicated. With\\n', 'soon into a heavy slumber, accompanied with loud stertorous breathing.\\n', '\\n', 'to be sure, were of the most fearful and gloomy nature. No prospect\\n', 'offered itself to my view but a lingering death by famine, or, at the\\n', 'best, by being overwhelmed in the first gale which should spring up,\\n', 'for in our present exhausted condition we could have no hope of living\\n', 'through another.\\n', '\\n', 'endeavoured to eat it, but found it utterly impossible to swallow a\\n', 'suffering was obtained by chewing small pieces of it and spitting\\n', 'them out. Toward night my companions awoke, one by one, each in an\\n', 'indescribable state of weakness and horror, brought on by the wine,\\n', 'whose fumes had now evaporated. They shook as if with a violent ague,\\n', 'and uttered the most lamentable cries for water. Their condition\\n', 'affected me in the most lively degree, at the same time causing me to\\n', 'rejoice in the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented\\n', 'me from indulging in the wine, and consequently from sharing their\\n', 'melancholy and most distressing sensations. Their conduct, however,\\n', 'gave me great uneasiness and alarm; for it was evident that, unless\\n', 'some favourable change took place, they could afford me no assistance in\\n', 'able to get up something from below; but the attempt could not possibly\\n', 'be resumed until some one of them was sufficiently master of himself to\\n', 'endeavoured, by every means in my power, to rouse him. Thinking that a\\n', 'fasten the end of a rope around his body, and then, leading him to the\\n', 'companion-way (he remaining quite passive all the while), pushed him in,\\n', 'upon having made this experiment; for he appeared much revived and\\n', 'invigorated, and, upon getting out, asked me, in a rational manner, why\\n', 'indebted to me, and said that he felt greatly better from the immersion,\\n', 'afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation. We then resolved to\\n', 'treat Augustus and Peters in the same way, which we immediately did,\\n', 'when they both experienced much benefit from the shock. This idea of\\n', 'sudden immersion had been suggested to me by reading in some medical\\n', 'work the good effect of the shower-bath in a case where the patient was\\n', 'suffering from _mania a potu_.\\n', '\\n', 'now quite dark, and a gentle but long swell from the northward rendered\\n', 'in bringing up two case-knives, a three-gallon jug, empty, and a\\n', 'but brought up nothing else. During the night Parker and Peters occupied\\n', 'themselves by turns in the same manner; but nothing coming to hand, we\\n', 'now gave up this attempt in despair, concluding that we were exhausting\\n', 'ourselves in vain.\\n', '\\n', 'We passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most intense\\n', 'mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined. The morning of\\n', 'the sixteenth at length dawned, and we looked eagerly around the horizon\\n', 'for relief, but to no purpose. The sea was still smooth, with only a\\n', 'long swell from the northward, as on yesterday. This was the sixth day\\n', 'since we had tasted either food or drink, with the exception of the\\n', 'bottle of port wine, and it was clear that we could hold out but a very\\n', 'before, nor wish to see again, human beings so utterly emaciated as\\n', 'could not bring myself to believe them really the same individuals with\\n', 'reduced, and so feeble that he could not raise his head from his bosom,\\n', 'was not so far gone as the other two. He suffered with great patience,\\n', 'making no complaint, and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every\\n', 'manner he could devise. For myself, although at the commencement of\\n', 'frame, and retaining my powers of mind in a surprising degree, while the\\n', 'rest were completely prostrated in intellect, and seemed to be\\n', 'brought to a species of second childhood, generally simpering in\\n', 'their expressions, with idiotic smiles, and uttering the most absurd\\n', 'platitudes. At intervals, however, they would appear to revive suddenly,\\n', 'as if inspired all at once with a consciousness of their condition, when\\n', 'they would spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour, and\\n', 'speak, for a short period, of their prospects, in a manner altogether\\n', 'rational, although full of the most intense despair. It is possible,\\n', 'however, that my companions may have entertained the same opinion of\\n', 'unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and imbecilities as\\n', 'themselves--this is a matter which cannot be determined.\\n', '\\n', 'About noon Parker declared that he saw land off the larboard quarter,\\n', 'into the sea with the view of swimming toward it. Peters and Augustus\\n', 'took little notice of what he said, being apparently wrapped up in moody\\n', 'aware that we were far from any land to indulge in a hope of that\\n', 'of his mistake. He then burst into a flood of tears, weeping like a\\n', 'child, with loud cries and sobs, for two or three hours, when becoming\\n', 'exhausted, he fell asleep.\\n', '\\n', 'Peters and Augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to swallow\\n', 'continued to chew pieces of it at intervals, and found some relief from\\n', 'taking a draught from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences\\n', 'which thus have resulted to others who were similarly situated with\\n', 'ourselves.\\n', '\\n', 'eastward, and on our larboard bow. She appeared to be a large ship, and\\n', 'was coming nearly athwart us, being probably twelve or fifteen miles\\n', 'to tell them of her for the present, lest we might again be disappointed\\n', 'contain myself no longer, and pointed her out to my fellow-sufferers.\\n', 'They immediately sprang to their feet, again indulging in the most\\n', 'extravagant demonstrations of joy, weeping, laughing in an idiotic\\n', 'manner, jumping, stamping upon the deck, tearing their hair, and praying\\n', 'refrain from joining in with their madness, and gave way to the impulses\\n', 'of my gratitude and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck, clapping\\n', 'to my recollection, and once more to the extreme human misery and\\n', 'despair, by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully\\n', 'presented toward us, and steering in a direction nearly opposite to that\\n', '\\n', 'that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken place. They\\n', 'replied to all my assertions with a stare and a gesture implying that\\n', 'they were not to be deceived by such misrepresentations. The conduct of\\n', 'the contrary, he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing\\n', 'us, and in making preparations to go on board of her. Some seaweed\\n', 'floating by the brig, he maintained that it was the ship’s boat, and\\n', 'endeavoured to throw himself upon it, howling and shrieking in the most\\n', 'himself into the sea.\\n', '\\n', 'Having become in some degree pacified, we continued to watch the ship\\n', 'until we finally lost sight of her, the weather becoming hazy, with\\n', 'a light breeze springing up. As soon as she was entirely gone, Parker\\n', 'turned suddenly toward me with an expression of countenance which made\\n', 'not noticed in him until now, and before he opened his lips my heart\\n', 'told me what he would say. He proposed, in a few words, that one of us\\n', 'should die to preserve the existence of the others.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'to this last horrible extremity, and had secretly made up my mind to\\n', 'suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances rather than resort\\n', 'to such a course. Nor was this resolution in any degree weakened by the\\n', 'aside; and mentally praying to God for power to dissuade him from the\\n', 'time, and in the most supplicating manner, begging him in the name of\\n', 'every thing which he held sacred, and urging him by every species of\\n', 'argument which the extremity of the case suggested, to abandon the idea,\\n', 'and not to mention it to either of the other two.\\n', '\\n', 'the most horrible alternative which could enter into the mind of man;\\n', 'but that he had now held out as long as human nature could be sustained;\\n', 'that it was unnecessary for all to perish, when, by the death of one,\\n', 'it was possible, and even probable, that the rest might be finally\\n', 'him from his purpose, his mind having been thoroughly made up on the\\n', 'subject even before the appearance of the ship, and that only her\\n', 'heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention at an\\n', 'earlier period.\\n', '\\n', 'design, at least to defer it for another day, when some vessel might\\n', 'He said, in reply, that he had not spoken until the very last possible\\n', 'moment, that he could exist no longer without sustenance of some kind,\\n', 'and that therefore in another day his suggestion would be too late, as\\n', 'regarded himself at least.\\n', '\\n', 'health and strength, consequently, were at that moment far better than\\n', 'and that if he attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his\\n', 'sea. Upon this he immediately seized me by the throat, and drawing a\\n', 'knife, made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in the stomach;\\n', 'an atrocity which his excessive debility alone prevented him from\\n', 'forced him to the vessel’s side, with the full intention of throwing him\\n', 'overboard. He was saved from his fate, however, by the interference of\\n', 'Peters, who now approached and separated us, asking the cause of the\\n', 'prevent him.\\n', '\\n', 'anticipated. Both Augustus and Peters, who, it seems, had long secretly\\n', 'entertained the same fearful idea which Parker had been merely the\\n', 'first to broach, joined with him in his design and insisted upon its\\n', 'least of the two former would be found still possessed of sufficient\\n', 'strength of mind to side with myself in resisting any attempt to execute\\n', 'fear of being able to prevent its accomplishment. Being disappointed in\\n', 'to my own safety, as a further resistance on my part might possibly be\\n', 'considered by men in their frightful condition a sufficient excuse\\n', 'enacted.\\n', '\\n', 'requesting a delay of about one hour, in order that the fog which had\\n', 'gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting, when it was\\n', 'possible that the ship we had seen might be again in sight. After great\\n', 'had anticipated (a breeze rapidly coming in), the fog lifted before the\\n', 'hour had expired, when, no vessel appearing in sight, we prepared to\\n', 'draw lots.\\n', '\\n', 'which ensued; a scene which, with its minutest details, no after events\\n', 'have been able to efface in the slightest degree from my memory,\\n', 'and whose stern recollection will embitter every future moment of my\\n', 'existence. Let me run over this portion of my narrative with as much\\n', 'haste as the nature of the events to be spoken of will permit. The only\\n', 'method we could devise for the terrific lottery, in which we were to\\n', 'take each a chance, was that of drawing straws. Small splinters of wood\\n', 'silently took up their station in the other with their backs turned\\n', 'lots. There are few conditions into which man can possibly fall where he\\n', 'will not feel a deep interest in the preservation of his existence;\\n', 'an interest momentarily increasing with the frailness of the tenure by\\n', 'which that existence may be held. But now that the silent, definite, and\\n', 'the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually approaching horrors\\n', 'the most appalling of deaths--a death for the most appalling of\\n', 'purposes--every particle of that energy which had so long buoyed me up\\n', 'departed like feathers before the wind, leaving me a helpless prey to\\n', 'up sufficient strength to tear and fit together the small splinters of\\n', 'wood, my fingers absolutely refusing their office, and my knees knocking\\n', 'violently against each other. My mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd\\n', 'projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful speculation.\\n', 'to let me escape this necessity; of suddenly rushing upon them, and,\\n', 'by putting one of them to death, of rendering the decision by lot\\n', 'useless--in short, of every thing but of going through with the matter\\n', 'me to relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were enduring.\\n', 'some one of my fellow-sufferers to draw the short straw, as it had been\\n', 'agreed that whoever drew the shortest of four splinters from my hand was\\n', 'to die for the preservation of the rest. Before any one condemn me for\\n', 'this apparent heartlessness, let him be placed in a situation precisely\\n', 'similar to my own.\\n', '\\n', 'At length delay was no longer possible, and, with a heart almost\\n', 'splinters, and Peters immediately drew. He was free--his, at least, was\\n', 'not the shortest; and there was now another chance against my escape.\\n', 'or die, the chances were no more than precisely even. At this moment\\n', 'my poor fellow-creature, Parker, the most intense, the most diabolical\\n', 'hatred. But the feeling did not last; and, at length, with a convulsive\\n', 'him. It was fully five minutes before he could summon resolution to\\n', 'my eyes. Presently one of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand.\\n', '\\n', 'tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental in\\n', 'bringing it about. He made no resistance whatever, and was stabbed in\\n', 'upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued. Such things may be\\n', 'imagined, but words have no power to impress the mind with the exquisite\\n', 'horror of their reality. Let it suffice to say that, having in some\\n', 'measure appeased the raging thirst which consumed us by the blood of\\n', 'the victim, and having by common consent taken off the hands, feet,\\n', 'and head, throwing them together with the entrails, into the sea, we\\n', 'devoured the rest of the body, piecemeal, during the four ever memorable\\n', 'days of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth of the\\n', 'month.\\n', '\\n', 'On the nineteenth, there coming on a smart shower which lasted fifteen\\n', 'or twenty minutes, we contrived to catch some water by means of a sheet\\n', 'which had been fished up from the cabin by our drag just after the gale.\\n', 'The quantity we took in all did not amount to more than half a gallon;\\n', 'but even this scanty allowance supplied us with comparative strength and\\n', 'hope.\\n', '\\n', 'On the twenty-first we were again reduced to the last necessity. The\\n', 'weather still remained warm and pleasant, with occasional fogs and light\\n', '\\n', 'On the twenty-second, as we were sitting close huddled together,\\n', 'gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition, there flashed through\\n', 'my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a bright gleam of\\n', 'being in the windward chains, passed one of the axes into my hand,\\n', 'requesting me to put it, if possible, in a place of security, and that\\n', 'a few minutes before the last heavy sea struck the brig and filled her\\n', 'axe, we might cut through the deck over the storeroom, and thus readily\\n', 'supply ourselves with provisions.\\n', '\\n', 'shout of joy, and we all proceeded forthwith to the forecastle. The\\n', 'difficulty of descending here was greater than that of going down in the\\n', 'cabin, the opening being much smaller, for it will be remembered that\\n', 'the whole framework about the cabin companion-hatch had been carried\\n', 'away, whereas the forecastle-way, being a simple hatch of only about\\n', 'to attempt the descent; and a rope being fastened round my body as\\n', 'berth, and at the first attempt brought up the axe. It was hailed with\\n', 'the most ecstatic joy and triumph, and the ease with which it had been\\n', 'obtained was regarded as an omen of our ultimate preservation.\\n', '\\n', 'We now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of rekindled\\n', 'hope, Peters and myself taking the axe by turns, Augustus’s wounded arm\\n', 'not permitting him to aid us in any degree. As we were still so feeble\\n', 'as to be scarcely able to stand unsupported, and could consequently work\\n', 'but a minute or two without resting, it soon became evident that many\\n', 'long hours would be necessary to accomplish our task--that is, to cut an\\n', 'opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the storeroom.\\n', 'This consideration, however, did not discourage us; and, working all\\n', 'night by the light of the moon, we succeeded in effecting our purpose by\\n', 'daybreak on the morning of the twenty-third.\\n', '\\n', 'Peters now volunteered to go down; and, having made all arrangements\\n', 'as before, he descended, and soon returned bringing up with him a small\\n', 'jar, which, to our great joy, proved to be full of olives. Having\\n', 'shared these among us, and devoured them with the greatest avidity,\\n', 'we proceeded to let him down again. This time he succeeded beyond our\\n', 'utmost expectations, returning instantly with a large ham and a bottle\\n', 'of Madeira wine. Of the latter we each took a moderate sup, having\\n', 'learned by experience the pernicious consequences of indulging too\\n', 'freely. The ham, except about two pounds near the bone, was not in a\\n', 'condition to be eaten, having been entirely spoiled by the salt water.\\n', 'The sound part was divided among us. Peters and Augustus, not being able\\n', 'more cautious, and ate but a small portion of mine, dreading the thirst\\n', 'had been intolerably severe.\\n', '\\n', 'By noon, feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed, we again renewed\\n', 'our attempt at getting up provisions, Peters and myself going down\\n', 'alternately, and always with more or less success, until sundown. During\\n', 'this interval we had the good fortune to bring up, altogether, four\\n', 'more small jars of olives, another ham, a carboy containing nearly three\\n', 'gallons of excellent Cape Madeira wine, and, what gave us still more\\n', 'delight, a small tortoise of the Gallipago breed, several of which had\\n', 'been taken on board by Captain Barnard, as the _Grampus_ was leaving\\n', 'port, from the schooner _Mary Pitts_, just returned from a sealing\\n', 'voyage in the Pacific.\\n', '\\n', 'to mention this species of tortoise. It is found principally, as most\\n', 'of my readers may know, in the group of islands called the Gallipagos,\\n', 'which, indeed, derive their name from the animal--the Spanish word\\n', 'Gallipago meaning a fresh-water terrapin. From the peculiarity of their\\n', 'shape and action they have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise.\\n', 'several which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds,\\n', 'weighing more than eight hundred. Their appearance is singular, and even\\n', 'disgusting. Their steps are very slow, measured, and heavy, their bodies\\n', 'being carried about a foot from the ground. Their neck is long, and\\n', 'exceedingly slender, from eighteen inches to two feet is a very common\\n', 'extremity of the head was no less than three feet ten inches. The head\\n', 'has a striking resemblance to that of a serpent. They can exist without\\n', 'food for an almost incredible length of time, instances having been\\n', 'known where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain\\n', 'two years without nourishment of any kind--being as fat, and, in every\\n', 'respect, in as good order at the expiration of the time as when they\\n', 'were first put in. In one particular these extraordinary animals bear\\n', 'a resemblance to the dromedary, or camel of the desert. In a bag at the\\n', 'root of the neck they carry with them a constant supply of water. In\\n', 'some instances, upon killing them after a full year’s deprivation of all\\n', 'nourishment, as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water\\n', 'have been found in their bags. Their food is chiefly wild parsley and\\n', 'celery, with purslain, sea-kelp, and prickly pears, upon which latter\\n', 'vegetable they thrive wonderfully, a great quantity of it being usually\\n', 'found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the animal itself is\\n', 'discovered. They are excellent and highly nutritious food, and have,\\n', 'no doubt, been the means of preserving the lives of thousands of seamen\\n', 'employed in the whale-fishery and other pursuits in the Pacific.\\n', '\\n', 'The one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the storeroom was\\n', 'not of a large size, weighing probably sixty-five or seventy pounds.\\n', 'It was a female, and in excellent condition, being exceedingly fat, and\\n', 'having more than a quart of limpid and sweet water in its bag. This\\n', 'was indeed a treasure; and, falling on our knees with one accord, we\\n', 'returned fervent thanks to God for so seasonable a relief.\\n', '\\n', 'We had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the opening, as\\n', 'its struggles were fierce and its strength prodigious. It was upon the\\n', 'point of making its escape from Peter’s grasp, and slipping back into\\n', 'the water, when Augustus, throwing a rope with a slipknot around its\\n', 'side of Peters, and assisted him in lifting it out.\\n', '\\n', 'The water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug; which, it will be\\n', 'remembered, had been brought up before from the cabin. Having done this,\\n', 'we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to form, with the cork, a kind\\n', 'of glass, holding not quite half a gill. We then each drank one of these\\n', 'measures full, and resolved to limit ourselves to this quantity per day\\n', 'as long as it should hold out.\\n', '\\n', 'During the last two or three days, the weather having been dry and\\n', 'pleasant, the bedding we had obtained from the cabin, as well as our\\n', 'clothing, had become thoroughly dry, so that we passed this night (that\\n', 'of the twenty-third) in comparative comfort, enjoying a tranquil\\n', 'repose, after having supped plentifully on olives and ham, with a\\n', 'small allowance of the wine. Being afraid of losing some of our stores\\n', 'overboard during the night, in the event of a breeze springing up, we\\n', 'secured them as well as possible with cordage to the fragments of the\\n', 'windlass. Our tortoise, which we were anxious to preserve alive as long\\n', 'as we could, we threw on its back, and otherwise carefully fastened.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'strength. Notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were still\\n', 'placed, ignorant of our position, although certainly at a great distance\\n', 'from land, without more food than would last us for a fortnight even\\n', 'with great care, almost entirely without water, and floating about at\\n', 'the mercy of every wind and wave on the merest wreck in the world, still\\n', 'the infinitely more terrible distresses and dangers from which we had so\\n', 'lately and so providentially been delivered caused us to regard what\\n', 'we now endured as but little more than an ordinary evil--so strictly\\n', 'comparative is either good or ill.\\n', '\\n', 'At sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up\\n', 'something from the storeroom, when, a smart shower coming on, with some\\n', 'lightning, we turn our attention to the catching of water by means of\\n', 'the sheet we had used before for this purpose. We had no other means of\\n', 'collecting the rain than by holding the sheet spread out with one of the\\n', 'forechain-plates in the middle of it. The water, thus conducted to the\\n', 'centre, was drained through into our jug. We had nearly filled it in\\n', 'this manner, when, a heavy squall coming on from the northward, obliged\\n', 'us to desist, as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that\\n', 'we could no longer keep our feet. We now went forward, and, lashing\\n', 'ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before, awaited the\\n', 'event with far more calmness than could have been anticipated or would\\n', 'have been imagined possible under the circumstances. At noon the wind\\n', 'had freshened into a two-reef breeze, and by night into a stiff gale,\\n', 'accompanied with a tremendously heavy swell. Experience having taught\\n', 'us, however, the best method of arranging our lashings, we weathered\\n', 'this dreary night in tolerable security, although thoroughly drenched at\\n', 'almost every instant by the sea, and in momentary dread of being washed\\n', 'off. Fortunately, the weather was so warm as to render the water rather\\n', 'grateful than otherwise.\\n', '\\n', 'July 25. This morning the gale had diminished to a mere ten-knot breeze,\\n', 'and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we were able to\\n', 'keep ourselves dry upon the deck. To our great grief, however, we found\\n', 'that two jars of our olives, as well as the whole of our ham, had been\\n', 'washed overboard, in spite of the careful manner in which they had been\\n', 'fastened. We determined not to kill the tortoise as yet, and contented\\n', 'ourselves for the present with a breakfast on a few of the olives, and\\n', 'a measure of water each, which latter we mixed half and half, with\\n', 'wine, finding great relief and strength from the mixture, without the\\n', 'distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the port. The\\n', 'sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at getting up\\n', 'provision from the storeroom. Several articles, of no importance to us\\n', 'in our present situation, floated up through the opening during the day,\\n', 'and were immediately washed overboard. We also now observed that the\\n', 'hulk lay more along than ever, so that we could not stand an instant\\n', 'without lashing ourselves. On this account we passed a gloomy and\\n', 'uncomfortable day. At noon the sun appeared to be nearly vertical, and\\n', 'we had no doubt that we had been driven down by the long succession of\\n', 'northward and northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator.\\n', 'Toward evening we saw several sharks, and were somewhat alarmed by the\\n', 'audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us. At one\\n', 'time, a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the water, the monster\\n', 'actually swam in upon us, floundering for some moments just over the\\n', 'sea at length hurled him overboard, much to our relief. In moderate\\n', 'weather we might have easily captured him.\\n', '\\n', 'July 26. This morning, the wind having greatly abated, and the sea not\\n', 'being very rough, we determined to renew our exertions in the storeroom.\\n', 'After a great deal of hard labor during the whole day, we found that\\n', 'nothing further was to be expected from this quarter, the partitions of\\n', 'the room having been stove during the night, and its contents swept into\\n', 'the hold. This discovery, as may be supposed, filled us with despair.\\n', '\\n', 'July 27. The sea nearly smooth, with a light wind, and still from the\\n', 'northward and westward. The sun coming out hotly in the afternoon,\\n', 'we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes. Found great relief from\\n', 'thirst, and much comfort otherwise, by bathing in the sea; in this,\\n', 'however, we were forced to use great caution, being afraid of sharks,\\n', 'several of which were seen swimming around the brig during the day.\\n', '\\n', 'July 28. Good weather still. The brig now began to lie along so\\n', 'alarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up. Prepared\\n', 'ourselves as well as we could for this emergency, lashing our tortoise,\\n', 'waterjug, and two remaining jars of olives as far as possible over to\\n', 'the windward, placing them outside the hull below the main-chains. The\\n', 'sea very smooth all day, with little or no wind.\\n', '\\n', 'to evince symptoms of mortification. He complained of drowsiness and\\n', 'excessive thirst, but no acute pain. Nothing could be done for his\\n', 'relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of the vinegar from the\\n', 'olives, and from this no benefit seemed to be experienced. We did every\\n', 'thing in our power for his comfort, and trebled his allowance of water.\\n', '\\n', 'July 30. An excessively hot day, with no wind. An enormous shark kept\\n', 'close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon. We made several\\n', 'unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose. Augustus much\\n', 'worse, and evidently sinking as much from want of proper nourishment as\\n', 'from the effect of his wounds. He constantly prayed to be relieved from\\n', 'his sufferings, wishing for nothing but death. This evening we ate the\\n', 'last of our olives, and found the water in our jug so putrid that we\\n', 'could not swallow it at all without the addition of wine. Determined to\\n', 'kill our tortoise in the morning.\\n', '\\n', 'July 31. After a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue, owing to the\\n', 'position of the hulk, we set about killing and cutting up our tortoise.\\n', 'He proved to be much smaller than we had supposed, although in good\\n', 'condition,--the whole meat about him not amounting to more than ten\\n', 'pounds. With a view of preserving a portion of this as long as possible,\\n', 'we cut it into fine pieces, and filled with them our three remaining\\n', 'olive jars and the wine-bottle (all of which had been kept), pouring in\\n', 'afterward the vinegar from the olives. In this manner we put away about\\n', 'three pounds of the tortoise, intending not to touch it until we had\\n', 'consumed the rest. We concluded to restrict ourselves to about four\\n', 'ounces of the meat per day; the whole would thus last us thirteen days.\\n', 'but lasted so short a time that we only succeeded in catching about\\n', 'half a pint of water. The whole of this, by common consent, was given\\n', 'to Augustus, who now appeared to be in the last extremity. He drank the\\n', 'water from the sheet as we caught it (we holding it above him as he lay\\n', 'so as to let it run into his mouth), for we had now nothing left capable\\n', 'of holding water, unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from the\\n', 'carboy, or the stale water from the jug. Either of these expedients\\n', 'would have been resorted to had the shower lasted.\\n', '\\n', 'The sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the draught. His\\n', 'arm was completely black from the wrist to the shoulder, and his feet\\n', 'were like ice. We expected every moment to see him breathe his last.\\n', 'He was frightfully emaciated; so much so that, although he weighed a\\n', 'hundred and twenty-seven pounds upon his leaving Nantucket, he now did\\n', 'not weigh more than forty or fifty at the farthest. His eyes were sunk\\n', 'far in his head, being scarcely perceptible, and the skin of his\\n', 'cheeks hung so loosely as to prevent his masticating any food, or even\\n', 'swallowing any liquid, without great difficulty.\\n', '\\n', 'hot sun. Suffered exceedingly from thirst, the water in the jug being\\n', 'absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin. We contrived, nevertheless,\\n', 'to swallow a portion of it by mixing it with wine; our thirst, however,\\n', 'was but little abated. We found more relief by bathing in the sea, but\\n', 'could not avail ourselves of this expedient except at long intervals,\\n', 'on account of the continual presence of sharks. We now saw clearly that\\n', 'Augustus could not be saved; that he was evidently dying. We could do\\n', 'nothing to relieve his sufferings, which appeared to be great. About\\n', 'twelve o’clock he expired in strong convulsions, and without having\\n', 'spoken for several hours. His death filled us with the most gloomy\\n', 'forebodings, and had so great an effect upon our spirits that we sat\\n', 'motionless by the corpse during the whole day, and never addressed each\\n', 'other except in a whisper. It was not until some time after dark that\\n', 'we took courage to get up and throw the body overboard. It was then\\n', 'loathsome beyond expression, and so far decayed that, as Peters\\n', 'attempted to lift it, an entire leg came off in his grasp. As the mass\\n', 'of putrefaction slipped over the vessel’s side into the water, the glare\\n', 'of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly discovered to\\n', 'us seven or eight large sharks, the clashing of whose horrible teeth, as\\n', 'their prey was torn to pieces among them, might have been heard at\\n', 'the distance of a mile. We shrunk within ourselves in the extremity of\\n', 'horror at the sound.\\n', '\\n', 'August 2. The same fearfully calm and hot weather. The dawn found us in\\n', 'a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion. The water\\n', 'in the jug was now absolutely useless, being a thick gelatinous mass;\\n', 'nothing but frightful-looking worms mingled with slime. We threw it out,\\n', 'and washed the jug well in the sea, afterward pouring a little vinegar\\n', 'in it from our bottles of pickled tortoise. Our thirst could now\\n', 'scarcely be endured, and we tried in vain to relieve it by wine, which\\n', 'seemed only to add fuel to the flame, and excited us to a high degree\\n', 'of intoxication. We afterward endeavoured to relieve our sufferings by\\n', 'mixing the wine with seawater; but this instantly brought about the most\\n', 'violent retchings, so that we never again attempted it. During the whole\\n', 'day we anxiously sought an opportunity of bathing, but to no purpose;\\n', 'for the hulk was now entirely besieged on all sides with sharks--no\\n', 'doubt the identical monsters who had devoured our poor companion on the\\n', 'evening before, and who were in momentary expectation of another similar\\n', 'feast. This circumstance occasioned us the most bitter regret and\\n', 'filled us with the most depressing and melancholy forebodings. We had\\n', 'experienced indescribable relief in bathing, and to have this resource\\n', 'cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we could bear. Nor,\\n', 'indeed, were we altogether free from the apprehension of immediate\\n', 'danger, for the least slip or false movement would have thrown us\\n', 'at once within reach of those voracious fish, who frequently thrust\\n', 'themselves directly upon us, swimming up to leeward. No shouts or\\n', 'exertions on our part seemed to alarm them. Even when one of the largest\\n', 'was struck with an axe by Peters and much wounded, he persisted in his\\n', 'extreme anguish, passed over without discharging itself. It is quite\\n', 'impossible to conceive our sufferings from thirst at this period. We\\n', 'passed a sleepless night, both on this account and through dread of the\\n', 'sharks.\\n', '\\n', 'along, so that now we could not maintain a footing upon deck at all.\\n', 'Busied ourselves in securing our wine and tortoise-meat, so that we\\n', 'might not lose them in the event of our rolling over. Got out two stout\\n', 'spikes from the forechains, and, by means of the axe, drove them into\\n', 'the hull to windward within a couple of feet of the water, this not\\n', 'being very far from the keel, as we were nearly upon our beam-ends. To\\n', 'these spikes we now lashed our provisions, as being more secure than\\n', 'their former position beneath the chains. Suffered great agony from\\n', 'thirst during the whole day--no chance of bathing on account of the\\n', 'sharks, which never left us for a moment. Found it impossible to sleep.\\n', '\\n', 'heeling over, and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off by the\\n', 'movement. At first the roll was slow and gradual, and we contrived to\\n', 'clamber over to windward very well, having taken the precaution to leave\\n', 'ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven in for the provision. But\\n', 'we had not calculated sufficiently upon the acceleration of the impetus;\\n', 'for, presently the heel became too violent to allow of our keeping pace\\n', 'with it; and, before either of us knew what was to happen, we found\\n', 'ourselves hurled furiously into the sea, and struggling several fathoms\\n', 'beneath the surface, with the huge hull immediately above us.\\n', '\\n', 'deceived, not having taken into consideration the natural rebound of\\n', 'the hull to windward. The whirl of the water upward, which the vessel\\n', 'occasioned in rolling partially back, brought me to the surface still\\n', 'was lying keel up, rocking furiously from side to side, and the sea in\\n', 'all directions around was much agitated, and full of strong whirlpools.\\n', 'feet of me, and various other articles from the brig were scattered\\n', 'about.\\n', '\\n', 'in my vicinity. In order to deter these, if possible, from approaching\\n', 'the sea all round the brig, just before her rolling over, was so crowded\\n', 'contact with some of them during my progress. By great good fortune,\\n', 'been able to get upon it but for the timely assistance of Peters, who,\\n', 'now, to my great joy, made his appearance (having scrambled up to the\\n', 'keel from the opposite side of the hull), and threw me the end of a\\n', 'rope--one of those which had been attached to the spikes.\\n', '\\n', 'Having barely escaped this danger, our attention was now directed to the\\n', 'dreadful imminency of another--that of absolute starvation. Our whole\\n', 'stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of all our care in\\n', 'securing it; and seeing no longer the remotest possibility of obtaining\\n', 'more, we gave way both of us to despair, weeping aloud like children,\\n', 'and neither of us attempting to offer consolation to the other. Such\\n', 'weakness can scarcely be conceived, and to those who have never been\\n', 'similarly situated will, no doubt, appear unnatural; but it must be\\n', 'remembered that our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long\\n', 'course of privation and terror to which we had been subjected, that we\\n', 'could not justly be considered, at that period, in the light of rational\\n', 'up with fortitude against all the evils of my situation, and Peters, it\\n', 'will be seen, evinced a stoical philosophy nearly as incredible as his\\n', 'present childlike supineness and imbecility--the mental condition made\\n', 'the difference.\\n', '\\n', 'The overturning of the brig, even with the consequent loss of the\\n', 'wine and turtle, would not, in fact, have rendered our situation more\\n', 'deplorable than before, except for the disappearance of the bedclothes\\n', 'by which we had been hitherto enabled to catch rainwater, and of the jug\\n', 'in which we had kept it when caught; for we found the whole bottom, from\\n', 'within two or three feet of the bends as far as the keel, together with\\n', 'the keel itself, thickly covered with large barnacles, which proved\\n', 'to be excellent and highly nutritious food. Thus, in two important\\n', 'respects, the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved to be a benefit\\n', 'rather than an injury; it had opened to us a supply of provisions which\\n', 'we could not have exhausted, using it moderately, in a month; and it had\\n', 'greatly contributed to our comfort as regards position, we being much\\n', 'more at ease, and in infinitely less danger, than before.\\n', '\\n', 'The difficulty, however, of now obtaining water blinded us to all the\\n', 'benefits of the change in our condition. That we might be ready to avail\\n', 'ourselves, as far as possible, of any shower which might fall we took\\n', 'off our shirts, to make use of them as we had of the sheets--not hoping,\\n', 'of course, to get more in this way, even under the most favorable\\n', 'circumstances, than half a gill at a time. No signs of a cloud appeared\\n', 'during the day, and the agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable.\\n', 'At night, Peters obtained about an hour’s disturbed sleep, but my\\n', 'intense sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single\\n', 'moment.\\n', '\\n', 'August 5. To-day, a gentle breeze springing up carried us through a vast\\n', 'quantity of seaweed, among which we were so fortunate as to find eleven\\n', 'small crabs, which afforded us several delicious meals. Their shells\\n', 'being quite soft, we ate them entire, and found that they irritated our\\n', 'thirst far less than the barnacles. Seeing no trace of sharks among the\\n', 'seaweed, we also ventured to bathe, and remained in the water for four\\n', 'or five hours, during which we experienced a very sensible diminution\\n', 'of our thirst. Were greatly refreshed, and spent the night somewhat more\\n', 'comfortably than before, both of us snatching a little sleep.\\n', '\\n', 'August 6. This day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain,\\n', 'lasting from about noon until after dark. Bitterly did we now regret the\\n', 'loss of our jug and carboy; for, in spite of the little means we had of\\n', 'catching the water, we might have filled one, if not both of them. As\\n', 'it was, we contrived to satisfy the cravings of thirst by suffering\\n', 'the shirts to become saturated, and then wringing them so as to let the\\n', 'grateful fluid trickle into our mouths. In this occupation we passed the\\n', 'entire day.\\n', '\\n', 'August 7. Just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a\\n', 'sail to the eastward, and _evidently coming towards us!_ We hailed the\\n', 'glorious sight with a long, although feeble shout of rapture; and began\\n', 'instantly to make every signal in our power, by flaring the shirts in\\n', 'the air, leaping as high as our weak condition would permit, and even by\\n', 'hallooing with all the strength of our lungs, although the vessel\\n', 'could not have been less than fifteen miles distant. However, she\\n', 'still continued to near our hulk, and we felt that, if she but held her\\n', 'present course, she must eventually come so close as to perceive us. In\\n', 'about an hour after we first discovered her, we could clearly see the\\n', 'people on her decks. She was a long, low, and rakish-looking topsail\\n', 'schooner, with a black ball in her foretopsail, and had, apparently,\\n', 'a full crew. We now became alarmed, for we could hardly imagine it\\n', 'possible that she did not observe us, and were apprehensive that she\\n', 'meant to leave us to perish as we were--an act of fiendish barbarity,\\n', 'which, however incredible it may appear, has been repeatedly perpetuated\\n', 'at sea, under circumstances very nearly similar, and by beings who\\n', 'were regarded as belonging to the human species. {*2} In this instance,\\n', 'however, by the mercy of God, we were destined to be most happily\\n', 'deceived; for, presently we were aware of a sudden commotion on the deck\\n', 'of the stranger, who immediately afterward ran up a British flag, and,\\n', 'hauling her wind, bore up directly upon us. In half an hour more\\n', 'we found ourselves in her cabin. She proved to be the Jane Guy, of\\n', 'Liverpool, Captain Guy, bound on a sealing and trading voyage to the\\n', 'South Seas and Pacific.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'eighty tons burden. She was unusually sharp in the bows, and on a wind,\\n', 'however, as a rough sea-boat, were not so good, and her draught of water\\n', 'was by far too great for the trade to which she was destined. For this\\n', 'peculiar service, a larger vessel, and one of a light proportionate\\n', 'draught, is desirable--say a vessel of from three hundred to three\\n', 'hundred and fifty tons. She should be bark-rigged, and in other respects\\n', 'of a different construction from the usual South Sea ships. It is\\n', 'absolutely necessary that she should be well armed. She should have, say\\n', 'ten or twelve twelve-pound carronades, and two or three long twelves,\\n', 'with brass blunderbusses, and water-tight arm-chests for each top. Her\\n', 'anchors and cables should be of far greater strength than is required\\n', 'for any other species of trade, and, above all, her crew should be\\n', 'than fifty or sixty able-bodied men. The Jane Guy had a crew of\\n', 'thirty-five, all able seamen, besides the captain and mate, but she\\n', 'was not altogether as well armed or otherwise equipped, as a navigator\\n', 'acquainted with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have\\n', 'desired.\\n', '\\n', 'Captain Guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner, and of\\n', 'considerable experience in the southern traffic, to which he had devoted\\n', 'a great portion of his life. He was deficient, however, in energy, and,\\n', 'consequently, in that spirit of enterprise which is here so absolutely\\n', 'requisite. He was part owner of the vessel in which he sailed, and was\\n', 'invested with discretionary powers to cruise in the South Seas for any\\n', 'cargo which might come most readily to hand. He had on board, as usual\\n', 'in such voyages, beads, looking-glasses, tinder-works, axes, hatchets,\\n', 'saws, adzes, planes, chisels, gouges, gimlets, files, spokeshaves,\\n', 'rasps, hammers, nails, knives, scissors, razors, needles, thread,\\n', 'crockery-ware, calico, trinkets, and other similar articles.\\n', '\\n', 'The schooner sailed from Liverpool on the tenth of July, crossed the\\n', 'Tropic of Cancer on the twenty-fifth, in longitude twenty degrees west,\\n', 'and reached Sal, one of the Cape Verd islands, on the twenty-ninth,\\n', 'where she took in salt and other necessaries for the voyage. On\\n', 'the third of August, she left the Cape Verds and steered southwest,\\n', 'stretching over toward the coast of Brazil, so as to cross the equator\\n', 'between the meridians of twenty-eight and thirty degrees west longitude.\\n', 'This is the course usually taken by vessels bound from Europe to the\\n', 'Cape of Good Hope, or by that route to the East Indies. By proceeding\\n', 'thus they avoid the calms and strong contrary currents which continually\\n', 'prevail on the coast of Guinea, while, in the end, it is found to be the\\n', 'shortest track, as westerly winds are never wanting afterward by which\\n', 'to reach the Cape. It was Captain Guy’s intention to make his first\\n', 'day we were picked up the schooner was off Cape St. Roque, in longitude\\n', 'thirty-one degrees west; so that, when found, we had drifted probably,\\n', 'from north to south, _not less than five-and-twenty degrees!_\\n', '\\n', 'On board the Jane Guy we were treated with all the kindness our\\n', 'distressed situation demanded. In about a fortnight, during which time\\n', 'we continued steering to the southeast, with gentle breezes and fine\\n', 'weather, both Peters and myself recovered entirely from the effects of\\n', 'our late privation and dreadful sufferings, and we began to remember\\n', 'what had passed rather as a frightful dream from which we had been\\n', 'happily awakened, than as events which had taken place in sober and\\n', 'is usually brought about by sudden transition, whether from joy\\n', 'to sorrow or from sorrow to joy--the degree of forgetfulness being\\n', 'proportioned to the degree of difference in the exchange. Thus, in my\\n', 'incidents are remembered, but not the feelings which the incidents\\n', 'agony.\\n', '\\n', 'We continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of\\n', 'greater moment than the occasional meeting with whaling-ships, and more\\n', 'frequently with the black or right whale, so called in contradistinction\\n', 'to the spermaceti. These, however, were chiefly found south of the\\n', 'twenty-fifth parallel. On the sixteenth of September, being in the\\n', 'vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope, the schooner encountered her first\\n', 'gale of any violence since leaving Liverpool. In this neighborhood, but\\n', 'more frequently to the south and east of the promontory (we were to\\n', 'the westward), navigators have often to contend with storms from the\\n', 'northward, which rage with great fury. They always bring with them a\\n', 'heavy sea, and one of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous\\n', 'chopping round of the wind, an occurrence almost certain to take place\\n', 'blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast, and in the next\\n', 'not a breath of wind will be felt in that direction, while from\\n', 'the southwest it will come out all at once with a violence almost\\n', 'the change, and vessels are thus enabled to take the proper precautions.\\n', '\\n', 'It was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a white\\n', 'squall, and, as usual, from the northward. By eight it had increased\\n', 'had then ever beheld. Every thing had been made as snug as possible,\\n', 'but the schooner laboured excessively, and gave evidence of her bad\\n', 'qualities as a seaboat, pitching her forecastle under at every plunge\\n', 'and with the greatest difficulty struggling up from one wave before she\\n', 'was buried in another. Just before sunset the bright spot for which we\\n', 'had been on the look-out made its appearance in the southwest, and in\\n', 'an hour afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping\\n', 'listlessly against the mast. In two minutes more, in spite of every\\n', 'preparation, we were hurled on our beam-ends, as if by magic, and a\\n', 'perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over us as we lay. The\\n', 'blow from the southwest, however, luckily proved to be nothing more than\\n', 'a squall, and we had the good fortune to right the vessel without the\\n', 'after this, but toward morning we found ourselves in nearly as good\\n', 'condition as before the gale. Captain Guy considered that he had made an\\n', 'escape little less than miraculous.\\n', '\\n', 'On the thirteenth of October we came in sight of Prince Edward’s Island,\\n', 'afterward we found ourselves near Possession Island, and presently\\n', 'Island, in the Southern Indian Ocean, and came to anchor in Christmas\\n', 'Harbour, having four fathoms of water.\\n', '\\n', 'This island, or rather group of islands, bears southeast from the Cape\\n', 'of Good Hope, and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred leagues. It\\n', 'was first discovered in 1772, by the Baron de Kergulen, or Kerguelen,\\n', 'a Frenchman, who, thinking the land to form a portion of an extensive\\n', 'southern continent carried home information to that effect, which\\n', 'produced much excitement at the time. The government, taking the matter\\n', 'up, sent the baron back in the following year for the purpose of\\n', 'giving his new discovery a critical examination, when the mistake was\\n', 'discovered. In 1777, Captain Cook fell in with the same group, and gave\\n', 'to the principal one the name of Desolation Island, a title which\\n', 'it certainly well deserves. Upon approaching the land, however, the\\n', 'navigator might be induced to suppose otherwise, as the sides of most\\n', 'of the hills, from September to March, are clothed with very brilliant\\n', 'verdure. This deceitful appearance is caused by a small plant resembling\\n', 'saxifrage, which is abundant, growing in large patches on a species\\n', 'of crumbling moss. Besides this plant there is scarcely a sign of\\n', 'vegetation on the island, if we except some coarse rank grass near the\\n', 'harbor, some lichen, and a shrub which bears resemblance to a cabbage\\n', 'shooting into seed, and which has a bitter and acrid taste.\\n', '\\n', 'The face of the country is hilly, although none of the hills can be\\n', 'called lofty. Their tops are perpetually covered with snow. There are\\n', 'several harbors, of which Christmas Harbour is the most convenient. It\\n', 'is the first to be met with on the northeast side of the island after\\n', 'passing Cape Francois, which forms the northern shore, and, by its\\n', 'peculiar shape, serves to distinguish the harbour. Its projecting point\\n', 'terminates in a high rock, through which is a large hole, forming a\\n', 'shelter of several small islands, which form a sufficient protection\\n', 'from all easterly winds. Proceeding on eastwardly from this anchorage\\n', 'you come to Wasp Bay, at the head of the harbour. This is a small basin,\\n', 'completely landlocked, into which you can go with four fathoms, and find\\n', 'here with her best bower ahead all the year round without risk. To the\\n', 'westward, at the head of Wasp Bay, is a small stream of excellent water,\\n', 'easily procured.\\n', '\\n', 'Some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on\\n', 'Kerguelen’s Island, and sea elephants abound. The feathered tribes are\\n', 'discovered in great numbers. Penguins are very plenty, and of these\\n', 'there are four different kinds. The royal penguin, so called from its\\n', 'size and beautiful plumage, is the largest. The upper part of the body\\n', 'is usually gray, sometimes of a lilac tint; the under portion of the\\n', 'purest white imaginable. The head is of a glossy and most brilliant\\n', 'black, the feet also. The chief beauty of plumage, however, consists in\\n', 'two broad stripes of a gold color, which pass along from the head to the\\n', 'breast. The bill is long, and either pink or bright scarlet. These birds\\n', 'walk erect; with a stately carriage. They carry their heads high with\\n', 'their wings drooping like two arms, and, as their tails project from\\n', 'their body in a line with the legs, the resemblance to a human figure\\n', 'is very striking, and would be apt to deceive the spectator at a casual\\n', 'glance or in the gloom of the evening. The royal penguins which we met\\n', 'with on Kerguelen’s Land were rather larger than a goose. The other\\n', 'kinds are the macaroni, the jackass, and the rookery penguin. These\\n', 'are much smaller, less beautiful in plumage, and different in other\\n', 'respects.\\n', '\\n', 'Besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found, among which\\n', 'may be mentioned sea-hens, blue peterels, teal, ducks, Port Egmont hens,\\n', 'shags, Cape pigeons, the nelly, sea swallows, terns, sea gulls, Mother\\n', 'Carey’s chickens, Mother Carey’s geese, or the great peterel, and,\\n', 'lastly, the albatross.\\n', '\\n', 'The great peterel is as large as the common albatross, and is\\n', 'carnivorous. It is frequently called the break-bones, or osprey peterel.\\n', 'They are not at all shy, and, when properly cooked, are palatable food.\\n', 'In flying they sometimes sail very close to the surface of the water,\\n', 'with the wings expanded, without appearing to move them in the least\\n', 'degree, or make any exertion with them whatever.\\n', '\\n', 'The albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the South Sea birds.\\n', 'It is of the gull species, and takes its prey on the wing, never coming\\n', 'on land except for the purpose of breeding. Between this bird and the\\n', 'penguin the most singular friendship exists. Their nests are\\n', 'constructed with great uniformity upon a plan concerted between the two\\n', 'species--that of the albatross being placed in the centre of a little\\n', 'square formed by the nests of four penguins. Navigators have agreed in\\n', 'calling an assemblage of such encampments a rookery. These rookeries\\n', 'have been often described, but as my readers may not all have seen these\\n', 'penguin and albatross, it will not be amiss to say something here of\\n', 'their mode of building and living.\\n', '\\n', 'When the season for incubation arrives, the birds assemble in vast\\n', 'numbers, and for some days appear to be deliberating upon the proper\\n', 'ground is selected, of suitable extent, usually comprising three or four\\n', 'acres, and situated as near the sea as possible, being still beyond its\\n', 'reach. The spot is chosen with reference to its evenness of surface, and\\n', 'that is preferred which is the least encumbered with stones. This\\n', 'matter being arranged, the birds proceed, with one accord, and actuated\\n', 'apparently by one mind, to trace out, with mathematical accuracy, either\\n', 'a square or other parallelogram, as may best suit the nature of the\\n', 'ground, and of just sufficient size to accommodate easily all the birds\\n', 'assembled, and no more--in this particular seeming determined upon\\n', 'preventing the access of future stragglers who have not participated in\\n', 'the labor of the encampment. One side of the place thus marked out runs\\n', 'parallel with the water’s edge, and is left open for ingress or egress.\\n', '\\n', 'Having defined the limits of the rookery, the colony now begin to clear\\n', 'it of every species of rubbish, picking up stone by stone, and carrying\\n', 'them outside of the lines, and close by them, so as to form a wall on\\n', 'the three inland sides. Just within this wall a perfectly level and\\n', 'smooth walk is formed, from six to eight feet wide, and extending around\\n', 'the encampment--thus serving the purpose of a general promenade.\\n', '\\n', 'The next process is to partition out the whole area into small squares\\n', 'exactly equal in size. This is done by forming narrow paths, very\\n', 'smooth, and crossing each other at right angles throughout the entire\\n', 'extent of the rookery. At each intersection of these paths the nest of\\n', 'an albatross is constructed, and a penguin’s nest in the centre of each\\n', 'square--thus every penguin is surrounded by four albatrosses, and each\\n', 'albatross by a like number of penguins. The penguin’s nest consists of a\\n', 'hole in the earth, very shallow, being only just of sufficient depth to\\n', 'keep her single egg from rolling. The albatross is somewhat less simple\\n', 'in her arrangements, erecting a hillock about a foot high and two in\\n', 'diameter. This is made of earth, seaweed, and shells. On its summit she\\n', 'builds her nest.\\n', '\\n', 'The birds take especial care never to leave their nests unoccupied for\\n', 'an instant during the period of incubation, or, indeed, until the young\\n', 'progeny are sufficiently strong to take care of themselves. While the\\n', 'male is absent at sea in search of food, the female remains on duty, and\\n', 'it is only upon the return of her partner that she ventures abroad. The\\n', 'eggs are never left uncovered at all--while one bird leaves the nest the\\n', 'other nestling in by its side. This precaution is rendered necessary\\n', 'by the thieving propensities prevalent in the rookery, the inhabitants\\n', 'making no scruple to purloin each other’s eggs at every good\\n', 'opportunity.\\n', '\\n', 'Although there are some rookeries in which the penguin and albatross are\\n', 'the sole population, yet in most of them a variety of oceanic birds\\n', 'are to be met with, enjoying all the privileges of citizenship, and\\n', 'scattering their nests here and there, wherever they can find room,\\n', 'never interfering, however, with the stations of the larger species.\\n', 'The appearance of such encampments, when seen from a distance, is\\n', 'exceedingly singular. The whole atmosphere just above the settlement\\n', 'is darkened with the immense number of the albatross (mingled with the\\n', 'smaller tribes) which are continually hovering over it, either going to\\n', 'the ocean or returning home. At the same time a crowd of penguins are\\n', 'to be observed, some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys, and some\\n', 'marching with the military strut so peculiar to them, around the general\\n', 'promenade ground which encircles the rookery. In short, survey it as\\n', 'we will, nothing can be more astonishing than the spirit of reflection\\n', 'evinced by these feathered beings, and nothing surely can be better\\n', 'calculated to elicit reflection in every well-regulated human intellect.\\n', '\\n', 'On the morning after our arrival in Christmas Harbour the chief mate,\\n', 'Mr. Patterson, took the boats, and (although it was somewhat early in\\n', 'the season) went in search of seal, leaving the captain and a young\\n', 'relation of his on a point of barren land to the westward, they having\\n', 'interior of the island. Captain Guy took with him a bottle, in which was\\n', 'a sealed letter, and made his way from the point on which he was set on\\n', 'shore toward one of the highest peaks in the place. It is probable that\\n', 'his design was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel\\n', 'which he expected to come after him. As soon as we lost sight of him\\n', 'we proceeded (Peters and myself being in the mate’s boat) on our cruise\\n', 'around the coast, looking for seal. In this business we were occupied\\n', 'about three weeks, examining with great care every nook and corner,\\n', 'not only of Kerguelen’s Land, but of the several small islands in the\\n', 'vicinity. Our labours, however, were not crowned with any important\\n', 'success. We saw a great many fur seal, but they were exceedingly shy,\\n', 'and with the greatest exertions, we could only procure three hundred\\n', 'and fifty skins in all. Sea elephants were abundant, especially on the\\n', 'western coast of the mainland, but of these we killed only twenty, and\\n', 'this with great difficulty. On the smaller islands we discovered a\\n', 'good many of the hair seal, but did not molest them. We returned to the\\n', 'schooner on the eleventh, where we found Captain Guy and his nephew,\\n', 'who gave a very bad account of the interior, representing it as one\\n', 'of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in the world. They had\\n', 'remained two nights on the island, owing to some misunderstanding, on\\n', 'the part of the second mate, in regard to the sending a jollyboat from\\n', 'the schooner to take them off.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'the westward, and leaving Marion’s Island, one of Crozet’s group, on the\\n', 'larboard. We afterward passed Prince Edward’s Island, leaving it also on\\n', 'our left, then, steering more to the northward, made, in fifteen days,\\n', '\\n', 'This group, now so well known, and which consists of three circular\\n', 'islands, was first discovered by the Portuguese, and was visited\\n', 'afterward by the Dutch in 1643, and by the French in 1767. The three\\n', 'islands together form a triangle, and are distant from each other about\\n', 'ten miles, there being fine open passages between. The land in all of\\n', 'them is very high, especially in Tristan d’Acunha, properly so called.\\n', 'This is the largest of the group, being fifteen miles in circumference,\\n', 'and so elevated that it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of\\n', 'height extends back nearly to the centre of the island, and from this\\n', 'tableland arises a lofty cone like that of Teneriffe. The lower half of\\n', 'this cone is clothed with trees of good size, but the upper region is\\n', 'barren rock, usually hidden among the clouds, and covered with snow\\n', 'during the greater part of the year. There are no shoals or other\\n', 'dangers about the island, the shores being remarkably bold and the water\\n', 'deep. On the northwestern coast is a bay, with a beach of black sand\\n', 'where a landing with boats can be easily effected, provided there be a\\n', 'southerly wind. Plenty of excellent water may here be readily procured;\\n', 'also cod and other fish may be taken with hook and line.\\n', '\\n', 'The next island in point of size, and the most westwardly of the group,\\n', 'is that called the Inaccessible. Its precise situation is 37 degrees 17’\\n', 'circumference, and on all sides presents a forbidding and precipitous\\n', 'aspect. Its top is perfectly flat, and the whole region is sterile,\\n', 'nothing growing upon it except a few stunted shrubs.\\n', '\\n', 'Nightingale Island, the smallest and most southerly, is in latitude 37\\n', 'is a high ledge of rocky islets; a few also of a similar appearance are\\n', 'seen to the northeast. The ground is irregular and sterile, and a deep\\n', 'valley partially separates it.\\n', '\\n', 'The shores of these islands abound, in the proper season, with sea\\n', 'lions, sea elephants, the hair and fur seal, together with a great\\n', 'variety of oceanic birds. Whales are also plenty in their vicinity.\\n', 'Owing to the ease with which these various animals were here formerly\\n', 'taken, the group has been much visited since its discovery. The Dutch\\n', 'and French frequented it at a very early period. In 1790, Captain\\n', 'Patten, of the ship Industry, of Philadelphia, made Tristan d’Acunha,\\n', 'where he remained seven months (from August, 1790, to April, 1791) for\\n', 'the purpose of collecting sealskins. In this time he gathered no less\\n', 'than five thousand six hundred, and says that he would have had no\\n', 'difficulty in loading a large ship with oil in three weeks. Upon his\\n', 'arrival he found no quadrupeds, with the exception of a few wild goats;\\n', 'the island now abounds with all our most valuable domestic animals,\\n', 'which have been introduced by subsequent navigators.\\n', '\\n', 'Colquhoun, of the American brig Betsey, touched at the largest of the\\n', 'islands for the purpose of refreshment. He planted onions, potatoes,\\n', 'cabbages, and a great many other vegetables, an abundance of all which\\n', 'is now to be met with.\\n', '\\n', 'In 1811, a Captain Haywood, in the Nereus, visited Tristan. He found\\n', 'there three Americans, who were residing upon the island to prepare\\n', 'sealskins and oil. One of these men was named Jonathan Lambert, and\\n', 'he called himself the sovereign of the country. He had cleared and\\n', 'cultivated about sixty acres of land, and turned his attention to\\n', 'raising the coffee-plant and sugar-cane, with which he had been\\n', 'furnished by the American Minister at Rio Janeiro. This settlement,\\n', 'however, was finally abandoned, and in 1817 the islands were taken\\n', 'possession of by the British Government, who sent a detachment for that\\n', 'purpose from the Cape of Good Hope. They did not, however, retain them\\n', 'long; but, upon the evacuation of the country as a British possession,\\n', 'two or three English families took up their residence there\\n', 'independently of the Government. On the twenty-fifth of March, 1824, the\\n', 'Berwick, Captain Jeffrey, from London to Van Diemen’s Land, arrived at\\n', 'the place, where they found an Englishman of the name of Glass, formerly\\n', 'a corporal in the British artillery. He claimed to be supreme governor\\n', 'of the islands, and had under his control twenty-one men and three\\n', 'women. He gave a very favourable account of the salubrity of the\\n', 'climate and of the productiveness of the soil. The population occupied\\n', 'themselves chiefly in collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil,\\n', 'with which they traded to the Cape of Good Hope, Glass owning a\\n', 'small schooner. At the period of our arrival the governor was still a\\n', 'resident, but his little community had multiplied, there being\\n', 'fifty-six persons upon Tristan, besides a smaller settlement of seven on\\n', 'Nightingale Island. We had no difficulty in procuring almost every\\n', 'kind of refreshment which we required--sheep, hogs, bullocks, rabbits,\\n', 'poultry, goats, fish in great variety, and vegetables were abundant.\\n', 'Having come to anchor close in with the large island, in eighteen\\n', 'fathoms, we took all we wanted on board very conveniently. Captain\\n', 'Guy also purchased of Glass five hundred sealskins and some ivory. We\\n', 'remained here a week, during which the prevailing winds were from the\\n', 'northward and westward, and the weather somewhat hazy. On the fifth of\\n', 'November we made sail to the southward and westward, with the intention\\n', 'of having a thorough search for a group of islands called the Auroras,\\n', 'respecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has existed.\\n', '\\n', 'These islands are said to have been discovered as early as 1762, by the\\n', 'commander of the ship Aurora. In 1790, Captain Manuel de Oyarvido, in\\n', 'the ship Princess, belonging to the Royal Philippine Company, sailed, as\\n', 'he asserts, directly among them. In 1794, the Spanish corvette Atrevida\\n', 'went with the determination of ascertaining their precise situation,\\n', 'and, in a paper published by the Royal Hydrographical Society of\\n', 'Madrid in the year 1809, the following language is used respecting\\n', 'this expedition: “The corvette Atrevida practised, in their immediate\\n', 'vicinity, from the twenty-first to the twenty-seventh of January, all\\n', 'the necessary observations, and measured by chronometers the difference\\n', 'of longitude between these islands and the port of Soledad in the\\n', 'Manillas. The islands are three, they are very nearly in the same\\n', 'meridian; the centre one is rather low, and the other two may be seen\\n', 'at nine leagues’ distance.” The observations made on board the Atrevida\\n', 'give the following results as the precise situation of each island.\\n', '\\n', 'On the twenty-seventh of January, 1820, Captain James Weddel, of the\\n', 'British navy, sailed from Staten Land also in search of the Auroras. He\\n', 'reports that, having made the most diligent search and passed not only\\n', 'immediately over the spots indicated by the commander of the Atrevida,\\n', 'but in every direction throughout the vicinity of these spots, he\\n', 'could discover no indication of land. These conflicting statements have\\n', 'induced other navigators to look out for the islands; and, strange to\\n', 'say, while some have sailed through every inch of sea where they are\\n', 'supposed to lie without finding them, there have been not a few who\\n', 'declare positively that they have seen them; and even been close in\\n', 'with their shores. It was Captain Guy’s intention to make every exertion\\n', '\\n', 'We kept on our course, between the south and west, with variable\\n', 'weather, until the twentieth of the month, when we found ourselves on\\n', 'the situation of the most southern of the group. Not perceiving any sign\\n', 'of land, we continued to the westward of the parallel of fifty-three\\n', 'degrees south, as far as the meridian of fifty degrees west. We then\\n', 'stood to the north as far as the parallel of fifty-two degrees south,\\n', 'when we turned to the eastward, and kept our parallel by double\\n', 'altitudes, morning and evening, and meridian altitudes of the planets\\n', 'and moon. Having thus gone eastwardly to the meridian of the western\\n', 'coast of Georgia, we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude\\n', 'from which we set out. We then took diagonal courses throughout the\\n', 'entire extent of sea circumscribed, keeping a lookout constantly at the\\n', 'masthead, and repeating our examination with the greatest care for a\\n', 'period of three weeks, during which the weather was remarkably pleasant\\n', 'and fair, with no haze whatsoever. Of course we were thoroughly\\n', 'satisfied that, whatever islands might have existed in this vicinity at\\n', 'any former period, no vestige of them remained at the present day. Since\\n', 'care, in 1822, by Captain Johnson, of the American schooner Henry, and\\n', 'by Captain Morrell in the American schooner Wasp--in both cases with the\\n', 'same result as in our own.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'It had been Captain Guy’s original intention, after satisfying himself\\n', 'about the Auroras, to proceed through the Strait of Magellan, and\\n', 'up along the western coast of Patagonia; but information received at\\n', 'Tristan d’Acunha induced him to steer to the southward, in the hope of\\n', 'falling in with some small islands said to lie about the parallel of\\n', 'not discovering these lands, he designed, should the season prove\\n', 'favourable, to push on toward the pole. Accordingly, on the twelfth of\\n', 'December, we made sail in that direction. On the eighteenth we found\\n', 'ourselves about the station indicated by Glass, and cruised for three\\n', 'days in that neighborhood without finding any traces of the islands\\n', 'he had mentioned. On the twenty-first, the weather being unusually\\n', 'pleasant, we again made sail to the southward, with the resolution of\\n', 'penetrating in that course as far as possible. Before entering upon this\\n', 'portion of my narrative, it may be as well, for the information of those\\n', 'readers who have paid little attention to the progress of discovery in\\n', 'these regions, to give some brief account of the very few attempts at\\n', 'reaching the southern pole which have hitherto been made.\\n', '\\n', 'That of Captain Cook was the first of which we have any distinct\\n', 'account. In 1772 he sailed to the south in the Resolution, accompanied\\n', 'by Lieutenant Furneaux in the Adventure. In December he found himself as\\n', 'far as the fifty-eighth parallel of south latitude, and in longitude 26\\n', 'inches thick, and running northwest and southeast. This ice was in large\\n', 'cakes, and usually it was packed so closely that the vessel had great\\n', 'difficulty in forcing a passage. At this period Captain Cook supposed,\\n', 'from the vast number of birds to be seen, and from other indications,\\n', 'that he was in the near vicinity of land. He kept on to the southward,\\n', 'the weather being exceedingly cold, until he reached the sixty-fourth\\n', 'gentle breezes, for five days, the thermometer being at thirty-six. In\\n', 'January, 1773, the vessels crossed the Antarctic circle, but did not\\n', 'succeed in penetrating much farther; for upon reaching latitude 67\\n', 'degrees 15’ they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body\\n', 'of ice, extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye could\\n', 'reach. This ice was of every variety--and some large floes of it, miles\\n', 'in extent, formed a compact mass, rising eighteen or twenty feet above\\n', 'the water. It being late in the season, and no hope entertained of\\n', 'rounding these obstructions, Captain Cook now reluctantly turned to the\\n', 'northward.\\n', '\\n', 'In the November following he renewed his search in the Antarctic. In\\n', 'latitude 59 degrees 40’ he met with a strong current setting to the\\n', 'southward. In December, when the vessels were in latitude 67 degrees\\n', 'gales and fog. Here also birds were abundant; the albatross, the\\n', 'penguin, and the peterel especially. In latitude 70 degrees 23’ some\\n', 'large islands of ice were encountered, and shortly afterward the clouds\\n', 'to the southward were observed to be of a snowy whiteness, indicating\\n', 'the vicinity of field ice. In latitude 71 degrees 10’, longitude 106\\n', 'frozen expanse, which filled the whole area of the southern horizon. The\\n', 'northern edge of this expanse was ragged and broken, so firmly wedged\\n', 'together as to be utterly impassible, and extending about a mile to the\\n', 'southward. Behind it the frozen surface was comparatively smooth for\\n', 'some distance, until terminated in the extreme background by gigantic\\n', 'ranges of ice mountains, the one towering above the other. Captain Cook\\n', 'concluded that this vast field reached the southern pole or was\\n', 'perseverance have at length succeeded in getting set on foot a national\\n', 'expedition, partly for the purpose of exploring these regions, thus\\n', 'speaks of the attempt of the Resolution. “We are not surprised that\\n', 'Captain Cook was unable to go beyond 71 degrees 10’, but we are\\n', 'astonished that he did attain that point on the meridian of 106 degrees\\n', '54’ west longitude. Palmer’s Land lies south of the Shetland, latitude\\n', 'sixty-four degrees, and tends to the southward and westward farther than\\n', 'any navigator has yet penetrated. Cook was standing for this land when\\n', 'his progress was arrested by the ice; which, we apprehend, must always\\n', 'be the case in that point, and so early in the season as the sixth\\n', 'of January--and we should not be surprised if a portion of the icy\\n', 'mountains described was attached to the main body of Palmer’s Land,\\n', 'or to some other portions of land lying farther to the southward and\\n', 'westward.”\\n', '\\n', 'In 1803, Captains Kreutzenstern and Lisiausky were dispatched by\\n', 'Alexander of Russia for the purpose of circumnavigating the globe. In\\n', 'endeavouring to get south, they made no farther than 59 degrees 58’, in\\n', 'eastwardly. Whales were abundant, but they saw no ice. In regard to this\\n', 'voyage, Mr. Reynolds observes that, if Kreutzenstern had arrived where\\n', 'he did earlier in the season, he must have encountered ice--it was March\\n', 'when he reached the latitude specified. The winds, prevailing, as they\\n', 'do, from the southward and westward, had carried the floes, aided by\\n', 'currents, into that icy region bounded on the north by Georgia, east\\n', 'by Sandwich Land and the South Orkneys, and west by the South Shetland\\n', 'islands.\\n', '\\n', 'In 1822, Captain James Weddell, of the British navy, with two very small\\n', 'vessels, penetrated farther to the south than any previous navigator,\\n', 'and this, too, without encountering extraordinary difficulties.

On the first of February he found himself in\\n', 'passage is extracted from his journal of that date. “The wind soon\\n', 'freshened to an eleven-knot breeze, and we embraced this opportunity\\n', 'of making to the west; being however convinced that the farther we\\n', 'went south beyond latitude sixty-four degrees, the less ice was to be\\n', 'apprehended, we steered a little to the southward, until we crossed\\n', 'latitude there was no field ice, and very few ice islands in sight.”\\n', '\\n', 'now entirely free of field ice, and there were not more than a dozen ice\\n', 'islands in sight. At the same time the temperature of the air and water\\n', 'was at least thirteen degrees higher (more mild) than we had ever found\\n', 'it between the parallels of sixty and sixty-two south. We were now\\n', 'have several times passed within the Antarctic circle, on different\\n', 'meridians, and have uniformly found the temperature, both of the air and\\n', 'the sixty-fifth degree of south latitude, and that the variation\\n', 'decreases in the same proportion. While north of this latitude, say\\n', 'between sixty and sixty-five south, we frequently had great difficulty\\n', 'in finding a passage for the vessel between the immense and almost\\n', 'innumerable ice islands, some of which were from one to two miles in\\n', 'circumference, and more than five hundred feet above the surface of the\\n', 'water.”\\n', '\\n', 'Being nearly destitute of fuel and water, and without proper\\n', 'instruments, it being also late in the season, Captain Morrell was now\\n', 'obliged to put back, without attempting any further progress to the\\n', 'westward, although an entirely open, sea lay before him. He expresses\\n', 'the opinion that, had not these overruling considerations obliged him to\\n', 'retreat, he could have penetrated, if not to the pole itself, at least\\n', 'matters somewhat at length, that the reader may have an opportunity of\\n', 'seeing how far they were borne out by my own subsequent experience.\\n', '\\n', 'In 1831, Captain Briscoe, in the employ of the Messieurs Enderby,\\n', 'whale-ship owners of London, sailed in the brig Lively for the South\\n', 'Seas, accompanied by the cutter Tula. On the twenty-eighth of February,\\n', 'descried land, and “clearly discovered through the snow the black\\n', 'neighbourhood during the whole of the following month, but was unable\\n', 'to approach the coast nearer than within ten leagues, owing to the\\n', 'boisterous state of the weather. Finding it impossible to make further\\n', 'discovery during this season, he returned northward to winter in Van\\n', 'Diemen’s Land.\\n', '\\n', 'In the beginning of 1832 he again proceeded southwardly, and on the\\n', 'fourth of February land was seen to the southeast in latitude 67 degrees 15’\\n', 'headland of the country he had first discovered. On the twenty-first of\\n', 'the month he succeeded in landing on the latter, and took possession of\\n', 'of the English queen. These particulars being made known to the Royal\\n', 'Geographical Society of London, the conclusion was drawn by that body\\n', '“that there is a continuous tract of land extending from 47 degrees\\n', 'sixty-six to sixty-seven degrees south latitude.” In respect to this\\n', 'conclusion Mr. Reynolds observes: “In the correctness of it we by\\n', 'no means concur; nor do the discoveries of Briscoe warrant any such\\n', 'indifference. It was within these limits that Weddel proceeded south on\\n', 'a meridian to the east of Georgia, Sandwich Land, and the South Orkney\\n', 'and Shetland islands.” My own experience will be found to testify most\\n', 'directly to the falsity of the conclusion arrived at by the society.\\n', '\\n', 'These are the principal attempts which have been made at penetrating to\\n', 'a high southern latitude, and it will now be seen that there remained,\\n', 'previous to the voyage of the Jane, nearly three hundred degrees of\\n', 'longitude in which the Antarctic circle had not been crossed at all.\\n', 'Of course a wide field lay before us for discovery, and it was with\\n', 'resolution of pushing boldly to the southward.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'We kept our course southwardly for four days after giving up the\\n', 'search for Glass’s islands, without meeting with any ice at all. On the\\n', 'field ice, not, however, of any great extent. The winds generally blew\\n', 'from the southeast, or the northeast, but were very light. Whenever we\\n', 'had a westerly wind, which was seldom, it was invariably attended with a\\n', 'rain squall. Every day we had more or less snow. The thermometer, on the\\n', 'twenty-seventh stood at thirty-five.\\n', '\\n', 'January 1, 1828.--This day we found ourselves completely hemmed in by\\n', 'during the whole forenoon, from the northeast, and drove large cakes of\\n', 'the drift against the rudder and counter with such violence that we all\\n', 'trembled for the consequences. Toward evening, the gale still blowing\\n', 'with fury, a large field in front separated, and we were enabled, by\\n', 'carrying a press of sail to force a passage through the smaller flakes\\n', 'into some open water beyond. As we approached this space we took in sail\\n', 'by degrees, and having at length got clear, lay-to under a single reefed\\n', 'foresail.\\n', '\\n', 'January 2.--We had now tolerably pleasant weather. At noon we found\\n', 'having crossed the Antarctic circle. Very little ice was to be seen to\\n', 'the southward, although large fields of it lay behind us. This day we\\n', 'rigged some sounding gear, using a large iron pot capable of holding\\n', 'twenty gallons, and a line of two hundred fathoms. We found the\\n', 'current setting to the north, about a quarter of a mile per hour. The\\n', 'temperature of the air was now about thirty-three. Here we found the\\n', 'variation to be 14 degrees 28’ easterly, per azimuth.\\n', '\\n', 'January 5.--We had still held on to the southward without any very great\\n', 'impediments. On this morning, however, being in latitude 73 degrees 15’\\n', 'immense expanse of firm ice. We saw, nevertheless, much open water to\\n', 'the southward, and felt no doubt of being able to reach it eventually.\\n', 'Standing to the eastward along the edge of the floe, we at length came\\n', 'to a passage of about a mile in width, through which we warped our way\\n', 'by sundown. The sea in which we now were was thickly covered with ice\\n', 'islands, but had no field ice, and we pushed on boldly as before. The\\n', 'cold did not seem to increase, although we had snow very frequently,\\n', 'and now and then hail squalls of great violence. Immense flocks of\\n', 'the albatross flew over the schooner this day, going from southeast to\\n', 'northwest.\\n', '\\n', 'January 7.--The sea still remained pretty well open, so that we had\\n', 'no difficulty in holding on our course. To the westward we saw some\\n', 'icebergs of incredible size, and in the afternoon passed very near one\\n', 'whose summit could not have been less than four hundred fathoms from\\n', 'the surface of the ocean. Its girth was probably, at the base,\\n', 'three-quarters of a league, and several streams of water were running\\n', 'from crevices in its sides. We remained in sight of this island two\\n', 'days, and then only lost it in a fog.\\n', '\\n', 'January 10.--Early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a man\\n', 'overboard. He was an American named Peter Vredenburgh, a native of New\\n', 'York, and was one of the most valuable hands on board the schooner. In\\n', 'going over the bows his foot slipped, and he fell between two cakes\\n', 'of ice, never rising again. At noon of this day we were in latitude 78\\n', 'we had hail squalls continually from the northward and eastward. In\\n', 'this direction also we saw several more immense icebergs, and the whole\\n', 'horizon to the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice, rising\\n', 'in tiers, one mass above the other. Some driftwood floated by during\\n', 'the evening, and a great quantity of birds flew over, among which were\\n', 'nellies, peterels, albatrosses, and a large bird of a brilliant blue\\n', 'plumage. The variation here, per azimuth, was less than it had been\\n', 'previously to our passing the Antarctic circle.\\n', '\\n', 'January 12.--Our passage to the south again looked doubtful, as nothing\\n', 'was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one apparently limitless\\n', 'floe, backed by absolute mountains of ragged ice, one precipice of which\\n', 'arose frowningly above the other. We stood to the westward until the\\n', 'fourteenth, in the hope of finding an entrance.\\n', '\\n', 'January 14.--This morning we reached the western extremity of the field\\n', 'which had impeded us, and, weathering it, came to an open sea, without a\\n', 'particle of ice. Upon sounding with two hundred fathoms, we here found\\n', 'a current setting southwardly at the rate of half a mile per hour. The\\n', 'temperature of the air was forty-seven, that of the water thirty-four. We\\n', 'now sailed to the southward without meeting any interruption of moment\\n', 'until the sixteenth, when, at noon, we were in latitude 81 degrees\\n', 'setting still southwardly, and at the rate of three quarters of a mile\\n', 'per hour. The variation per azimuth had diminished, and the temperature\\n', 'of the air was mild and pleasant, the thermometer being as high as\\n', 'fifty-one. At this period not a particle of ice was to be discovered.\\n', 'All hands on board now felt certain of attaining the pole.\\n', '\\n', 'January 17.--This day was full of incident. Innumerable flights of birds\\n', 'flew over us from the southward, and several were shot from the deck,\\n', 'one of them, a species of pelican, proved to be excellent eating. About\\n', 'midday a small floe of ice was seen from the masthead off the larboard\\n', 'bow, and upon it there appeared to be some large animal. As the weather\\n', 'was good and nearly calm, Captain Guy ordered out two of the boats to\\n', 'see what it was. Dirk Peters and myself accompanied the mate in the\\n', 'larger boat. Upon coming up with the floe, we perceived that it was in\\n', 'the possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the Arctic bear,\\n', 'but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals. Being well\\n', 'armed, we made no scruple of attacking it at once. Several shots were\\n', 'fired in quick succession, the most of which took effect, apparently,\\n', 'in the head and body. Nothing discouraged, however, the monster threw\\n', 'himself from the ice, and swam with open jaws, to the boat in which were\\n', 'Peters and myself. Owing to the confusion which ensued among us at this\\n', 'unexpected turn of the adventure, no person was ready immediately with\\n', 'a second shot, and the bear had actually succeeded in getting half his\\n', 'vast bulk across our gunwale, and seizing one of the men by the small\\n', 'of his back, before any efficient means were taken to repel him. In this\\n', 'extremity nothing but the promptness and agility of Peters saved us from\\n', 'destruction. Leaping upon the back of the huge beast, he plunged the\\n', 'blade of a knife behind the neck, reaching the spinal marrow at a blow.\\n', 'The brute tumbled into the sea lifeless, and without a struggle, rolling\\n', 'over Peters as he fell. The latter soon recovered himself, and a rope\\n', 'being thrown him, he secured the carcass before entering the boat. We\\n', 'then returned in triumph to the schooner, towing our trophy behind us.\\n', 'This bear, upon admeasurement, proved to be full fifteen feet in his\\n', 'greatest length. His wool was perfectly white, and very coarse, curling\\n', 'tightly. The eyes were of a blood red, and larger than those of the\\n', 'Arctic bear, the snout also more rounded, rather resembling the snout\\n', 'of the bulldog. The meat was tender, but excessively rank and fishy,\\n', 'although the men devoured it with avidity, and declared it excellent\\n', 'eating.\\n', '\\n', 'Scarcely had we got our prize alongside, when the man at the masthead\\n', 'gave the joyful shout of “land on the starboard bow!” All hands were\\n', 'now upon the alert, and, a breeze springing up very opportunely from the\\n', 'northward and eastward, we were soon close in with the coast. It\\n', 'proved to be a low rocky islet, of about a league in circumference, and\\n', 'altogether destitute of vegetation, if we except a species of prickly\\n', 'pear. In approaching it from the northward, a singular ledge of rock is\\n', 'seen projecting into the sea, and bearing a strong resemblance to corded\\n', 'bales of cotton. Around this ledge to the westward is a small bay, at\\n', 'the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient landing.\\n', '\\n', 'It did not take us long to explore every portion of the island, but,\\n', 'with one exception, we found nothing worthy of our observation. In the\\n', 'southern extremity, we picked up near the shore, half buried in a pile\\n', 'of loose stones, a piece of wood, which seemed to have formed the prow\\n', 'of a canoe. There had been evidently some attempt at carving upon it,\\n', 'and Captain Guy fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise, but\\n', 'the resemblance did not strike me very forcibly. Besides this prow, if\\n', 'such it were, we found no other token that any living creature had ever\\n', 'been here before. Around the coast we discovered occasional small floes\\n', 'of ice--but these were very few. The exact situation of the islet (to\\n', 'which Captain Guy gave the name of Bennet’s Islet, in honour of his\\n', '\\n', 'We had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees farther\\n', 'than any previous navigators, and the sea still lay perfectly open\\n', 'before us. We found, too, that the variation uniformly decreased as we\\n', 'proceeded, and, what was still more surprising, that the temperature\\n', 'of the air, and latterly of the water, became milder. The weather might\\n', 'even be called pleasant, and we had a steady but very gentle breeze\\n', 'always from some northern point of the compass. The sky was usually\\n', 'clear, with now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the\\n', 'southern horizon--this, however, was invariably of brief duration. Two\\n', 'difficulties alone presented themselves to our view; we were getting\\n', 'short of fuel, and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among several of\\n', 'the crew. These considerations began to impress upon Captain Guy the\\n', 'necessity of returning, and he spoke of it frequently. For my own part,\\n', 'the course we were pursuing, and having every reason to believe, from\\n', 'present appearances, that we should not find it the sterile soil met\\n', 'expediency of persevering, at least for a few days longer, in the\\n', 'direction we were now holding. So tempting an opportunity of solving\\n', 'the great problem in regard to an Antarctic continent had never yet\\n', 'indignation at the timid and ill-timed suggestions of our commander.\\n', 'this head had the effect of inducing him to push on. While, therefore,\\n', 'degree of gratification at having been instrumental, however remotely,\\n', 'in opening to the eye of science one of the most intensely exciting\\n', 'secrets which has ever engrossed its attention.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'January 18.--This morning {*4} we continued to the southward, with the\\n', 'same pleasant weather as before. The sea was entirely smooth, the air\\n', 'tolerably warm and from the northeast, the temperature of the water\\n', 'fifty-three. We now again got our sounding-gear in order, and, with a\\n', 'hundred and fifty fathoms of line, found the current setting toward\\n', 'the pole at the rate of a mile an hour. This constant tendency to\\n', 'the southward, both in the wind and current, caused some degree of\\n', 'speculation, and even of alarm, in different quarters of the schooner,\\n', 'mind of Captain Guy. He was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule, however,\\n', 'variation was now very trivial. In the course of the day we saw several\\n', 'large whales of the right species, and innumerable flights of the\\n', 'albatross passed over the vessel. We also picked up a bush, full of\\n', 'red berries, like those of the hawthorn, and the carcass of a\\n', 'singular-looking land-animal. It was three feet in length, and but six\\n', 'inches in height, with four very short legs, the feet armed with long\\n', 'claws of a brilliant scarlet, and resembling coral in substance. The\\n', 'body was covered with a straight silky hair, perfectly white. The tail\\n', 'was peaked like that of a rat, and about a foot and a half long. The\\n', 'head resembled a cat’s, with the exception of the ears--these were\\n', 'flopped like the ears of a dog. The teeth were of the same brilliant\\n', 'scarlet as the claws.\\n', '\\n', 'January 19.--To-day, being in latitude 83 degrees 20’, longitude 43\\n', 'again saw land from the masthead, and, upon a closer scrutiny, found it\\n', 'to be one of a group of very large islands. The shore was precipitous,\\n', 'and the interior seemed to be well wooded, a circumstance which\\n', 'occasioned us great joy. In about four hours from our first discovering\\n', 'the land we came to anchor in ten fathoms, sandy bottom, a league from\\n', 'the coast, as a high surf, with strong ripples here and there, rendered\\n', 'a nearer approach of doubtful expediency. The two largest boats were\\n', 'now ordered out, and a party, well armed (among whom were Peters and\\n', 'myself), proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which appeared to\\n', 'encircle the island. After searching about for some time, we discovered\\n', 'an inlet, which we were entering, when we saw four large canoes put off\\n', 'from the shore, filled with men who seemed to be well armed. We waited\\n', 'for them to come up, and, as they moved with great rapidity, they were\\n', 'soon within hail. Captain Guy now held up a white handkerchief on the\\n', 'blade of an oar, when the strangers made a full stop, and commenced\\n', 'a loud jabbering all at once, intermingled with occasional shouts, in\\n', 'which we could distinguish the words Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama! They\\n', 'continued this for at least half an hour, during which we had a good\\n', 'opportunity of observing their appearance.\\n', '\\n', 'In the four canoes, which might have been fifty feet long and five\\n', 'broad, there were a hundred and ten savages in all. They were about the\\n', 'ordinary stature of Europeans, but of a more muscular and brawny frame.\\n', 'Their complexion a jet black, with thick and long woolly hair. They were\\n', 'clothed in skins of an unknown black animal, shaggy and silky, and made\\n', 'to fit the body with some degree of skill, the hair being inside,\\n', 'except where turned out about the neck, wrists, and ankles. Their arms\\n', 'consisted principally of clubs, of a dark, and apparently very heavy\\n', 'wood. Some spears, however, were observed among them, headed with flint,\\n', 'and a few slings. The bottoms of the canoes were full of black stones\\n', 'about the size of a large egg.\\n', '\\n', 'When they had concluded their harangue (for it was clear they intended\\n', 'their jabbering for such), one of them who seemed to be the chief stood\\n', 'up in the prow of his canoe, and made signs for us to bring our boats\\n', 'alongside of him. This hint we pretended not to understand, thinking\\n', 'it the wiser plan to maintain, if possible, the interval between us, as\\n', 'their number more than quadrupled our own. Finding this to be the case,\\n', 'the chief ordered the three other canoes to hold back, while he advanced\\n', 'toward us with his own. As soon as he came up with us he leaped on board\\n', 'the largest of our boats, and seated himself by the side of Captain\\n', 'Guy, pointing at the same time to the schooner, and repeating the word\\n', 'Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama! We now put back to the vessel, the four\\n', 'canoes following at a little distance.\\n', '\\n', 'Upon getting alongside, the chief evinced symptoms of extreme surprise\\n', 'and delight, clapping his hands, slapping his thighs and breast, and\\n', 'laughing obstreperously. His followers behind joined in his merriment,\\n', 'and for some minutes the din was so excessive as to be absolutely\\n', 'deafening. Quiet being at length restored, Captain Guy ordered the boats\\n', 'to be hoisted up, as a necessary precaution, and gave the chief (whose\\n', 'name we soon found to be Too-wit) to understand that we could admit no\\n', 'more than twenty of his men on deck at one time. With this arrangement\\n', 'he appeared perfectly satisfied, and gave some directions to the canoes,\\n', 'when one of them approached, the rest remaining about fifty yards off.\\n', 'Twenty of the savages now got on board, and proceeded to ramble over\\n', 'every part of the deck, and scramble about among the rigging, making\\n', 'themselves much at home, and examining every article with great\\n', 'inquisitiveness.\\n', '\\n', 'It was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the white\\n', 'race--from whose complexion, indeed, they appeared to recoil. They\\n', 'believed the Jane to be a living creature, and seemed to be afraid of\\n', 'hurting it with the points of their spears, carefully turning them up.\\n', 'Our crew were much amused with the conduct of Too-wit in one instance.\\n', 'The cook was splitting some wood near the galley, and, by accident,\\n', 'struck his axe into the deck, making a gash of considerable depth.\\n', 'The chief immediately ran up, and pushing the cook on one side rather\\n', 'roughly, commenced a half whine, half howl, strongly indicative of\\n', 'sympathy in what he considered the sufferings of the schooner, patting\\n', 'and smoothing the gash with his hand, and washing it from a bucket of\\n', 'seawater which stood by. This was a degree of ignorance for which we\\n', 'affected.\\n', '\\n', 'When the visitors had satisfied, as well as they could, their curiosity\\n', 'in regard to our upper works, they were admitted below, when their\\n', 'amazement exceeded all bounds. Their astonishment now appeared to be far\\n', 'too deep for words, for they roamed about in silence, broken only by low\\n', 'ejaculations. The arms afforded them much food for speculation, and they\\n', 'that they had the least suspicion of their actual use, but rather took\\n', 'them for idols, seeing the care we had of them, and the attention with\\n', 'which we watched their movements while handling them. At the great guns\\n', 'their wonder was redoubled. They approached them with every mark of the\\n', 'profoundest reverence and awe, but forbore to examine them minutely.\\n', 'There were two large mirrors in the cabin, and here was the acme of\\n', 'their amazement. Too-wit was the first to approach them, and he had got\\n', 'in the middle of the cabin, with his face to one and his back to the\\n', 'other, before he fairly perceived them. Upon raising his eyes and seeing\\n', 'but, upon turning short round to make a retreat, and beholding himself a\\n', 'the spot. No persuasion could prevail upon him to take another look;\\n', 'throwing himself upon the floor, with his face buried in his hands, he\\n', 'remained thus until we were obliged to drag him upon deck.\\n', '\\n', 'The whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner, twenty\\n', 'at a time, Too-wit being suffered to remain during the entire period.\\n', 'We saw no disposition to thievery among them, nor did we miss a single\\n', 'article after their departure. Throughout the whole of their visit they\\n', 'evinced the most friendly manner. There were, however, some points in\\n', 'their demeanour which we found it impossible to understand; for example,\\n', 'we could not get them to approach several very harmless objects--such\\n', 'as the schooner’s sails, an egg, an open book, or a pan of flour. We\\n', 'endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any articles which might\\n', 'be turned to account in the way of traffic, but found great difficulty\\n', 'in being comprehended. We made out, nevertheless, what greatly\\n', 'astonished us, that the islands abounded in the large tortoise of the\\n', 'Gallipagos, one of which we saw in the canoe of Too-wit. We saw also\\n', 'some biche de mer in the hands of one of the savages, who was greedily\\n', 'devouring it in its natural state. These anomalies--for they were such\\n', 'when considered in regard to the latitude--induced Captain Guy to wish\\n', 'for a thorough investigation of the country, in the hope of making a\\n', 'bent on prosecuting the voyage to the southward without delay. We had\\n', 'now fine weather, but there was no telling how long it would last; and\\n', 'being already in the eighty-fourth parallel, with an open sea before us,\\n', 'not listen with any patience to a proposition of stopping longer than\\n', 'was absolutely necessary for the health of the crew and the taking on\\n', 'captain that we might easily make this group on our return, and winter\\n', 'here in the event of being blocked up by the ice. He at length came into\\n', 'influence over him), and it was finally resolved that, even in the event\\n', 'of our finding biche de mer, we should only stay here a week to recruit,\\n', 'and then push on to the southward while we might. Accordingly we made\\n', 'every necessary preparation, and, under the guidance of Too-wit, got the\\n', 'Jane through the reef in safety, coming to anchor about a mile from the\\n', 'shore, in an excellent bay, completely landlocked, on the southeastern\\n', 'coast of the main island, and in ten fathoms of water, black sandy\\n', 'bottom. At the head of this bay there were three fine springs (we were\\n', 'told) of good water, and we saw abundance of wood in the vicinity. The\\n', 'four canoes followed us in, keeping, however, at a respectful distance.\\n', 'Too-wit himself remained on board, and, upon our dropping anchor,\\n', 'invited us to accompany him on shore, and visit his village in the\\n', 'interior. To this Captain Guy consented; and ten savages being left on\\n', 'board as hostages, a party of us, twelve in all, got in readiness to\\n', 'attend the chief. We took care to be well armed, yet without evincing\\n', 'any distrust. The schooner had her guns run out, her boarding-nettings\\n', 'up, and every other proper precaution was taken to guard against\\n', 'surprise. Directions were left with the chief mate to admit no person\\n', 'on board during our absence, and, in the event of our not appearing in\\n', 'twelve hours, to send the cutter, with a swivel, around the island in\\n', 'search of us.\\n', '\\n', 'At every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us that\\n', 'we were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto visited\\n', 'by civilized men. We saw nothing with which we had been formerly\\n', 'conversant. The trees resembled no growth of either the torrid, the\\n', 'temperate, or the northern frigid zones, and were altogether unlike\\n', 'those of the lower southern latitudes we had already traversed. The very\\n', 'rocks were novel in their mass, their color, and their stratification;\\n', 'and the streams themselves, utterly incredible as it may appear, had so\\n', 'little in common with those of other climates, that we were scrupulous\\n', 'of tasting them, and, indeed, had difficulty in bringing ourselves to\\n', 'believe that their qualities were purely those of nature. At a small\\n', 'brook which crossed our path (the first we had reached) Too-wit and his\\n', 'attendants halted to drink. On account of the singular character of the\\n', 'water, we refused to taste it, supposing it to be polluted; and it was\\n', 'not until some time afterward we came to understand that such was the\\n', 'to give a distinct idea of the nature of this liquid, and cannot do so\\n', 'without many words. Although it flowed with rapidity in all declivities\\n', 'where common water would do so, yet never, except when falling in\\n', 'a cascade, had it the customary appearance of limpidity. It was,\\n', 'nevertheless, in point of fact, as perfectly limpid as any limestone\\n', 'water in existence, the difference being only in appearance. At first\\n', 'sight, and especially in cases where little declivity was found, it bore\\n', 'resemblance, as regards consistency, to a thick infusion of gum\\n', 'arabic in common water. But this was only the least remarkable of its\\n', 'extraordinary qualities. It was not colourless, nor was it of any one\\n', 'uniform colour--presenting to the eye, as it flowed, every possible\\n', 'shade of purple; like the hues of a changeable silk. This variation in\\n', 'shade was produced in a manner which excited as profound astonishment\\n', 'in the minds of our party as the mirror had done in the case of Too-wit.\\n', 'Upon collecting a basinful, and allowing it to settle thoroughly, we\\n', 'perceived that the whole mass of liquid was made up of a number of\\n', 'distinct veins, each of a distinct hue; that these veins did not\\n', 'commingle; and that their cohesion was perfect in regard to their own\\n', 'particles among themselves, and imperfect in regard to neighbouring\\n', 'veins. Upon passing the blade of a knife athwart the veins, the water\\n', 'closed over it immediately, as with us, and also, in withdrawing it,\\n', 'all traces of the passage of the knife were instantly obliterated. If,\\n', 'however, the blade was passed down accurately between the two veins,\\n', 'a perfect separation was effected, which the power of cohesion did\\n', 'not immediately rectify. The phenomena of this water formed the first\\n', 'destined to be at length encircled.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'We were nearly three hours in reaching the village, it being more than\\n', 'nine miles in the interior, and the path lying through a rugged country.\\n', 'As we passed along, the party of Too-wit (the whole hundred and\\n', 'ten savages of the canoes) was momentarily strengthened by smaller\\n', 'detachments, of from two to six or seven, which joined us, as if by\\n', 'accident, at different turns of the road. There appeared so much of\\n', 'to Captain Guy of my apprehensions. It was now too late, however,\\n', 'to recede, and we concluded that our best security lay in evincing a\\n', 'perfect confidence in the good faith of Too-wit. We accordingly went\\n', 'on, keeping a wary eye upon the manoeuvres of the savages, and not\\n', 'permitting them to divide our numbers by pushing in between. In this\\n', 'way, passing through a precipitous ravine, we at length reached what we\\n', 'were told was the only collection of habitations upon the island. As we\\n', 'came in sight of them, the chief set up a shout, and frequently repeated\\n', 'the word Klock-klock, which we supposed to be the name of the village,\\n', 'or perhaps the generic name for villages.\\n', '\\n', 'The dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable, and,\\n', 'unlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with which mankind\\n', 'are acquainted, were of no uniform plan. Some of them (and these we\\n', 'found belonged to the Wampoos or Yampoos, the great men of the land)\\n', 'consisted of a tree cut down at about four feet from the root, with a\\n', 'large black skin thrown over it, and hanging in loose folds upon the\\n', 'ground. Under this the savage nestled. Others were formed by means\\n', 'of rough limbs of trees, with the withered foliage upon them, made to\\n', 'recline, at an angle of forty-five degrees, against a bank of clay,\\n', 'heaped up, without regular form, to the height of five or six feet.\\n', 'Others, again, were mere holes dug in the earth perpendicularly, and\\n', 'covered over with similar branches, these being removed when the tenant\\n', 'built among the forked limbs of trees as they stood, the upper limbs\\n', 'being partially cut through, so as to bend over upon the lower, thus\\n', 'forming thicker shelter from the weather. The greater number, however,\\n', 'consisted of small shallow caverns, apparently scratched in the face of\\n', 'a precipitous ledge of dark stone, resembling fuller’s earth, with which\\n', 'three sides of the village were bounded. At the door of each of these\\n', 'primitive caverns was a small rock, which the tenant carefully placed\\n', 'not ascertain, as the stone itself was never of sufficient size to close\\n', 'up more than a third of the opening.\\n', '\\n', 'This village, if it were worthy of the name, lay in a valley of some\\n', 'depth, and could only be approached from the southward, the precipitous\\n', 'directions. Through the middle of the valley ran a brawling stream of\\n', 'the same magical-looking water which has been described. We saw several\\n', 'strange animals about the dwellings, all appearing to be thoroughly\\n', 'domesticated. The largest of these creatures resembled our common hog in\\n', 'the structure of the body and snout; the tail, however, was bushy, and\\n', 'the legs slender as those of the antelope. Its motion was exceedingly\\n', 'awkward and indecisive, and we never saw it attempt to run. We noticed\\n', 'also several animals very similar in appearance, but of a greater length\\n', 'of body, and covered with a black wool. There were a great variety of\\n', 'tame fowls running about, and these seemed to constitute the chief food\\n', 'of the natives. To our astonishment we saw black albatross among these\\n', 'birds in a state of entire domestication, going to sea periodically\\n', 'for food, but always returning to the village as a home, and using the\\n', 'southern shore in the vicinity as a place of incubation. There they were\\n', 'joined by their friends the pelicans as usual, but these latter never\\n', 'followed them to the dwellings of the savages. Among the other kinds of\\n', 'tame fowls were ducks, differing very little from the canvass-back of\\n', 'our own country, black gannets, and a large bird not unlike the buzzard\\n', 'in appearance, but not carnivorous. Of fish there seemed to be a great\\n', 'abundance. We saw, during our visit, a quantity of dried salmon,\\n', 'rock cod, blue dolphins, mackerel, blackfish, skate, conger eels,\\n', 'elephantfish, mullets, soles, parrotfish, leather-jackets, gurnards,\\n', 'hake, flounders, paracutas, and innumerable other varieties. We noticed,\\n', 'too, that most of them were similar to the fish about the group of Lord\\n', 'Auckland Islands, in a latitude as low as fifty-one degrees south. The\\n', 'Gallipago tortoise was also very plentiful. We saw but few wild animals,\\n', 'and none of a large size, or of a species with which we were familiar.\\n', 'One or two serpents of a formidable aspect crossed our path, but the\\n', 'natives paid them little attention, and we concluded that they were not\\n', 'venomous.\\n', '\\n', 'As we approached the village with Too-wit and his party, a vast crowd of\\n', 'the people rushed out to meet us, with loud shouts, among which we could\\n', 'only distinguish the everlasting Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama! We were\\n', 'much surprised at perceiving that, with one or two exceptions, these new\\n', 'comers were entirely naked, and skins being used only by the men of\\n', 'the canoes. All the weapons of the country seemed also to be in the\\n', 'possession of the latter, for there was no appearance of any among the\\n', 'villagers. There were a great many women and children, the former not\\n', 'altogether wanting in what might be termed personal beauty. They were\\n', 'straight, tall, and well formed, with a grace and freedom of carriage\\n', 'not to be found in civilized society. Their lips, however, like those of\\n', 'the men, were thick and clumsy, so that, even when laughing, the teeth\\n', 'were never disclosed. Their hair was of a finer texture than that of the\\n', 'males. Among these naked villagers there might have been ten or twelve\\n', 'who were clothed, like the party of Too-wit, in dresses of black skin,\\n', 'and armed with lances and heavy clubs. These appeared to have great\\n', 'influence among the rest, and were always addressed by the title Wampoo.\\n', 'These, too, were the tenants of the black skin palaces. That of Too-wit\\n', 'was situated in the centre of the village, and was much larger and\\n', 'somewhat better constructed than others of its kind. The tree which\\n', 'formed its support was cut off at a distance of twelve feet or\\n', 'thereabouts from the root, and there were several branches left just\\n', 'below the cut, these serving to extend the covering, and in this way\\n', 'prevent its flapping about the trunk. The covering, too, which consisted\\n', 'of four very large skins fastened together with wooden skewers, was\\n', 'secured at the bottom with pegs driven through it and into the ground.\\n', 'The floor was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of carpet.\\n', '\\n', 'To this hut we were conducted with great solemnity, and as many of the\\n', 'natives crowded in after us as possible. Too-wit seated himself on the\\n', 'leaves, and made signs that we should follow his example. This we did,\\n', 'and presently found ourselves in a situation peculiarly uncomfortable,\\n', 'if not indeed critical. We were on the ground, twelve in number, with\\n', 'the savages, as many as forty, sitting on their hams so closely\\n', 'around us that, if any disturbance had arisen, we should have found it\\n', 'impossible to make use of our arms, or indeed to have risen to our feet.\\n', 'The pressure was not only inside the tent, but outside, where probably\\n', 'was every individual on the whole island, the crowd being prevented from\\n', 'trampling us to death only by the incessant exertions and vociferations\\n', 'of Too-wit. Our chief security lay, however, in the presence of Too-wit\\n', 'himself among us, and we resolved to stick by him closely, as the\\n', 'best chance of extricating ourselves from the dilemma, sacrificing him\\n', 'immediately upon the first appearance of hostile design.\\n', '\\n', 'After some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored, when\\n', 'the chief addressed us in a speech of great length, and very nearly\\n', 'resembling the one delivered in the canoes, with the exception that the\\n', 'Anamoo-moos! were now somewhat more strenuously insisted upon than the\\n', 'Lama-Lamas! We listened in profound silence until the conclusion of this\\n', 'harangue, when Captain Guy replied by assuring the chief of his eternal\\n', 'friendship and goodwill, concluding what he had to say by a present of\\n', 'several strings of blue beads and a knife. At the former the monarch,\\n', 'much to our surprise, turned up his nose with some expression of\\n', 'contempt, but the knife gave him the most unlimited satisfaction, and he\\n', 'immediately ordered dinner. This was handed into the tent over the\\n', 'heads of the attendants, and consisted of the palpitating entrails of a\\n', 'specialis of unknown animal, probably one of the slim-legged hogs which\\n', 'we had observed in our approach to the village. Seeing us at a loss how\\n', 'to proceed, he began, by way of setting us an example, to devour yard\\n', 'after yard of the enticing food, until we could positively stand it no\\n', 'longer, and evinced such manifest symptoms of rebellion of stomach as\\n', 'inspired his majesty with a degree of astonishment only inferior to that\\n', 'brought about by the looking-glasses. We declined, however, partaking of\\n', 'the delicacies before us, and endeavoured to make him understand that we\\n', 'had no appetite whatever, having just finished a hearty dejeuner.\\n', '\\n', 'When the monarch had made an end of his meal, we commenced a series of\\n', 'cross-questioning in every ingenious manner we could devise, with a\\n', 'view of discovering what were the chief productions of the country, and\\n', 'whether any of them might be turned to profit. At length he seemed to\\n', 'have some idea of our meaning, and offered to accompany us to a part of\\n', 'coast where he assured us the biche de mer (pointing to a specimen of\\n', 'that animal) was to be found in great abundance. We were glad of this\\n', 'early opportunity of escaping from the oppression of the crowd,\\n', 'and signified our eagerness to proceed. We now left the tent, and,\\n', 'accompanied by the whole population of the village, followed the chief\\n', 'to the southeastern extremity of the island, nor far from the bay where\\n', 'our vessel lay at anchor. We waited here for about an hour, until the\\n', 'four canoes were brought around by some of the savages to our station.\\n', 'The whole of our party then getting into one of them, we were paddled\\n', 'along the edge of the reef before mentioned, and of another still\\n', 'farther out, where we saw a far greater quantity of biche de mer than\\n', 'the oldest seamen among us had ever seen in those groups of the lower\\n', 'latitudes most celebrated for this article of commerce. We stayed near\\n', 'these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we could easily\\n', 'load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary, when we were taken\\n', 'alongside the schooner, and parted with Too-wit, after obtaining from\\n', 'him a promise that he would bring us, in the course of twenty-four\\n', 'hours, as many of the canvass-back ducks and Gallipago tortoises as his\\n', 'canoes would hold. In the whole of this adventure we saw nothing in the\\n', 'demeanour of the natives calculated to create suspicion, with the single\\n', 'exception of the systematic manner in which their party was strengthened\\n', 'during our route from the schooner to the village.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'with fresh provisions. We found the tortoises as fine as we had ever\\n', 'seen, and the ducks surpassed our best species of wild fowl, being\\n', 'exceedingly tender, juicy, and well-flavoured. Besides these, the\\n', 'savages brought us, upon our making them comprehend our wishes, a vast\\n', 'quantity of brown celery and scurvy grass, with a canoe-load of fresh\\n', 'fish and some dried. The celery was a treat indeed, and the scurvy grass\\n', 'proved of incalculable benefit in restoring those of our men who had\\n', 'shown symptoms of disease. In a very short time we had not a single\\n', 'person on the sick-list. We had also plenty of other kinds of fresh\\n', 'provisions, among which may be mentioned a species of shellfish\\n', 'resembling the mussel in shape, but with the taste of an oyster.\\n', 'Shrimps, too, and prawns were abundant, and albatross and other birds’\\n', 'eggs with dark shells. We took in, too, a plentiful stock of the flesh\\n', 'return for these good things we presented the natives with blue beads,\\n', 'brass trinkets, nails, knives, and pieces of red cloth, they being fully\\n', 'delighted in the exchange. We established a regular market on shore,\\n', 'just under the guns of the schooner, where our barterings were carried\\n', 'on with every appearance of good faith, and a degree of order which\\n', 'their conduct at the village of _Klock-klock_ had not led us to expect\\n', 'from the savages.\\n', '\\n', 'Matters went on thus very amicably for several days, during which\\n', 'parties of the natives were frequently on board the schooner, and\\n', 'parties of our men frequently on shore, making long excursions into the\\n', 'interior, and receiving no molestation whatever. Finding the ease with\\n', 'which the vessel might be loaded with _biche de mer_, owing to the\\n', 'friendly disposition of the islanders, and the readiness with which they\\n', 'would render us assistance in collecting it, Captain Guy resolved to\\n', 'enter into negotiations with Too-wit for the erection of suitable houses\\n', 'in which to cure the article, and for the services of himself and tribe\\n', 'in gathering as much as possible, while he himself took advantage of the\\n', 'fine weather to prosecute his voyage to the southward. Upon mentioning\\n', 'this project to the chief he seemed very willing to enter into an\\n', 'both parties, by which it was arranged that, after making the necessary\\n', 'preparations, such as laying off the proper grounds, erecting a portion\\n', 'of the buildings, and doing some other work in which the whole of\\n', 'our crew would be required, the schooner should proceed on her route,\\n', 'leaving three of her men on the island to superintend the fulfilment of\\n', 'the project, and instruct the natives in drying the _biche de mer_. In\\n', 'regard to terms, these were made to depend upon the exertions of the\\n', 'savages in our absence. They were to receive a stipulated quantity of\\n', 'blue beads, knives, red cloth, and so forth, for every certain number of\\n', 'piculs of the _biche de mer_ which should be ready on our return.\\n', '\\n', 'the method of preparing it, may prove of some interest to my readers,\\n', 'account of it. The following comprehensive notice of the substance is\\n', 'taken from a modern history of a voyage to the South Seas.\\n', '\\n', '“It is that _mollusca_ from the Indian Seas which is known to commerce\\n', 'am not much mistaken, the celebrated Cuvier calls it _gasteropeda\\n', 'pulmonifera_. It is abundantly gathered in the coasts of the Pacific\\n', 'islands, and gathered especially for the Chinese market, where it\\n', 'commands a great price, perhaps as much as their much-talked-of edible\\n', 'birds’ nests, which are properly made up of the gelatinous matter picked\\n', 'up by a species of swallow from the body of these molluscae. They have\\n', 'no shell, no legs, nor any prominent part, except an _absorbing_ and\\n', 'an _excretory_, opposite organs; but, by their elastic wings, like\\n', 'caterpillars or worms, they creep in shallow waters, in which, when low,\\n', 'they can be seen by a kind of swallow, the sharp bill of which, inserted\\n', 'in the soft animal, draws a gummy and filamentous substance, which, by\\n', 'drying, can be wrought into the solid walls of their nest. Hence the\\n', 'name of _gasteropeda pulmonifera_.\\n', '\\n', '“This mollusca is oblong, and of different sizes, from three to eighteen\\n', 'long. They were nearly round, a little flattish on one side, which lies\\n', 'next to the bottom of the sea; and they are from one to eight inches\\n', 'thick. They crawl up into shallow water at particular seasons of the\\n', 'year, probably for the purpose of gendering, as we often find them in\\n', 'pairs. It is when the sun has the most power on the water, rendering it\\n', 'tepid, that they approach the shore; and they often go up into places so\\n', 'shallow that, on the tide’s receding, they are left dry, exposed to\\n', 'the beat of the sun. But they do not bring forth their young in shallow\\n', 'water, as we never see any of their progeny, and full-grown ones are\\n', 'always observed coming in from deep water. They feed principally on that\\n', 'class of zoophytes which produce the coral.\\n', '\\n', '“The _biche de mer_ is generally taken in three or four feet of water;\\n', 'after which they are brought on shore, and split at one end with a\\n', 'knife, the incision being one inch or more, according to the size of the\\n', 'mollusca. Through this opening the entrails are forced out by pressure,\\n', 'and they are much like those of any other small tenant of the deep. The\\n', 'article is then washed, and afterward boiled to a certain degree, which\\n', 'must not be too much or too little. They are then buried in the ground\\n', 'for four hours, then boiled again for a short time, after which they are\\n', 'dried, either by the fire or the sun. Those cured by the sun are worth\\n', 'can cure thirty piculs by the fire. When once properly cured, they can\\n', 'be kept in a dry place for two or three years without any risk; but they\\n', 'should be examined once in every few months, say four times a year, to\\n', 'see if any dampness is likely to affect them.\\n', '\\n', '“The Chinese, as before stated, consider _biche de mer_ a very great\\n', 'luxury, believing that it wonderfully strengthens and nourishes the\\n', 'system, and renews the exhausted system of the immoderate voluptuary.\\n', 'The first quality commands a high price in Canton, being worth ninety\\n', 'dollars a picul; the second quality, seventy-five dollars; the third,\\n', 'fifty dollars; the fourth, thirty dollars; the fifth, twenty dollars;\\n', 'the sixth, twelve dollars; the seventh, eight dollars; and the eighth,\\n', 'four dollars; small cargoes, however, will often bring more in Manilla,\\n', 'Singapore, and Batavia.”\\n', '\\n', 'An agreement having been thus entered into, we proceeded immediately to\\n', 'land everything necessary for preparing the buildings and clearing\\n', 'selected, where there was plenty of both wood and water, and within a\\n', 'convenient distance of the principal reefs on which the _biche de mer_\\n', 'was to be procured. We now all set to work in good earnest, and soon, to\\n', 'the great astonishment of the savages, had felled a sufficient number of\\n', 'trees for our purpose, getting them quickly in order for the framework\\n', 'of the houses, which in two or three days were so far under way that\\n', 'we could safely trust the rest of the work to the three men whom we\\n', 'intended to leave behind. These were John Carson, Alfred Harris, and\\n', 'services in this respect.\\n', '\\n', 'By the last of the month we had everything in readiness for departure.\\n', 'We had agreed, however, to pay a formal visit of leave-taking to the\\n', 'village, and Too-wit insisted so pertinaciously upon our keeping the\\n', 'promise that we did not think it advisable to run the risk of offending\\n', 'the slightest suspicion of the good faith of the savages. They had\\n', 'uniformly behaved with the greatest decorum, aiding us with alacrity in\\n', 'our work, offering us their commodities, frequently without price, and\\n', 'never, in any instance, pilfering a single article, although the\\n', 'high value they set upon the goods we had with us was evident by the\\n', 'extravagant demonstrations of joy always manifested upon our making them\\n', 'a present. The women especially were most obliging in every respect,\\n', 'and, upon the whole, we should have been the most suspicious of human\\n', 'beings had we entertained a single thought of perfidy on the part of a\\n', 'this apparent kindness of disposition was only the result of a deeply\\n', 'laid plan for our destruction, and that the islanders for whom we\\n', 'entertained such inordinate feelings of esteem, were among the most\\n', 'barbarous, subtle, and bloodthirsty wretches that ever contaminated the\\n', 'face of the globe.\\n', '\\n', 'It was on the first of February that we went on shore for the purpose of\\n', 'visiting the village. Although, as said before, we entertained not the\\n', 'slightest suspicion, still no proper precaution was neglected. Six\\n', 'men were left in the schooner, with instructions to permit none of the\\n', 'savages to approach the vessel during our absence, under any pretence\\n', 'whatever, and to remain constantly on deck. The boarding-nettings were\\n', 'up, the guns double-shotted with grape and canister, and the swivels\\n', 'loaded with canisters of musket-balls. She lay, with her anchor apeak,\\n', 'about a mile from the shore, and no canoe could approach her in any\\n', 'direction without being distinctly seen and exposed to the full fire of\\n', 'our swivels immediately.\\n', '\\n', 'The six men being left on board, our shore-party consisted of thirty-two\\n', 'persons in all. We were armed to the teeth, having with us muskets,\\n', 'pistols, and cutlasses; besides, each had a long kind of seaman’s knife,\\n', 'somewhat resembling the bowie knife now so much used throughout our\\n', 'us at the landing for the purpose of accompanying us on our way. We\\n', 'noticed, however, with some surprise, that they were now entirely\\n', 'without arms; and, upon questioning Too-wit in relation to this\\n', 'circumstance, he merely answered that _Mattee non we pa pa si_--meaning\\n', 'that there was no need of arms where all were brothers. We took this in\\n', 'good part, and proceeded.\\n', '\\n', 'now entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain of soapstone\\n', 'hills among which the village was situated. This gorge was very\\n', 'rocky and uneven, so much so that it was with no little difficulty we\\n', 'scrambled through it on our first visit to Klock-klock. The whole length\\n', 'of the ravine might have been a mile and a half, or probably two\\n', 'miles. It wound in every possible direction through the hills (having\\n', 'apparently formed, at some remote period, the bed of a torrent), in no\\n', 'instance proceeding more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn. The\\n', 'feet in perpendicular altitude throughout the whole of their extent, and\\n', 'in some portions they arose to an astonishing height, overshadowing the\\n', 'pass so completely that but little of the light of day could penetrate.\\n', 'The general width was about forty feet, and occasionally it diminished\\n', 'so as not to allow the passage of more than five or six persons abreast.\\n', 'In short, there could be no place in the world better adapted for the\\n', 'consummation of an ambuscade, and it was no more than natural that we\\n', 'think of our egregious folly, the chief subject of astonishment seems\\n', 'to be, that we should have ever ventured, under any circumstances, so\\n', 'completely into the power of unknown savages as to permit them to march\\n', 'both before and behind us in our progress through this ravine. Yet such\\n', 'was the order we blindly took up, trusting foolishly to the force of\\n', 'our party, the unarmed condition of Too-wit and his men, the certain\\n', 'efficacy of our firearms (whose effect was yet a secret to the natives),\\n', 'and, more than all, to the long-sustained pretension of friendship kept\\n', 'up by these infamous wretches. Five or six of them went on before, as\\n', 'if to lead the way, ostentatiously busying themselves in removing the\\n', 'larger stones and rubbish from the path. Next came our own party. We\\n', 'walked closely together, taking care only to prevent separation. Behind\\n', 'followed the main body of the savages, observing unusual order and\\n', 'decorum.\\n', '\\n', 'Dirk Peters, a man named Wilson Allen, and myself were on the right of\\n', 'our companions, examining, as we went along, the singular stratification\\n', 'our attention. It was about wide enough for one person to enter without\\n', 'squeezing, and extended back into the hill some eighteen or twenty feet\\n', 'in a straight course, sloping afterward to the left. The height of the\\n', 'opening, is far as we could see into it from the main gorge, was perhaps\\n', 'sixty or seventy feet. There were one or two stunted shrubs growing from\\n', 'to examine, and pushed in briskly for that purpose, gathering five or\\n', 'as there was not room for two persons to pass, saying they should have\\n', 'some of my nuts. They accordingly turned, and were scrambling back,\\n', 'anything, that the whole foundations of the solid globe were suddenly\\n', 'rent asunder, and that the day of universal dissolution was at hand.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'suffocated, and grovelling in utter darkness among a quantity of loose\\n', 'earth, which was also falling upon me heavily in every direction,\\n', 'motionless for some moments, endeavouring to conceive what had happened\\n', 'and afterward the smothered voice of Peters calling to me for aid in the\\n', 'was buried in a loose mass of earth as far as his middle, and struggling\\n', 'in getting him out.\\n', '\\n', 'As soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise to be\\n', 'capable of conversing rationally, we both came to the conclusion\\n', 'that the walls of the fissure in which we had ventured had, by some\\n', 'convulsion of nature, or probably from their own weight, caved in\\n', 'overhead, and that we were consequently lost for ever, being thus\\n', 'entombed alive. For a long time we gave up supinely to the most intense\\n', 'agony and despair, such as cannot be adequately imagined by those\\n', 'incident ever occurring in the course of human events is more adapted to\\n', 'inspire the supremeness of mental and bodily distress than a case like\\n', 'our own, of living inhumation. The blackness of darkness which envelops\\n', 'the victim, the terrific oppression of lungs, the stifling fumes from\\n', 'the damp earth, unite with the ghastly considerations that we are beyond\\n', 'the remotest confines of hope, and that such is the allotted portion of\\n', 'the dead, to carry into the human heart a degree of appalling awe and\\n', 'horror not to be tolerated--never to be conceived.\\n', '\\n', 'At length Peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain\\n', 'precisely the extent of our calamity, and grope about our prison; it\\n', 'being barely possible, he observed, that some opening might yet be left\\n', 'exertion, attempted to force my way through the loose earth. Hardly had\\n', 'enough to convince me that, at all events, we should not immediately\\n', 'perish for want of air. We now took some degree of heart, and encouraged\\n', 'each other to hope for the best. Having scrambled over a bank of rubbish\\n', 'which impeded our farther progress in the direction of the light, we\\n', 'found less difficulty in advancing and also experienced some relief from\\n', 'the excessive oppression of lungs which had tormented us. Presently we\\n', 'were enabled to obtain a glimpse of the objects around, and discovered\\n', 'that we were near the extremity of the straight portion of the fissure,\\n', 'the bend, when to our inexpressible joy, there appeared a long seam or\\n', 'crack extending upward a vast distance, generally at an angle of about\\n', 'forty-five degrees, although sometimes much more precipitous. We could\\n', 'not see through the whole extent of this opening; but, as a good deal of\\n', 'light came down it, we had little doubt of finding at the top of it (if\\n', 'we could by any means reach the top) a clear passage into the open air.\\n', '\\n', 'the main gorge, and that our companion, Allen, was still missing; we\\n', 'determined at once to retrace our steps and look for him. After a long\\n', 'search, and much danger from the farther caving in of the earth above\\n', 'us, Peters at length cried out to me that he had hold of our companion’s\\n', 'foot, and that his whole body was deeply buried beneath the rubbish\\n', 'said was too true, and that, of course, life had been long extinct. With\\n', 'sorrowful hearts, therefore, we left the corpse to its fate, and again\\n', 'made our way to the bend.\\n', '\\n', 'The breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us, and, after\\n', 'one or two ineffectual efforts at getting up, we began once more to\\n', 'ran the main gorge was composed of a species of soft rock resembling\\n', 'soapstone. The sides of the cleft we were now attempting to ascend were\\n', 'of the same material, and so excessively slippery, being wet, that we\\n', 'could get but little foothold upon them even in their least precipitous\\n', 'parts; in some places, where the ascent was nearly perpendicular, the\\n', 'difficulty was, of course, much aggravated; and, indeed, for some time\\n', 'we thought insurmountable. We took courage, however, from despair, and\\n', 'what, by dint of cutting steps in the soft stone with our bowie knives,\\n', 'and swinging at the risk of our lives, to small projecting points of\\n', 'a harder species of slaty rock which now and then protruded from the\\n', 'general mass, we at length reached a natural platform, from which was\\n', 'perceptible a patch of blue sky, at the extremity of a thickly-wooded\\n', 'ravine. Looking back now, with somewhat more leisure, at the passage\\n', 'through which we had thus far proceeded, we clearly saw from the\\n', 'appearance of its sides, that it was of late formation, and we concluded\\n', 'that the concussion, whatever it was, which had so unexpectedly\\n', 'overwhelmed us, had also, at the same moment, laid open this path for\\n', 'escape. Being quite exhausted with exertion, and indeed, so weak that we\\n', 'were scarcely able to stand or articulate, Peters now proposed that we\\n', 'should endeavour to bring our companions to the rescue by firing the\\n', 'pistols which still remained in our girdles--the muskets as well as\\n', 'cutlasses had been lost among the loose earth at the bottom of the\\n', 'chasm. Subsequent events proved that, had we fired, we should have\\n', 'sorely repented it, but luckily a half suspicion of foul play had by\\n', 'this time arisen in my mind, and we forbore to let the savages know of\\n', 'our whereabouts.\\n', '\\n', 'After having reposed for about an hour, we pushed on slowly up the\\n', 'ravine, and had gone no great way before we heard a succession of\\n', 'tremendous yells. At length we reached what might be called the surface\\n', 'of the ground; for our path hitherto, since leaving the platform, had\\n', 'lain beneath an archway of high rock and foliage, at a vast distance\\n', 'overhead. With great caution we stole to a narrow opening, through which\\n', 'we had a clear sight of the surrounding country, when the whole dreadful\\n', 'secret of the concussion broke upon us in one moment and at one view.\\n', '\\n', 'The spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the highest\\n', 'peak in the range of the soapstone hills. The gorge in which our party\\n', 'of thirty-two had entered ran within fifty feet to the left of us. But,\\n', 'for at least one hundred yards, the channel or bed of this gorge was\\n', 'entirely filled up with the chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of\\n', 'earth and stone that had been artificially tumbled within it. The means\\n', 'by which the vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than\\n', 'evident, for sure traces of the murderous work were yet remaining. In\\n', 'several spots along the top of the eastern side of the gorge (we were\\n', 'now on the western) might be seen stakes of wood driven into the earth.\\n', 'In these spots the earth had not given way, but throughout the whole\\n', 'extent of the face of the precipice from which the mass had fallen,\\n', 'it was clear, from marks left in the soil resembling those made by the\\n', 'drill of the rock blaster, that stakes similar to those we saw standing\\n', 'had been inserted, at not more than a yard apart, for the length of\\n', 'perhaps three hundred feet, and ranging at about ten feet back from the\\n', 'edge of the gulf. Strong cords of grape vine were attached to the stakes\\n', 'still remaining on the hill, and it was evident that such cords had also\\n', 'singular stratification of these soapstone hills; and the description\\n', 'just given of the narrow and deep fissure through which we effected our\\n', 'escape from inhumation will afford a further conception of its nature.\\n', 'This was such that almost every natural convulsion would be sure to\\n', 'split the soil into perpendicular layers or ridges running parallel with\\n', 'one another, and a very moderate exertion of art would be sufficient\\n', 'for effecting the same purpose. Of this stratification the savages had\\n', 'availed themselves to accomplish their treacherous ends. There can be no\\n', 'doubt that, by the continuous line of stakes, a partial rupture of the\\n', 'soil had been brought about probably to the depth of one or two feet,\\n', 'when by means of a savage pulling at the end of each of the cords (these\\n', 'cords being attached to the tops of the stakes, and extending back from\\n', 'the edge of the cliff), a vast leverage power was obtained, capable of\\n', 'hurling the whole face of the hill, upon a given signal, into the bosom\\n', 'of the abyss below. The fate of our poor companions was no longer a\\n', 'matter of uncertainty. We alone had escaped from the tempest of that\\n', 'overwhelming destruction. We were the only living white men upon the\\n', 'island.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'when we had conceived ourselves entombed forever. We saw before us no\\n', 'prospect but that of being put to death by the savages, or of dragging\\n', 'out a miserable existence in captivity among them. We might, to be sure,\\n', 'conceal ourselves for a time from their observation among the fastnesses\\n', 'of the hills, and, as a final resort, in the chasm from which we had\\n', 'just issued; but we must either perish in the long polar winter through\\n', 'cold and famine, or be ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain\\n', 'relief.\\n', '\\n', 'The whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages, crowds\\n', 'of whom, we now perceived, had come over from the islands to the\\n', 'southward on flat rafts, doubtless with a view of lending their aid\\n', 'in the capture and plunder of the Jane. The vessel still lay calmly at\\n', 'anchor in the bay, those on board being apparently quite unconscious of\\n', 'any danger awaiting them. How we longed at that moment to be with them!\\n', 'either to aid in effecting their escape, or to perish with them in\\n', 'attempting a defence. We saw no chance even of warning them of their\\n', 'danger without bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads, with\\n', 'apprise them that something wrong had occurred; but the report could not\\n', 'possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety lay in getting\\n', 'out of the harbour forthwith--it could not tell them that no principles\\n', 'of honour now bound them to remain, that their companions were no longer\\n', 'among the living. Upon hearing the discharge they could not be more\\n', 'thoroughly prepared to meet the foe, who were now getting ready to\\n', 'attack, than they already were, and always had been. No good, therefore,\\n', 'and infinite harm, would result from our firing, and after mature\\n', 'deliberation, we forbore.\\n', '\\n', 'Our next thought was to attempt to rush toward the vessel, to seize one\\n', 'of the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay, and endeavour to\\n', 'force a passage on board. But the utter impossibility of succeeding in\\n', 'was literally swarming with the natives, skulking among the bushes and\\n', 'recesses of the hills, so as not to be observed from the schooner. In\\n', 'our immediate vicinity especially, and blockading the sole path by which\\n', 'we could hope to attain the shore at the proper point were stationed the\\n', 'whole party of the black skin warriors, with Too-wit at their head, and\\n', 'apparently only waiting for some re-enforcement to commence his onset\\n', 'upon the Jane. The canoes, too, which lay at the head of the bay, were\\n', 'manned with savages, unarmed, it is true, but who undoubtedly had arms\\n', 'within reach. We were forced, therefore, however unwillingly, to remain\\n', 'in our place of concealment, mere spectators of the conflict which\\n', 'presently ensued.\\n', '\\n', 'In about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts, or flatboats,\\n', 'without riggers, filled with savages, and coming round the southern\\n', 'bight of the harbor. They appeared to have no arms except short clubs,\\n', 'and stones which lay in the bottom of the rafts. Immediately afterward\\n', 'another detachment, still larger, appeared in an opposite direction, and\\n', 'with similar weapons. The four canoes, too, were now quickly filled with\\n', 'natives, starting up from the bushes at the head of the bay, and put off\\n', 'to tell it, and as if by magic, the Jane saw herself surrounded by an\\n', 'immense multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon capturing her at\\n', 'all hazards.\\n', '\\n', 'That they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an instant.\\n', 'The six men left in the vessel, however resolutely they might engage\\n', 'in her defence, were altogether unequal to the proper management of the\\n', 'hardly imagine that they would make resistance at all, but in this was\\n', 'the vessel’s starboard broadside to bear upon the canoes, which by this\\n', 'time were within pistol range, the rafts being nearly a quarter of a\\n', 'mile to windward. Owing to some cause unknown, but most probably to\\n', 'the agitation of our poor friends at seeing themselves in so hopeless a\\n', 'situation, the discharge was an entire failure. Not a canoe was hit or\\n', 'a single savage injured, the shots striking short and ricocheting over\\n', 'their heads. The only effect produced upon them was astonishment at\\n', 'the unexpected report and smoke, which was so excessive that for some\\n', 'return to the shore. And this they would most likely have done had our\\n', 'men followed up their broadside by a discharge of small arms, in which,\\n', 'as the canoes were now so near at hand, they could not have failed in\\n', 'doing some execution, sufficient, at least, to deter this party from a\\n', 'farther advance, until they could have given the rafts also a broadside.\\n', 'But, in place of this, they left the canoe party to recover from their\\n', 'panic, and, by looking about them, to see that no injury had been\\n', 'sustained, while they flew to the larboard to get ready for the rafts.\\n', '\\n', 'The discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect. The star\\n', 'and double-headed shot of the large guns cut seven or eight of the rafts\\n', 'completely asunder, and killed, perhaps, thirty or forty of the savages\\n', 'outright, while a hundred of them, at least, were thrown into the water,\\n', 'the most of them dreadfully wounded. The remainder, frightened out of\\n', 'their senses, commenced at once a precipitate retreat, not even waiting\\n', 'to pick up their maimed companions, who were swimming about in every\\n', 'direction, screaming and yelling for aid. This great success, however,\\n', 'came too late for the salvation of our devoted people. The canoe party\\n', 'were already on board the schooner to the number of more than a hundred\\n', 'and fifty, the most of them having succeeded in scrambling up the chains\\n', 'and over the boarding-netting even before the matches had been applied\\n', 'to the larboard guns. Nothing now could withstand their brute rage.\\n', 'Our men were borne down at once, overwhelmed, trodden under foot, and\\n', 'absolutely torn to pieces in an instant.\\n', '\\n', 'Seeing this, the savages on the rafts got the better of their fears,\\n', 'and came up in shoals to the plunder. In five minutes the Jane was a\\n', 'pitiable scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage. The decks were\\n', 'split open and ripped up; the cordage, sails, and everything movable on\\n', 'deck demolished as if by magic, while, by dint of pushing at the stern,\\n', 'towing with the canoes, and hauling at the sides, as they swam in\\n', 'thousands around the vessel, the wretches finally forced her on shore\\n', '(the cable having been slipped), and delivered her over to the good\\n', 'offices of Too-wit, who, during the whole of the engagement,\\n', 'had maintained, like a skilful general, his post of security and\\n', 'reconnaissance among the hills, but, now that the victory was completed\\n', 'to his satisfaction, condescended to scamper down with his warriors of\\n', 'the black skin, and become a partaker in the spoils.\\n', '\\n', 'Too-wit’s descent left us at liberty to quit our hiding place and\\n', 'reconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm. At about fifty yards\\n', 'from the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water, at which we slaked\\n', 'the burning thirst that now consumed us. Not far from the spring we\\n', 'tasting the nuts we found them palatable, and very nearly resembling\\n', 'in flavour the common English filbert. We collected our hats full\\n', 'immediately, deposited them within the ravine, and returned for more.\\n', 'While we were busily employed in gathering these, a rustling in the\\n', 'bushes alarmed us, and we were upon the point of stealing back to our\\n', 'covert, when a large black bird of the bittern species strugglingly and\\n', 'nothing, but Peters had sufficient presence of mind to run up to it\\n', 'before it could make its escape, and seize it by the neck. Its struggles\\n', 'and screams were tremendous, and we had thoughts of letting it go, lest\\n', 'the noise should alarm some of the savages who might be still lurking in\\n', 'it to the ground, and we dragged it into the ravine, congratulating\\n', 'ourselves that, at all events, we had thus obtained a supply of food\\n', 'enough to last us for a week.\\n', '\\n', 'We now went out again to look about us, and ventured a considerable\\n', 'distance down the southern declivity of the hill, but met with nothing\\n', 'else which could serve us for food. We therefore collected a quantity of\\n', 'dry wood and returned, seeing one or two large parties of the natives on\\n', 'their way to the village, laden with the plunder of the vessel, and who,\\n', 'we were apprehensive, might discover us in passing beneath the hill.\\n', '\\n', 'Our next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as\\n', 'possible, and with this object, we arranged some brushwood over the\\n', 'the patch of blue sky, on reaching the platform from the interior of the\\n', 'chasm. We left only a very small opening just wide enough to admit of\\n', 'our seeing the bay, without the risk of being discovered from below.\\n', 'Having done this, we congratulated ourselves upon the security of the\\n', 'position; for we were now completely excluded from observation, as long\\n', 'as we chose to remain within the ravine itself, and not venture out upon\\n', 'the hill, We could perceive no traces of the savages having ever been\\n', 'within this hollow; but, indeed, when we came to reflect upon the\\n', 'probability that the fissure through which we attained it had been only\\n', 'just now created by the fall of the cliff opposite, and that no other\\n', 'way of attaining it could be perceived, we were not so much rejoiced\\n', 'at the thought of being secure from molestation as fearful lest there\\n', 'should be absolutely no means left us for descent. We resolved to\\n', 'explore the summit of the hill thoroughly, when a good opportunity\\n', 'should offer. In the meantime we watched the motions of the savages\\n', 'through our loophole.\\n', '\\n', 'They had already made a complete wreck of the vessel, and were now\\n', 'preparing to set her on fire. In a little while we saw the smoke\\n', 'ascending in huge volumes from her main hatchway, and, shortly\\n', 'afterward, a dense mass of flame burst up from the forecastle. The\\n', 'rigging, masts and what remained of the sails caught immediately, and\\n', 'the fire spread rapidly along the decks. Still a great many of the\\n', 'savages retained their stations about her, hammering with large stones,\\n', 'axes, and cannon balls at the bolts and other iron and copper work. On\\n', 'the beach, and in canoes and rafts, there were not less, altogether,\\n', 'in the immediate vicinity of the schooner, than ten thousand natives,\\n', 'besides the shoals of them who, laden with booty, were making their\\n', 'way inland and over to the neighbouring islands. We now anticipated a\\n', 'catastrophe, and were not disappointed. First of all there came a smart\\n', 'shock (which we felt as distinctly where we were as if we had been\\n', 'slightly galvanized), but unattended with any visible signs of an\\n', 'explosion. The savages were evidently startled, and paused for an\\n', 'instant from their labours and yellings. They were upon the point of\\n', 'recommencing, when suddenly a mass of smoke puffed up from the decks,\\n', 'resembling a black and heavy thundercloud--then, as if from its bowels,\\n', 'arose a tall stream of vivid fire to the height, apparently, of a\\n', 'quarter of a mile--then there came a sudden circular expansion of the\\n', 'flame--then the whole atmosphere was magically crowded, in a single\\n', 'instant, with a wild chaos of wood, and metal, and human limbs--and,\\n', 'lastly, came the concussion in its fullest fury, which hurled us\\n', 'impetuously from our feet, while the hills echoed and re-echoed the\\n', 'tumult, and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the ruins\\n', 'tumbled headlong in every direction around us.\\n', '\\n', 'The havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation, and\\n', 'they had now, indeed, reaped the full and perfect fruits of their\\n', 'treachery. Perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion, while at least\\n', 'an equal number were desperately mangled. The whole surface of the bay\\n', 'was literally strewn with the struggling and drowning wretches, and\\n', 'on shore matters were even worse. They seemed utterly appalled by the\\n', 'suddenness and completeness of their discomfiture, and made no efforts\\n', 'at assisting one another. At length we observed a total change in their\\n', 'demeanour. From absolute stupor, they appeared to be, all at once,\\n', 'aroused to the highest pitch of excitement, and rushed wildly about,\\n', 'going to and from a certain point on the beach, with the strangest\\n', 'expressions of mingled horror, rage, and intense curiosity depicted\\n', 'on their countenances, and shouting, at the top of their voices,\\n', '“Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”\\n', '\\n', 'Presently we saw a large body go off into the hills, whence they\\n', 'returned in a short time, carrying stakes of wood. These they brought to\\n', 'the station where the crowd was the thickest, which now separated so as\\n', 'to afford us a view of the object of all this excitement. We perceived\\n', 'something white lying upon the ground, but could not immediately make\\n', 'out what it was. At length we saw that it was the carcass of the strange\\n', 'animal with the scarlet teeth and claws which the schooner had picked\\n', 'up at sea on the eighteenth of January. Captain Guy had had the body\\n', 'preserved for the purpose of stuffing the skin and taking it to England.\\n', 'the island, and it had been brought into the cabin and stowed away in\\n', 'one of the lockers. It had now been thrown on shore by the explosion;\\n', 'but why it had occasioned so much concern among the savages was more\\n', 'than we could comprehend. Although they crowded around the carcass at\\n', 'a little distance, none of them seemed willing to approach it closely.\\n', 'By-and-by the men with the stakes drove them in a circle around it, and\\n', 'no sooner was this arrangement completed, than the whole of the vast\\n', 'assemblage rushed into the interior of the island, with loud screams of\\n', '“Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'hiding-place upon the hill, going out only occasionally, and then with\\n', 'the greatest precaution, for water and filberts. We had made a kind of\\n', 'penthouse on the platform, furnishing it with a bed of dry leaves,\\n', 'and placing in it three large flat stones, which served us for both\\n', 'fireplace and table. We kindled a fire without difficulty by rubbing two\\n', 'pieces of dry wood together, the one soft, the other hard. The bird we\\n', 'had taken in such good season proved excellent eating, although somewhat\\n', 'tough. It was not an oceanic fowl, but a species of bittern, with jet\\n', 'black and grizzly plumage, and diminutive wings in proportion to its\\n', 'bulk. We afterward saw three of the same kind in the vicinity of the\\n', 'ravine, apparently seeking for the one we had captured; but, as they\\n', 'never alighted, we had no opportunity of catching them.\\n', '\\n', 'As long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our situation, but\\n', 'it was now entirely consumed, and it became absolutely necessary that\\n', 'we should look out for provision. The filberts would not satisfy the\\n', 'cravings of hunger, afflicting us, too, with severe gripings of the\\n', 'bowels, and, if freely indulged in, with violent headache. We had seen\\n', 'several large tortoises near the seashore to the eastward of the hill,\\n', 'and perceived they might be easily taken, if we could get at them\\n', 'without the observation of the natives. It was resolved, therefore, to\\n', 'make an attempt at descending.\\n', '\\n', 'We commenced by going down the southern declivity, which seemed to offer\\n', 'the fewest difficulties, but had not proceeded a hundred yards before\\n', '(as we had anticipated from appearances on the hilltop) our progress was\\n', 'entirely arrested by a branch of the gorge in which our companions had\\n', 'perished. We now passed along the edge of this for about a quarter of a\\n', 'mile, when we were again stopped by a precipice of immense depth, and,\\n', 'not being able to make our way along the brink of it, we were forced to\\n', 'retrace our steps by the main ravine.\\n', '\\n', 'We now pushed over to the eastward, but with precisely similar fortune.\\n', 'After an hour’s scramble, at the risk of breaking our necks, we\\n', 'discovered that we had merely descended into a vast pit of black\\n', 'granite, with fine dust at the bottom, and whence the only egress was by\\n', 'the rugged path in which we had come down. Toiling again up this path,\\n', 'we now tried the northern edge of the hill. Here we were obliged to\\n', 'use the greatest possible caution in our maneuvers, as the least\\n', 'indiscretion would expose us to the full view of the savages in the\\n', 'village. We crawled along, therefore, on our hands and knees, and,\\n', 'occasionally, were even forced to throw ourselves at full length,\\n', 'dragging our bodies along by means of the shrubbery. In this careful\\n', 'manner we had proceeded but a little way, when we arrived at a chasm\\n', 'far deeper than any we had yet seen, and leading directly into the main\\n', 'gorge. Thus our fears were fully confirmed, and we found ourselves cut\\n', 'off entirely from access to the world below. Thoroughly exhausted by\\n', 'our exertions, we made the best of our way back to the platform, and\\n', 'throwing ourselves upon the bed of leaves, slept sweetly and soundly for\\n', 'some hours.\\n', '\\n', 'For several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in\\n', 'exploring every part of the summit of the hill, in order to inform\\n', 'ourselves of its actual resources. We found that it would afford us no\\n', 'food, with the exception of the unwholesome filberts, and a rank species\\n', 'of scurvy grass, which grew in a little patch of not more than four rods\\n', 'square, and would be soon exhausted. On the fifteenth of February, as\\n', 'nuts were growing scarce; our situation, therefore, could hardly be more\\n', 'lamentable. {*5} On the sixteenth we again went round the walls of our\\n', 'prison, in hope of finding some avenue of escape; but to no purpose.\\n', 'We also descended the chasm in which we had been overwhelmed, with the\\n', 'faint expectation of discovering, through this channel, some opening to\\n', 'the main ravine. Here, too, we were disappointed, although we found and\\n', 'brought up with us a musket.\\n', '\\n', 'On the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining more\\n', 'thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made our way in\\n', 'the first search. We remembered that one of the fissures in the sides\\n', 'of this pit had been but partially looked into, and we were anxious\\n', 'to explore it, although with no expectation of discovering here any\\n', 'opening.\\n', '\\n', 'We found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow as\\n', 'before, and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some attention.\\n', 'It was, indeed, one of the most singular-looking places imaginable, and\\n', 'we could scarcely bring ourselves to believe it altogether the work of\\n', 'nature. The pit, from its eastern to its western extremity, was about\\n', 'five hundred yards in length, when all its windings were threaded; the\\n', 'suppose, having no means of accurate examination) than forty or fifty\\n', 'yards. Upon first descending into the chasm, that is to say, for a\\n', 'hundred feet downward from the summit of the hill, the sides of the\\n', 'abyss bore little resemblance to each other, and, apparently, had at\\n', 'no time been connected, the one surface being of the soapstone, and the\\n', 'other of marl, granulated with some metallic matter. The average breadth\\n', 'or interval between the two cliffs was probably here sixty feet, but\\n', 'there seemed to be no regularity of formation. Passing down, however,\\n', 'beyond the limit spoken of, the interval rapidly contracted, and the\\n', 'sides began to run parallel, although, for some distance farther,\\n', 'they were still dissimilar in their material and form of surface.\\n', 'Upon arriving within fifty feet of the bottom, a perfect regularity\\n', 'commenced. The sides were now entirely uniform in substance, in colour,\\n', 'and in lateral direction, the material being a very black and shining\\n', 'granite, and the distance between the two sides, at all points facing\\n', 'each other, exactly twenty yards. The precise formation of the chasm\\n', 'will be best understood by means of a delineation taken upon the spot;\\n', 'with great care through a long series of subsequent adventure, and to\\n', 'have been crowded from my remembrance.\\n', '\\n', 'This figure [No figures in text] gives the general outlines of the\\n', 'chasm, without the minor cavities in the sides, of which there were\\n', 'several, each cavity having a corresponding protuberance opposite. The\\n', 'bottom of the gulf was covered to the depth of three or four inches with\\n', 'a powder almost impalpable, beneath which we found a continuation of the\\n', 'black granite. To the right, at the lower extremity, will be noticed the\\n', 'appearance of a small opening; this is the fissure alluded to above, and\\n', 'to examine which more minutely than before was the object of our second\\n', 'visit. We now pushed into it with vigor, cutting away a quantity of\\n', 'brambles which impeded us, and removing a vast heap of sharp flints\\n', 'somewhat resembling arrowheads in shape. We were encouraged to\\n', 'persevere, however, by perceiving some little light proceeding from the\\n', 'farther end. We at length squeezed our way for about thirty feet, and\\n', 'found that the aperture was a low and regularly formed arch, having a\\n', 'light now broke upon us, and, turning a short bend, we found ourselves\\n', 'in another lofty chamber, similar to the one we had left in every\\n', 'respect but longitudinal form. Its general figure is here given.\\n', '\\n', 'The total length of this chasm, commencing at the opening _a_ and\\n', 'proceeding round the curve _b_ to the extremity _d_, is five hundred and\\n', 'fifty yards. At _c_ we discovered a small aperture similar to the one\\n', 'through which we had issued from the other chasm, and this was choked up\\n', 'in the same manner with brambles and a quantity of the white arrowhead\\n', 'flints. We forced our way through it, finding it about forty feet long,\\n', 'and emerged into a third chasm. This, too, was precisely like the\\n', 'first, except in its longitudinal shape, which was thus.\\n', '\\n', 'We found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and\\n', 'twenty yards. At the point _a_ was an opening about six feet wide, and\\n', 'extending fifteen feet into the rock, where it terminated in a bed of\\n', 'marl, there being no other chasm beyond, as we had expected. We were\\n', 'about leaving this fissure, into which very little light was admitted,\\n', 'when Peters called my attention to a range of singular-looking\\n', 'indentures in the surface of the marl forming the termination of the\\n', '_cul-de-sac_. With a very slight exertion of the imagination, the left,\\n', 'or most northern of these indentures might have been taken for the\\n', 'intentional, although rude, representation of a human figure standing\\n', 'erect, with outstretched arm. The rest of them bore also some little\\n', 'resemblance to alphabetical characters, and Peters was willing, at\\n', 'convinced him of his error, finally, by directing his attention to the\\n', 'floor of the fissure, where, among the powder, we picked up, piece by\\n', 'piece, several large flakes of the marl, which had evidently been broken\\n', 'off by some convulsion from the surface where the indentures were found,\\n', 'and which had projecting points exactly fitting the indentures; thus\\n', 'proving them to have been the work of nature.\\n', '\\n', 'After satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded us no\\n', 'means of escape from our prison, we made our way back, dejected and\\n', 'dispirited, to the summit of the hill. Nothing worth mentioning occurred\\n', 'during the next twenty-four hours, except that, in examining the ground\\n', 'to the eastward of the third chasm, we found two triangular holes of\\n', 'great depth, and also with black granite sides. Into these holes we\\n', 'did not think it worth while to attempt descending, as they had the\\n', 'appearance of mere natural wells, without outlet. They were each about\\n', 'twenty yards in circumference, and their shape, as well as relative\\n', 'position in regard to the third chasm, is shown in figure 5. {image}\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'subsist any longer upon the filberts, the use of which occasioned us the\\n', 'most excruciating torment, we resolved to make a desperate attempt at\\n', 'descending the southern declivity of the hill. The face of the\\n', 'precipice was here of the softest species of soapstone, although nearly\\n', 'perpendicular throughout its whole extent (a depth of a hundred and\\n', 'fifty feet at the least), and in many places even overarching. After\\n', 'a long search we discovered a narrow ledge about twenty feet below\\n', 'the brink of the gulf; upon this Peters contrived to leap, with what\\n', 'the possibility of descending the whole way by the process in which we\\n', 'had clambered up from the chasm when we had been buried by the fall of\\n', 'the hill--that is, by cutting steps in the face of the soapstone with\\n', 'our knives. The extreme hazard of the attempt can scarcely be conceived;\\n', 'but, as there was no other resource, we determined to undertake it.\\n', '\\n', 'Upon the ledge where we stood there grew some filbert-bushes; and to one\\n', 'of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs. The other end\\n', 'precipice until the handkerchiefs were stretched tight. He now proceeded\\n', 'to dig a deep hole in the soapstone (as far in as eight or ten inches),\\n', 'sloping away the rock above to the height of a foot, or thereabout,\\n', 'so as to allow of his driving, with the butt of a pistol, a tolerably\\n', 'feet, when he made a hole similar to the one below, driving in a peg as\\n', 'unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush, throwing him the end, which\\n', 'he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole, letting himself down gently\\n', 'to a station about three feet lower than he had yet been that is, to the\\n', 'full extent of the handkerchiefs. Here he dug another hole, and drove\\n', 'another peg. He then drew himself up, so as to rest his feet in the hole\\n', 'just cut, taking hold with his hands upon the peg in the one above. It\\n', 'was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost peg, with\\n', 'the view of fastening them to the second; and here he found that an\\n', 'error had been committed in cutting the holes at so great a distance\\n', 'apart. However, after one or two unsuccessful and dangerous attempts at\\n', 'reaching the knot (having to hold on with his left hand while he labored\\n', 'to undo the fastening with his right), he at length cut the string,\\n', 'leaving six inches of it affixed to the peg. Tying the handkerchiefs\\n', 'now to the second peg, he descended to a station below the third, taking\\n', 'have conceived of myself, and for which we were indebted altogether to\\n', 'Peters’ ingenuity and resolution) my companion finally succeeded, with\\n', 'the occasional aid of projections in the cliff, in reaching the bottom\\n', 'without accident.\\n', '\\n', 'before descending, and this, with my own, formed the rope necessary\\n', 'fastened this rope to the bushes, and let myself down rapidly, striving,\\n', 'overcome in no other manner. This answered sufficiently well for the\\n', 'terribly excited by thoughts of the vast depths yet to be descended, and\\n', 'the precarious nature of the pegs and soapstone holes which were my only\\n', 'keep my eyes steadily bent upon the flat surface of the cliff before me.\\n', 'became my conceptions, and the more horribly distinct. At length arrived\\n', 'that crisis of fancy, so fearful in all similar cases, the crisis in\\n', 'which we began to anticipate the feelings with which we _shall _fall--to\\n', 'picture to ourselves the sickness, and dizziness, and the last struggle,\\n', 'and the half swoon, and the final bitterness of the rushing and headlong\\n', 'violently together, while my fingers were gradually but certainly\\n', 'the cliff; and, with a wild, indefinable emotion, half of horror, half\\n', 'one moment my fingers clutched convulsively upon their hold, while, with\\n', 'the movement, the faintest possible idea of ultimate escape wandered,\\n', 'like a shadow, through my mind--in the next my whole soul was pervaded\\n', 'with a longing to fall; a desire, a yearning, a passion utterly\\n', 'half round from the precipice, remained tottering for an instant\\n', 'against its naked face. But now there came a spinning of the brain;\\n', 'a shrill-sounding and phantom voice screamed within my ears; a dusky,\\n', 'sunk down with a bursting heart, and plunged within its arms.\\n', '\\n', 'proceedings from his station at the bottom of the cliff; and perceiving\\n', 'my imminent danger, had endeavored to inspire me with courage by every\\n', 'suggestion he could devise; although my confusion of mind had been so\\n', 'great as to prevent my hearing what he said, or being conscious that he\\n', 'had even spoken to me at all. At length, seeing me totter, he hastened\\n', 'to ascend to my rescue, and arrived just in time for my preservation.\\n', 'it was, he contrived to let me down gently, so as to remain suspended\\n', 'without danger until animation returned. This was in about fifteen\\n', 'being, and, with some little further aid from my companion, reached the\\n', 'bottom also in safety.\\n', '\\n', 'We now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved the\\n', 'tomb of our friends, and to the southward of the spot where the hill had\\n', 'fallen. The place was one of singular wildness, and its aspect brought\\n', 'to my mind the descriptions given by travellers of those dreary regions\\n', 'marking the site of degraded Babylon. Not to speak of the ruins of the\\n', 'disrupted cliff, which formed a chaotic barrier in the vista to the\\n', 'northward, the surface of the ground in every other direction was strewn\\n', 'with huge tumuli, apparently the wreck of some gigantic structures of\\n', 'art; although, in detail, no semblance of art could be detected.\\n', 'Scoria were abundant, and large shapeless blocks of the black granite,\\n', 'intermingled with others of marl, {*6} and both granulated with metal.\\n', 'Of vegetation there were no traces whatsoever throughout the whole of\\n', 'the desolate area within sight. Several immense scorpions were seen,\\n', 'and various reptiles not elsewhere to be found in the high latitudes. As\\n', 'food was our most immediate object, we resolved to make our way to the\\n', 'seacoast, distant not more than half a mile, with a view of catching\\n', 'turtle, several of which we had observed from our place of concealment\\n', 'on the hill. We had proceeded some hundred yards, threading our route\\n', 'cautiously between the huge rocks and tumuli, when, upon turning a\\n', 'corner, five savages sprung upon us from a small cavern, felling Peters\\n', 'to the ground with a blow from a club. As he fell the whole party rushed\\n', 'upon him to secure their victim, leaving me time to recover from my\\n', 'as useless, preferring to trust my pistols, which had been carefully\\n', 'one after the other in quick succession. Two savages fell, and one,\\n', 'who was in the act of thrusting a spear into Peters, sprung to his feet\\n', 'without accomplishing his purpose. My companion being thus released,\\n', 'we had no further difficulty. He had his pistols also, but prudently\\n', 'declined using them, confiding in his great personal strength, which far\\n', 'of the savages who had fallen, he dashed out the brains of the three who\\n', 'remained, killing each instantaneously with a single blow of the weapon,\\n', 'and leaving us completely masters of the field.\\n', '\\n', 'So rapidly had these events passed, that we could scarcely believe\\n', 'in their reality, and were standing over the bodies of the dead in a\\n', 'species of stupid contemplation, when we were brought to recollection by\\n', 'the sound of shouts in the distance. It was clear that the savages had\\n', 'been alarmed by the firing, and that we had little chance of avoiding\\n', 'discovery. To regain the cliff, it would be necessary to proceed in the\\n', 'direction of the shouts, and even should we succeed in arriving at\\n', 'its base, we should never be able to ascend it without being seen. Our\\n', 'situation was one of the greatest peril, and we were hesitating in which\\n', 'path to commence a flight, when one of the savages _whom _I had shot,\\n', 'and supposed dead, sprang briskly to his feet, and attempted to make his\\n', 'escape. We overtook _him, _however, before he had advanced many paces,\\n', 'and were about to put him to death, when Peters suggested that we might\\n', 'derive some benefit from forcing him to accompany us in our attempt to\\n', 'escape. We therefore dragged him with us, making him understand that\\n', 'we would shoot him if he offered resistance. In a few minutes he was\\n', 'perfectly submissive, and ran by our sides as we pushed in among the\\n', 'rocks, making for the seashore.\\n', '\\n', 'So far, the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing hid\\n', 'the sea, except at intervals, from our sight, and, when we first had it\\n', 'fairly in view, it was perhaps two hundred yards distant. As we emerged\\n', 'into the open beach we saw, to our great dismay, an immense crowd of the\\n', 'natives pouring from the village, and from all visible quarters of\\n', 'the island, making toward us with gesticulations of extreme fury, and\\n', 'howling like wild beasts. We were upon the point of turning upon our\\n', 'steps, and trying to secure a retreat among the fastnesses of the\\n', 'behind a large rock which ran out into the water. Toward these we\\n', 'now ran with all speed, and, reaching them, found them unguarded, and\\n', 'without any other freight than three of the large Gallipago turtles\\n', 'and the usual supply of paddles for sixty rowers. We instantly took\\n', 'possession of one of them, and, forcing our captive on board, pushed out\\n', 'to sea with all the strength we could command.\\n', '\\n', 'We had not made, however, more than fifty yards from the shore before we\\n', 'became sufficiently calm to perceive the great oversight of which we had\\n', 'been guilty in leaving the other canoe in the power of the savages,\\n', 'who, by this time, were not more than twice as far from the beach as\\n', 'ourselves, and were rapidly advancing to the pursuit. No time was now to\\n', 'be lost. Our hope was, at best, a forlorn one, but we had none other. It\\n', 'was very doubtful whether, with the utmost exertion, we could get back\\n', 'in time to anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe; but\\n', 'yet there was a chance that we could. We might save ourselves if we\\n', 'succeeded, while not to make the attempt was to resign ourselves to\\n', 'inevitable butchery.\\n', '\\n', 'The canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike, and, in place of\\n', 'turning it around, we merely changed our position in paddling. As soon\\n', 'as the savages perceived this they redoubled their yells, as well as\\n', 'their speed, and approached with inconceivable rapidity. We pulled,\\n', 'however, with all the energy of desperation, and arrived at the\\n', 'contested point before more than one of the natives had attained it.\\n', 'This man paid dearly for his superior agility, Peters shooting him\\n', 'through the head with a pistol as he approached the shore. The foremost\\n', 'among the rest of his party were probably some twenty or thirty paces\\n', 'distant as we seized upon the canoe. We at first endeavored to pull her\\n', 'into the deep water, beyond the reach of the savages, but, finding her\\n', 'too firmly aground, and there being no time to spare, Peters, with one\\n', 'or two heavy strokes from the butt of the musket, succeeded in dashing\\n', 'out a large portion of the bow and of one side. We then pushed off.\\n', 'Two of the natives by this time had got hold of our boat, obstinately\\n', 'refusing to let go, until we were forced to despatch them with our\\n', 'knives. We were now clear off, and making great way out to sea. The main\\n', 'body of the savages, upon reaching the broken canoe, set up the most\\n', 'tremendous yell of rage and disappointment conceivable. In truth, from\\n', 'wicked, hypocritical, vindictive, bloodthirsty, and altogether fiendish\\n', 'race of men upon the face of the globe. It is clear we should have had\\n', 'no mercy had we fallen into their hands. They made a mad attempt at\\n', 'following us in the fractured canoe, but, finding it useless, again\\n', 'vented their rage in a series of hideous vociferations, and rushed up\\n', 'into the hills.\\n', '\\n', 'We were thus relieved from immediate danger, but our situation was still\\n', 'sufficiently gloomy. We knew that four canoes of the kind we had were\\n', 'at one time in the possession of the savages, and were not aware of the\\n', 'fact (afterward ascertained from our captive) that two of these had\\n', 'been blown to pieces in the explosion of the _Jane Guy. _We calculated,\\n', 'therefore, upon being yet pursued, as soon as our enemies could get\\n', 'round to the bay (distant about three miles) where the boats were\\n', 'usually laid up. Fearing this, we made every exertion to leave the\\n', 'island behind us, and went rapidly through the water, forcing the\\n', 'prisoner to take a paddle. In about half an hour, when we had gained\\n', 'probably five or six miles to the southward, a large fleet of the\\n', 'flat-bottomed canoes or rafts were seen to emerge from the bay evidently\\n', 'with the design of pursuit. Presently they put back, despairing to\\n', 'overtake us.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'latitude exceeding eighty-four degrees, in a frail canoe, and with no\\n', 'provision but the three turtles. The long polar winter, too, could not\\n', 'be considered as far distant, and it became necessary that we should\\n', 'deliberate well upon the course to be pursued. There were six or seven\\n', 'islands in sight belonging to the same group, and distant from each\\n', 'other about five or six leagues; but upon neither of these had we any\\n', 'intention to venture. In coming from the northward in the _Jane Guy_ we\\n', 'had been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of ice--this,\\n', 'however little it maybe in accordance with the generally received\\n', 'notions respecting the Antarctic, was a fact--experience would not\\n', 'permit us to deny. To attempt, therefore, getting back would be\\n', 'folly--especially at so late a period of the season. Only one course\\n', 'seemed to be left open for hope. We resolved to steer boldly to the\\n', 'southward, where there was at least a probability of discovering other\\n', 'lands, and more than a probability of finding a still milder climate.\\n', '\\n', 'So far we had found the Antarctic, like the Arctic Ocean, peculiarly\\n', 'free from violent storms or immoderately rough water; but our canoe was,\\n', 'at best, of frail structure, although large, and we set busily to\\n', 'work with a view of rendering her as safe as the limited means in our\\n', 'possession would admit. The body of the boat was of no better material\\n', 'than bark--the bark of a tree unknown. The ribs were of a tough osier,\\n', 'well adapted to the purpose for which it was used. We had fifty feet\\n', 'room from stem to stern, from four to six in breadth, and in depth\\n', 'throughout four feet and a half-the boats thus differing vastly in shape\\n', 'from those of any other inhabitants of the Southern Ocean with whom\\n', 'civilized nations are acquainted. We never did believe them the\\n', 'workmanship of the ignorant islanders who owned them; and some days\\n', 'after this period discovered, by questioning our captive, that they were\\n', 'in fact made by the natives of a group to the southwest of the country\\n', 'where we found them, having fallen accidentally into the hands of our\\n', 'barbarians. What we could do for the security of our boat was very\\n', 'little indeed. Several wide rents were discovered near both ends, and\\n', 'these we contrived to patch up with pieces of woollen jacket. With the\\n', 'help of the superfluous paddles, of which there were a great many, we\\n', 'erected a kind of framework about the bow, so as to break the force of\\n', 'any seas which might threaten to fill us in that quarter. We also set\\n', 'up two paddle-blades for masts, placing them opposite each other, one\\n', 'by each gunwale, thus saving the necessity of a yard. To these masts we\\n', 'attached a sail made of our shirts-doing this with some difficulty, as\\n', 'here we could get no assistance from our prisoner whatever, although he\\n', 'had been willing enough to labor in all the other operations. The sight\\n', 'of the linen seemed to affect him in a very singular manner. He could\\n', 'not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we\\n', 'attempted to force him, and shrieking out, _“Tekeli-li!”_\\n', '\\n', 'Having completed our arrangements in regard to the security of the\\n', 'canoe, we now set sail to the south-southeast for the present, with the\\n', 'view of weathering the most southerly of the group in sight. This being\\n', 'done, we turned the bow full to the southward. The weather could by no\\n', 'means be considered disagreeable. We had a prevailing and very gentle\\n', 'wind from the northward, a smooth sea, and continual daylight. No ice\\n', 'leaving the parallel of Bennet’s Islet. _Indeed, the temperature of the\\n', 'water was here far too warm for its existence in any quantity. Having\\n', 'killed the largest of our tortoises, and obtained from him not only food\\n', 'but a copious supply of water, we continued on our course, without any\\n', 'incident of moment, for perhaps seven or eight days, during which period\\n', 'we must have proceeded a vast distance to the southward, as the wind\\n', 'blew constantly with us, and a very strong current set continually in\\n', 'the direction we were pursuing.\\n', '\\n', '_March 1st_. {*7}-Many unusual phenomena now--indicated that we were\\n', 'gray vapor appeared constantly in the southern horizon, flaring up\\n', 'occasionally in lofty streaks, now darting from east to west, now from\\n', 'west to east, and again presenting a level and uniform summit--in short,\\n', 'having all the wild variations of the Aurora Borealis. The average\\n', 'height of this vapor, as apparent from our station, was about\\n', 'twenty-five degrees. The temperature of the sea seemed to be increasing\\n', 'momentarily, and there was a very perceptible alteration in its color.\\n', '\\n', 'to the knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island of the\\n', 'islands in the group--that they were governed by a common king, named\\n', '_Tsalemon _or _Psalemoun, _who resided in one of the smallest of the\\n', 'islands; that the black skins forming the dress of the warriors came\\n', 'from an animal of huge size to be found only in a valley near the court\\n', 'of the king--that the inhabitants of the group fabricated no other boats\\n', 'than the flat-bottomed rafts; the four canoes being all of the kind in\\n', 'their possession, and, these having been obtained, by mere accident,\\n', 'from some large island in the southwest--that his own name was Nu-Nu--that\\n', 'he had no knowledge of Bennet’s Islet--and that the appellation of the\\n', 'island he had left was Tsalal. The commencement of the words _Tsalemon\\n', '_and Tsalal was given with a prolonged hissing sound, which we found\\n', 'it impossible to imitate, even after repeated endeavors, and which was\\n', 'precisely the same with the note of the black bittern we had eaten up on\\n', 'the summit of the hill.\\n', '\\n', 'was undergoing a rapid change, being no longer transparent, but of a\\n', 'milky consistency and hue. In our immediate vicinity it was usually\\n', 'smooth, never so rough as to endanger the canoe--but we were frequently\\n', 'surprised at perceiving, to our right and left, at different distances,\\n', 'sudden and extensive agitations of the surface; these, we at length\\n', 'noticed, were always preceded by wild flickerings in the region of vapor\\n', 'to the southward.\\n', '\\n', 'handkerchief. Nu-Nu was seated at my elbow, and the linen accidentally\\n', 'flaring in his face, he became violently affected with convulsions.\\n', 'These were succeeded by drowsiness and stupor, and low murmurings of\\n', '_“‘Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”_\\n', '\\n', '_March _5th.-The wind had entirely ceased, but it was evident that\\n', 'we were still hurrying on to the southward, under the influence of a\\n', 'powerful current. And now,--indeed, it would seem reasonable that we\\n', 'should experience some alarm at the turn events were taking--but we\\n', 'felt none. The countenance of Peters indicated nothing of this nature,\\n', 'a numbness of body and mind--a dreaminess of sensation but this was all.\\n', '\\n', 'horizon, and was gradually losing its grayness of tint. The heat of the\\n', 'water was extreme, even unpleasant to the touch, and its milky hue was\\n', 'more evident than ever. Today a violent agitation of the water occurred\\n', 'very close to the canoe. It was attended, as usual, with a wild flaring\\n', 'fine white powder, resembling ashes--but certainly not such--fell over the\\n', 'canoe and over a large surface of the water, as the flickering died away\\n', 'among the vapor and the commotion subsided in the sea. Nu-Nu now threw\\n', 'himself on his face in the bottom of the boat, and no persuasions could\\n', 'induce him to arise.\\n', '\\n', 'his countrymen in destroying our companions; but he appeared to be too\\n', 'utterly overcome by terror to afford us any rational reply. He still\\n', 'obstinately lay in the bottom of the boat; and, upon reiterating the\\n', 'questions as to the motive, made use only of idiotic gesticulations,\\n', 'such as raising with his forefinger the upper lip, and displaying the\\n', 'teeth which lay beneath it. These were black. We had never before seen\\n', 'the teeth of an inhabitant of Tsalal.\\n', '\\n', 'appearance upon the beach at Tsalal had occasioned so wild a commotion\\n', 'increased, and the hand could no longer be endured within it. Peters\\n', 'breathed, and no more.\\n', '\\n', 'and in vast quantities. The range of vapor to the southward had arisen\\n', 'prodigiously in the horizon, and began to assume more distinctness\\n', 'silently into the sea from some immense and far-distant rampart in\\n', 'the heaven. The gigantic curtain ranged along the whole extent of the\\n', 'southern horizon. It emitted no sound.\\n', '\\n', 'milky depths of the ocean a luminous glare arose, and stole up along\\n', 'the bulwarks of the boat. We were nearly overwhelmed by the white ashy\\n', 'shower which settled upon us and upon the canoe, but melted into the\\n', 'water as it fell. The summit of the cataract was utterly lost in the\\n', 'dimness and the distance. Yet we were evidently approaching it with a\\n', 'hideous velocity. At intervals there were visible in it wide, yawning,\\n', 'but momentary rents, and from out these rents, within which was a chaos\\n', 'of flitting and indistinct images, there came rushing and mighty, but\\n', 'soundless winds, tearing up the enkindled ocean in their course.\\n', '\\n', 'glare of the water thrown back from the white curtain before us. Many\\n', 'gigantic and pallidly white birds flew continuously now from beyond the\\n', 'veil, and their scream was the eternal _Tekeli-li! _as they retreated\\n', 'from our vision. Hereupon Nu-Nu stirred in the bottom of the boat; but\\n', 'upon touching him we found his spirit departed. And now we rushed into\\n', 'the embraces of the cataract, where a chasm threw itself open to receive\\n', 'us. But there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure, very far\\n', 'larger in its proportions than any dweller among men. And the hue of the\\n', 'skin of the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the snow.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'of Mr. Pym are already well known to the public through the medium of\\n', 'the daily press. It is feared that the few remaining chapters which were\\n', 'to have completed his narrative, and which were retained by him,\\n', 'while the above were in type, for the purpose of revision, have been\\n', 'irrecoverably lost through the accident by which he perished himself.\\n', 'This, however, may prove not to be the case, and the papers, if\\n', 'ultimately found, will be given to the public.\\n', '\\n', 'No means have been left untried to remedy the deficiency. The gentleman\\n', 'whose name is mentioned in the preface, and who, from the statement\\n', 'there made, might be supposed able to fill the vacuum, has declined\\n', 'the task--this, for satisfactory reasons connected with the general\\n', 'inaccuracy of the details afforded him, and his disbelief in the entire\\n', 'truth of the latter portions of the narration. Peters, from whom\\n', 'some information might be expected, is still alive, and a resident of\\n', 'Illinois, but cannot be met with at present. He may hereafter be found,\\n', 'and will, no doubt, afford material for a conclusion of Mr. Pym’s\\n', 'account.\\n', '\\n', 'The loss of two or three final chapters (for there were but two or\\n', 'three) is the more deeply to be regretted, as it can not be doubted they\\n', 'contained matter relative to the Pole itself, or at least to regions in\\n', 'its very near proximity; and as, too, the statements of the author in\\n', 'relation to these regions may shortly be verified or contradicted by\\n', 'means of the governmental expedition now preparing for the Southern\\n', 'Ocean.\\n', '\\n', 'On one point in the narrative some remarks may well be offered; and it\\n', 'would afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if what he may\\n', 'here observe should have a tendency to throw credit, in any degree, upon\\n', 'the very singular pages now published. We allude to the chasms found in\\n', 'the island of Tsalal, and to the whole of the figures upon pages 245-47\\n', '{of the printed edition--ed.}.\\n', '\\n', '(Note: No figures were included with this text)\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Pym has given the figures of the chasms without comment, and\\n', 'speaks decidedly of the _indentures _found at the extremity of the\\n', 'most easterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful resemblance to\\n', 'alphabetical characters, and, in short, as being positively _not such.\\n', '_This assertion is made in a manner so simple, and sustained by a\\n', 'species of demonstration so conclusive (viz., the fitting of the\\n', 'projections of the fragments found among the dust into the indentures\\n', 'upon the wall), that we are forced to believe the writer in earnest;\\n', 'and no reasonable reader should suppose otherwise. But as the facts in\\n', 'relation to all the figures are most singular (especially when taken in\\n', 'connection with statements made in the body of the narrative), it may\\n', 'be as well to say a word or two concerning them all--this, too, the more\\n', 'especially as the facts in question have, beyond doubt, escaped the\\n', 'attention of Mr. Poe.\\n', '\\n', 'one another in the precise order which the chasms themselves presented,\\n', 'and when deprived of the small lateral branches or arches (which, it\\n', 'will be remembered, served only as a means of communication between the\\n', 'main chambers, and were of totally distinct character), constitute an\\n', 'Ethiopian verbal root--the root “To be shady,’--whence all the\\n', 'inflections of shadow or darkness.\\n', '\\n', 'In regard to the “left or most northwardly” of the indentures in figure\\n', '4, it is more than probable that the opinion of Peters was correct,\\n', 'and that the hieroglyphical appearance was really the work of art,\\n', 'and intended as the representation of a human form. The delineation\\n', 'is before the reader, and he may, or may not, perceive the resemblance\\n', 'suggested; but the rest of the indentures afford strong confirmation\\n', 'of Peters’ idea. The upper range is evidently the Arabic verbal root\\n', '“To be white,” whence all the inflections of brilliancy and\\n', 'whiteness. The lower range is not so immediately perspicuous. The\\n', 'characters are somewhat broken and disjointed; nevertheless, it can not\\n', 'be doubted that, in their perfect state, they formed the full Egyptian\\n', 'word, “The region of the south.” It should be observed that\\n', 'these interpretations confirm the opinion of Peters in regard to the\\n', '“most northwardly” of the figures. The arm is outstretched toward the\\n', 'south.\\n', '\\n', 'Conclusions such as these open a wide field for speculation and exciting\\n', 'conjecture. They should be regarded, perhaps, in connection with some\\n', 'of the most faintly detailed incidents of the narrative; although in no\\n', 'visible manner is this chain of connection complete. Tekeli-li! was the\\n', 'cry of the affrighted natives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcase\\n', 'of the _white _animal picked up at sea. This also was the shuddering\\n', 'exclamatives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcass of the _white\\n', '_materials in possession of Mr. Pym. This also was the shriek of the\\n', 'swift-flying, _white, _and gigantic birds which issued from the vapory\\n', '_white _curtain of the South. Nothing _white _was to be found at Tsalal,\\n', 'and nothing otherwise in the subsequent voyage to the region beyond. It\\n', 'is not impossible that “Tsalal,” the appellation of the island of the\\n', 'chasms, may be found, upon minute philological scrutiny, to betray\\n', 'either some alliance with the chasms themselves, or some reference to\\n', 'the Ethiopian characters so mysteriously written in their windings.\\n', '\\n', 'within the rock.”_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Notes\\n', '\\n', '{*1} Whaling vessels are usually fitted with iron oil-tanks--why the\\n', '\\n', '{*2} The case of the brig _Polly_, of Boston, is one so much in point,\\n', 'and her fate, in many respects, so remarkably similar to our own, that\\n', 'thirty tons burden, sailed from Boston, with a cargo of lumber and\\n', 'provisions, for Santa Croix, on the twelfth of December, 1811, under the\\n', 'command of Captain Casneau.

It was\\n', 'the radiance of an opium-dream--an airy and spirit-lifting vision\\n', 'more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered vision about the\\n', 'slumbering souls of the daughters of Delos. Yet her features were not of\\n', 'that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the\\n', 'classical labors of the heathen. “There is no exquisite beauty,” says\\n', 'Bacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of all the forms and genera of\\n', 'that the features of Ligeia were not of a classic regularity--although\\n', 'to detect the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of “the\\n', 'was faultless--how cold indeed that word when applied to a majesty so\\n', 'divine!--the skin rivalling the purest ivory, the commanding extent and\\n', 'repose, the gentle prominence of the regions above the temples; and\\n', 'then the raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant and naturally-curling\\n', 'tresses, setting forth the full force of the Homeric epithet,\\n', 'similar perfection. There were the same luxurious smoothness of surface,\\n', 'the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline, the same\\n', 'sweet mouth. Here was indeed the triumph of all things heavenly--the\\n', 'magnificent turn of the short upper lip--the soft, voluptuous slumber\\n', 'of the under--the dimples which sported, and the color which spoke--the\\n', 'teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy almost startling, every ray of\\n', 'the holy light which fell upon them in her serene and placid, yet most\\n', 'and the majesty, the fullness and the spirituality, of the Greek--the\\n', 'contour which the god Apollo revealed but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the\\n', '\\n', 'For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. It might have been,\\n', 'too, that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which Lord\\n', 'eyes of our own race. They were even fuller than the fullest of the\\n', 'gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of Nourjahad. Yet it was only\\n', 'at intervals--in moments of intense excitement--that this peculiarity\\n', 'became more than slightly noticeable in Ligeia. And at such moments was\\n', 'her beauty--in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps--the beauty of\\n', 'beings either above or apart from the earth--the beauty of the fabulous\\n', 'Houri of the Turk. The hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black,\\n', 'and, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. The brows,\\n', 'slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. The “strangeness,”\\n', 'formation, or the color, or the brilliancy of the features, and must,\\n', 'after all, be referred to the expression. Ah, word of no meaning! behind\\n', 'whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much\\n', 'of the spiritual. The expression of the eyes of Ligeia! How for long\\n', 'midsummer night, struggled to fathom it! What was it--that something\\n', 'more profound than the well of Democritus--which lay far within the\\n', 'discover. Those eyes! those large, those shining, those divine orbs!\\n', 'astrologers.\\n', '\\n', 'There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the\\n', 'believe, noticed in the schools--that, in our endeavors to recall to\\n', 'memory something long forgotten, we often find ourselves upon the very\\n', 'verge of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. And\\n', 'thus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny of Ligeia’s eyes, have\\n', 'approaching--yet not quite be mine--and so at length entirely depart!\\n', 'mean to say that, subsequently to the period when Ligeia’s beauty passed\\n', 'aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs. Yet not the more\\n', 'rapidly-growing vine--in the contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a\\n', 'people. And there are one or two stars in heaven--(one especially, a\\n', 'star of the sixth magnitude, double and changeable, to be found near the\\n', 'stringed instruments, and not unfrequently by passages from books. Among\\n', 'Joseph Glanvill, which (perhaps merely from its quaintness--who shall\\n', 'say?) never failed to inspire me with the sentiment;--“And the will\\n', 'therein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries of the will,\\n', 'with its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all things by\\n', 'nature of its intentness. Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto\\n', 'death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.”\\n', '\\n', 'Length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled me to trace,\\n', 'indeed, some remote connection between this passage in the English\\n', 'moralist and a portion of the character of Ligeia. An intensity in\\n', 'thought, action, or speech, was possibly, in her, a result, or at least\\n', 'an index, of that gigantic volition which, during our long intercourse,\\n', 'failed to give other and more immediate evidence of its existence.\\n', 'ever-placid Ligeia, was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous\\n', 'save by the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so\\n', 'delighted and appalled me--by the almost magical melody, modulation,\\n', 'distinctness and placidity of her very low voice--and by the fierce\\n', 'energy (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of\\n', 'utterance) of the wild words which she habitually uttered.\\n', '\\n', 'have never known in woman. In the classical tongues was she deeply\\n', 'proficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the\\n', 'any theme of the most admired, because simply the most abstruse of the\\n', 'singularly--how thrillingly, this one point in the nature of my wife has\\n', 'the man who has traversed, and successfully, all the wide areas of\\n', 'clearly perceive, that the acquisitions of Ligeia were gigantic, were\\n', 'resign myself, with a child-like confidence, to her guidance through the\\n', 'occupied during the earlier years of our marriage. With how vast a\\n', 'triumph--with how vivid a delight--with how much of all that is\\n', 'sought--but less known--that delicious vista by slow degrees expanding\\n', 'length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to\\n', 'be forbidden!\\n', '\\n', 'How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after some\\n', 'Her presence, her readings alone, rendered vividly luminous the many\\n', 'mysteries of the transcendentalism in which we were immersed. Wanting\\n', 'the radiant lustre of her eyes, letters, lambent and golden, grew duller\\n', 'than Saturnian lead. And now those eyes shone less and less frequently\\n', 'with a too--too glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of the\\n', 'transparent waxen hue of the grave, and the blue veins upon the lofty\\n', 'forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the gentle\\n', 'with the grim Azrael. And the struggles of the passionate wife were, to\\n', 'my astonishment, even more energetic than my own. There had been much in\\n', 'her stern nature to impress me with the belief that, to her, death would\\n', 'have come without its terrors;--but not so. Words are impotent to convey\\n', 'any just idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled\\n', 'desire for life,--for life--but for life--solace and reason were\\n', 'the uttermost folly. Yet not until the last instance, amid the most\\n', 'convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was shaken the external\\n', 'placidity of her demeanor. Her voice grew more gentle--grew more\\n', 'more than mortal--to assumptions and aspirations which mortality had\\n', 'never before known.\\n', '\\n', 'easily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have reigned\\n', 'strength of her affection. For long hours, detaining my hand, would she\\n', 'pour out before me the overflowing of a heart whose more than passionate\\n', 'of my beloved in the hour of her making them? But upon this subject\\n', 'womanly abandonment to a love, alas! all unmerited, all unworthily\\n', 'wildly earnest a desire for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly\\n', 'away. It is this wild longing--it is this eager vehemence of desire\\n', 'capable of expressing.\\n', '\\n', 'At high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me,\\n', 'peremptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat certain verses composed by\\n', '\\n', '     Lo! ‘tis a gala night\\n', '       Within the lonesome latter years!\\n', '     An angel throng, bewinged, bedight\\n', '       In veils, and drowned in tears,\\n', '     Sit in a theatre, to see\\n', '     While the orchestra breathes fitfully\\n', '       The music of the spheres.\\n', '\\n', '     Mimes, in the form of God on high,\\n', '       Mutter and mumble low,\\n', '     And hither and thither fly;\\n', '       Mere puppets they, who come and go\\n', '     At bidding of vast formless things\\n', '       That shift the scenery to and fro,\\n', '     Flapping from out their Condor wings\\n', '       Invisible Wo!\\n', '\\n', '     That motley drama!--oh, be sure\\n', '       It shall not be forgot!\\n', '     With its Phantom chased forever more,\\n', '       By a crowd that seize it not,\\n', '     Through a circle that ever returneth in\\n', '       To the self-same spot,\\n', '     And much of Madness and more of Sin\\n', '       And Horror the soul of the plot.\\n', '\\n', '     But see, amid the mimic rout,\\n', '       The scenic solitude!\\n', '     It writhes!--it writhes!--with mortal pangs\\n', '       The mimes become its food,\\n', '     And the seraphs sob at vermin fangs\\n', '       In human gore imbued.\\n', '\\n', '     Out--out are the lights--out all!\\n', '       And over each quivering form,\\n', '     The curtain, a funeral pall,\\n', '       Comes down with the rush of a storm,\\n', '     And the angels, all pallid and wan,\\n', '       Uprising, unveiling, affirm\\n', '     That the play is the tragedy, “Man,”\\n', '        And its hero the Conqueror Worm.\\n', '\\n', 'so?--shall this Conqueror be not once conquered? Are we not part and\\n', 'parcel in Thee? Who--who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its\\n', 'vigor?

And as she breathed her\\n', 'bent to them my ear and distinguished, again, the concluding words of\\n', 'the passage in Glanvill--“Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto\\n', 'death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.”\\n', '\\n', 'longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and\\n', 'wealth. Ligeia had brought me far more, very far more than ordinarily\\n', 'falls to the lot of mortals. After a few months, therefore, of weary and\\n', 'fair England. The gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building, the\\n', 'almost savage aspect of the domain, the many melancholy and time-honored\\n', 'memories connected with both, had much in unison with the feelings of\\n', 'utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and unsocial\\n', 'region of the country. Yet although the external abbey, with its verdant\\n', 'a child-like perversity, and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating\\n', 'my sorrows, to a display of more than regal magnificence within.--For\\n', 'of incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and\\n', 'fantastic draperies, in the solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild\\n', 'cornices and furniture, in the Bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted\\n', 'labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my dreams. But these\\n', 'led from the altar as my bride--as the successor of the unforgotten\\n', 'Ligeia--the fair-haired and blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion, of\\n', 'Tremaine.\\n', '\\n', 'There is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of\\n', 'that bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me. Where were the\\n', 'souls of the haughty family of the bride, when, through thirst of gold,\\n', 'they permitted to pass the threshold of an apartment so bedecked, a\\n', 'moment--and here there was no system, no keeping, in the fantastic\\n', 'display, to take hold upon the memory. The room lay in a high turret of\\n', 'the castellated abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and of capacious\\n', 'size. Occupying the whole southern face of the pentagon was the sole\\n', 'window--an immense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice--a single pane,\\n', 'and tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon,\\n', 'passing through it, fell with a ghastly lustre on the objects within.\\n', 'Over the upper portion of this huge window, extended the trellice-work\\n', 'of an aged vine, which clambered up the massy walls of the turret. The\\n', 'ceiling, of gloomy-looking oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and\\n', 'elaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a\\n', 'semi-Gothic, semi-Druidical device. From out the most central recess of\\n', 'this melancholy vaulting, depended, by a single chain of gold with long\\n', 'links, a huge censer of the same metal, Saracenic in pattern, and with\\n', 'many perforations so contrived that there writhed in and out of them,\\n', 'as if endued with a serpent vitality, a continual succession of\\n', 'parti-colored fires.\\n', '\\n', 'Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were in\\n', 'various stations about--and there was the couch, too--bridal couch--of\\n', 'an Indian model, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony, with a\\n', 'pall-like canopy above. In each of the angles of the chamber stood on\\n', 'end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite, from the tombs of the kings\\n', 'over against Luxor, with their aged lids full of immemorial sculpture.\\n', 'But in the draping of the apartment lay, alas! the chief phantasy of\\n', 'all. The lofty walls, gigantic in height--even unproportionably\\n', 'so--were hung from summit to foot, in vast folds, with a heavy and\\n', 'massive-looking tapestry--tapestry of a material which was found alike\\n', 'as a carpet on the floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the\\n', 'ebony bed, as a canopy for the bed, and as the gorgeous volutes of the\\n', 'curtains which partially shaded the window. The material was the richest\\n', 'cloth of gold. It was spotted all over, at irregular intervals, with\\n', 'arabesque figures, about a foot in diameter, and wrought upon the cloth\\n', 'in patterns of the most jetty black. But these figures partook of the\\n', 'true character of the arabesque only when regarded from a single point\\n', 'of view. By a contrivance now common, and indeed traceable to a very\\n', 'remote period of antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. To one\\n', 'entering the room, they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities; but\\n', 'upon a farther advance, this appearance gradually departed; and step by\\n', 'step, as the visitor moved his station in the chamber, he saw himself\\n', 'surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which belong to\\n', 'the superstition of the Norman, or arise in the guilty slumbers of the\\n', 'monk. The phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial\\n', 'introduction of a strong continual current of wind behind the\\n', 'draperies--giving a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole.\\n', '\\n', 'the Lady of Tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the first month of our\\n', 'marriage--passed them with but little disquietude. That my wife dreaded\\n', 'the fierce moodiness of my temper--that she shunned me and loved me but\\n', 'to man. My memory flew back, (oh, with what intensity of regret!) to\\n', 'in recollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty, her\\n', 'ethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love. Now, then, did\\n', 'my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her own.\\n', 'silence of the night, or among the sheltered recesses of the glens\\n', 'by day, as if, through the wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the\\n', 'the pathway she had abandoned--ah, could it be forever?--upon the earth.\\n', '\\n', 'About the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the Lady\\n', 'Rowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which her recovery was\\n', 'slow. The fever which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy; and\\n', 'in her perturbed state of half-slumber, she spoke of sounds, and of\\n', 'had no origin save in the distemper of her fancy, or perhaps in the\\n', 'phantasmagoric influences of the chamber itself. She became at length\\n', 'convalescent--finally well. Yet but a brief period elapsed, ere a second\\n', 'more violent disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering; and from\\n', 'this attack her frame, at all times feeble, never altogether recovered.\\n', 'Her illnesses were, after this epoch, of alarming character, and of more\\n', 'alarming recurrence, defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions\\n', 'of her physicians. With the increase of the chronic disease which\\n', 'had thus, apparently, taken too sure hold upon her constitution to\\n', 'increase in the nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her\\n', 'excitability by trivial causes of fear. She spoke again, and now more\\n', 'frequently and pertinaciously, of the sounds--of the slight sounds--and\\n', 'of the unusual motions among the tapestries, to which she had formerly\\n', 'alluded.\\n', '\\n', 'One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this\\n', 'distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention. She\\n', 'with feelings half of anxiety, half of vague terror, the workings of her\\n', 'the ottomans of India. She partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low\\n', 'inarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations of the figures\\n', 'upon the wall, were but the natural effects of that customary rushing of\\n', 'the wind. But a deadly pallor, overspreading her face, had proved to me\\n', 'that my exertions to reassure her would be fruitless. She appeared to\\n', 'was deposited a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her\\n', 'physicians, and hastened across the chamber to procure it. But, as\\n', 'that there lay upon the golden carpet, in the very middle of the rich\\n', 'lustre thrown from the censer, a shadow--a faint, indefinite shadow of\\n', 'angelic aspect--such as might be fancied for the shadow of a shade.\\n', 'heeded these things but little, nor spoke of them to Rowena. Having\\n', 'ottoman near me, with my eyes fastened upon her person. It was then that\\n', 'near the couch; and in a second thereafter, as Rowena was in the act\\n', 'saw, fall within the goblet, as if from some invisible spring in the\\n', 'atmosphere of the room, three or four large drops of a brilliant and\\n', 'imagination, rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady, by the\\n', 'opium, and by the hour.\\n', '\\n', 'subsequent to the fall of the ruby-drops, a rapid change for the worse\\n', 'took place in the disorder of my wife; so that, on the third subsequent\\n', 'night, the hands of her menials prepared her for the tomb, and on the\\n', 'which had received her as my bride.--Wild visions, opium-engendered,\\n', 'sarcophagi in the angles of the room, upon the varying figures of the\\n', 'drapery, and upon the writhing of the parti-colored fires in the censer\\n', 'seen the faint traces of the shadow. It was there, however, no longer;\\n', 'and rigid figure upon the bed. Then rushed upon me a thousand memories\\n', 'of Ligeia--and then came back upon my heart, with the turbulent violence\\n', 'her thus enshrouded. The night waned; and still, with a bosom full of\\n', 'upon the body of Rowena.\\n', '\\n', 'taken no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very distinct,\\n', 'to detect any motion in the corpse--but there was not the slightest\\n', 'perseveringly kept my attention riveted upon the body. Many minutes\\n', 'elapsed before any circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the\\n', 'mystery. At length it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and\\n', 'barely noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks,\\n', 'and along the sunken small veins of the eyelids. Through a species of\\n', 'unutterable horror and awe, for which the language of mortality has no\\n', 'precipitate in our preparations--that Rowena still lived. It was\\n', 'necessary that some immediate exertion be made; yet the turret was\\n', 'altogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by the\\n', 'back the spirit ill hovering. In a short period it was certain, however,\\n', 'that a relapse had taken place; the color disappeared from both eyelid\\n', 'and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than that of marble; the lips\\n', 'became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly expression\\n', 'of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the\\n', 'surface of the body; and all the usual rigorous illness immediately\\n', 'been so startlingly aroused, and again gave myself up to passionate\\n', 'waking visions of Ligeia.\\n', '\\n', 'listened--in extremity of horror. The sound came again--it was a sigh.\\n', 'a minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright line of the pearly\\n', 'teeth. Amazement now struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which\\n', 'succeeded in nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had\\n', 'pointed out. There was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the\\n', 'cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame; there\\n', 'was even a slight pulsation at the heart. The lady lived; and with\\n', 'and bathed the temples and the hands, and used every exertion which\\n', 'experience, and no little medical reading, could suggest. But in vain.\\n', 'Suddenly, the color fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the\\n', 'expression of the dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole\\n', 'body took upon itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the intense\\n', 'rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of\\n', 'that which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb.\\n', '\\n', 'time, until near the period of the gray dawn, this hideous drama of\\n', 'revivification was repeated; how each terrific relapse was only into a\\n', 'sterner and apparently more irredeemable death; how each agony wore the\\n', 'aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe; and how each struggle was\\n', 'of the corpse? Let me hurry to a conclusion.\\n', '\\n', 'The greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who had\\n', 'been dead, once again stirred--and now more vigorously than hitherto,\\n', 'although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in its utter\\n', 'remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a helpless prey to a whirl of\\n', 'violent emotions, of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible,\\n', 'vigorously than before. The hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy\\n', 'into the countenance--the limbs relaxed--and, save that the eyelids were\\n', 'yet pressed heavily together, and that the bandages and draperies of the\\n', 'have dreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly, the fetters of\\n', 'at least doubt no longer, when, arising from the bed, tottering, with\\n', 'feeble steps, with closed eyes, and with the manner of one bewildered in\\n', 'a dream, the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into\\n', 'the middle of the apartment.\\n', '\\n', 'connected with the air, the stature, the demeanor of the figure, rushing\\n', 'stirred not--but gazed upon the apparition. There was a mad disorder\\n', 'in my thoughts--a tumult unappeasable. Could it, indeed, be the\\n', 'living Rowena who confronted me? Could it indeed be Rowena at all--the\\n', 'fair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine? Why, why\\n', 'might it not be the mouth of the breathing Lady of Tremaine? And the\\n', 'cheeks--there were the roses as in her noon of life--yes, these might\\n', 'indeed be the fair cheeks of the living Lady of Tremaine. And the chin,\\n', 'with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?--but had she then\\n', 'grown taller since her malady? What inexpressible madness seized me with\\n', 'touch, she let fall from her head, unloosened, the ghastly cerements\\n', 'which had confined it, and there streamed forth, into the rushing\\n', 'atmosphere of the chamber, huge masses of long and dishevelled hair; it\\n', 'was blacker than the raven wings of the midnight! And now slowly opened\\n', 'the eyes of the figure which stood before me. “Here then, at least,”\\n', 'full, and the black, and the wild eyes--of my lost love--of the lady--of\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '     Itself, by itself, solely, one everlasting, and single.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Morella. Thrown by accident into her society many years ago, my soul\\n', 'from our first meeting, burned with fires it had never before known; but\\n', 'the fires were not of Eros, and bitter and tormenting to my spirit was\\n', 'meaning or regulate their vague intensity. Yet we met; and fate bound us\\n', 'love. She, however, shunned society, and, attaching herself to me alone\\n', 'rendered me happy. It is a happiness to wonder; it is a happiness to\\n', 'dream.\\n', '\\n', 'on account of her Presburg education, she placed before me a number of\\n', 'those mystical writings which are usually considered the mere dross of\\n', 'were her favourite and constant study--and that in process of time\\n', 'they became my own, should be attributed to the simple but effectual\\n', 'influence of habit and example.\\n', '\\n', 'am greatly mistaken, either in my deeds or in my thoughts. Persuaded\\n', 'entered with an unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies.\\n', 'spirit enkindling within me--would Morella place her cold hand upon my\\n', 'own, and rake up from the ashes of a dead philosophy some low, singular\\n', 'words, whose strange meaning burned themselves in upon my memory. And\\n', 'music of her voice, until at length its melody was tainted with terror,\\n', 'inwardly at those too unearthly tones. And thus, joy suddenly faded into\\n', 'horror, and the most beautiful became the most hideous, as Hinnon became\\n', 'Ge-Henna.\\n', '\\n', 'It is unnecessary to state the exact character of those disquisitions\\n', 'long a time, almost the sole conversation of Morella and myself. By\\n', 'the learned in what might be termed theological morality they will be\\n', 'readily conceived, and by the unlearned they would, at all events,\\n', 'be little understood. The wild Pantheism of Fichte; the modified\\n', 'Paliggenedia of the Pythagoreans; and, above all, the doctrines of\\n', 'Identity as urged by Schelling, were generally the points of discussion\\n', 'presenting the most of beauty to the imaginative Morella. That identity\\n', 'in the saneness of rational being. And since by person we understand an\\n', 'intelligent essence having reason, and since there is a consciousness\\n', 'which always accompanies thinking, it is this which makes us all to\\n', 'be that which we call ourselves, thereby distinguishing us from\\n', 'other beings that think, and giving us our personal identity. But the\\n', 'principium indivduationis, the notion of that identity which at death\\n', 'is or is not lost for ever, was to me, at all times, a consideration of\\n', 'intense interest; not more from the perplexing and exciting nature of\\n', 'its consequences, than from the marked and agitated manner in which\\n', 'Morella mentioned them.\\n', '\\n', 'But, indeed, the time had now arrived when the mystery of my wife’s\\n', 'wan fingers, nor the low tone of her musical language, nor the lustre\\n', 'of her melancholy eyes. And she knew all this, but did not upbraid; she\\n', 'seemed conscious of my weakness or my folly, and, smiling, called it\\n', 'fate. She seemed also conscious of a cause, to me unknown, for the\\n', 'gradual alienation of my regard; but she gave me no hint or token of\\n', 'its nature. Yet was she woman, and pined away daily. In time the crimson\\n', 'spot settled steadily upon the cheek, and the blue veins upon the pale\\n', 'forehead became prominent; and one instant my nature melted into pity,\\n', 'sickened and became giddy with the giddiness of one who gazes downward\\n', 'into some dreary and unfathomable abyss.\\n', '\\n', 'its tenement of clay for many days, for many weeks and irksome months,\\n', 'furious through delay, and, with the heart of a fiend, cursed the days\\n', 'and the hours and the bitter moments, which seemed to lengthen and\\n', 'lengthen as her gentle life declined, like shadows in the dying of the\\n', 'day.\\n', '\\n', 'But one autumnal evening, when the winds lay still in heaven, Morella\\n', 'called me to her bedside. There was a dim mist over all the earth, and\\n', 'a warm glow upon the waters, and amid the rich October leaves of the\\n', 'forest, a rainbow from the firmament had surely fallen.\\n', '\\n', 'either to live or die. It is a fair day for the sons of earth and\\n', 'life--ah, more fair for the daughters of heaven and death!”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '“Morella!”\\n', '\\n', '“The days have never been when thou couldst love me--but her whom in\\n', 'life thou didst abhor, in death thou shalt adore.”\\n', '\\n', '“Morella!”\\n', '\\n', 'how little!--which thou didst feel for me, Morella. And when my spirit\\n', 'departs shall the child live--thy child and mine, Morella’s. But thy\\n', 'days shall be days of sorrow--that sorrow which is the most lasting of\\n', 'impressions, as the cypress is the most enduring of trees. For the hours\\n', 'of thy happiness are over and joy is not gathered twice in a life, as\\n', 'the roses of Paestum twice in a year. Thou shalt no longer, then, play\\n', 'the Teian with time, but, being ignorant of the myrtle and the vine,\\n', 'thou shalt bear about with thee thy shroud on the earth, as do the\\n', 'Moslemin at Mecca.”\\n', '\\n', 'away her face upon the pillow and a slight tremor coming over her limbs,\\n', '\\n', 'Yet, as she had foretold, her child, to which in dying she had given\\n', 'birth, which breathed not until the mother breathed no more, her child,\\n', 'a daughter, lived. And she grew strangely in stature and intellect, and\\n', 'denizen of earth.\\n', '\\n', 'But, ere long the heaven of this pure affection became darkened, and\\n', 'grew strangely in stature and intelligence. Strange, indeed, was her\\n', 'rapid increase in bodily size, but terrible, oh! terrible were the\\n', 'tumultuous thoughts which crowded upon me while watching the development\\n', 'in the conceptions of the child the adult powers and faculties of the\\n', 'woman? when the lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy? and\\n', 'it off from those perceptions which trembled to receive it, is it to be\\n', 'wondered at that suspicions, of a nature fearful and exciting, crept in\\n', 'upon my spirit, or that my thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild tales\\n', 'scrutiny of the world a being whom destiny compelled me to adore, and\\n', 'in the rigorous seclusion of my home, watched with an agonizing anxiety\\n', 'over all which concerned the beloved.\\n', '\\n', 'mild, and eloquent face, and poured over her maturing form, day after\\n', 'the melancholy and the dead. And hourly grew darker these shadows of\\n', 'similitude, and more full, and more definite, and more perplexing, and\\n', 'more hideously terrible in their aspect. For that her smile was like her\\n', 'often looked down into the depths of my soul with Morella’s own intense\\n', 'and bewildering meaning. And in the contour of the high forehead, and\\n', 'in the ringlets of the silken hair, and in the wan fingers which buried\\n', 'themselves therein, and in the sad musical tones of her speech, and\\n', 'above all--oh, above all, in the phrases and expressions of the dead on\\n', 'and horror, for a worm that would not die.\\n', '\\n', 'Thus passed away two lustra of her life, and as yet my daughter\\n', 'remained nameless upon the earth. “My child,” and “my love,” were the\\n', 'designations usually prompted by a father’s affection, and the rigid\\n', 'seclusion of her days precluded all other intercourse. Morella’s name\\n', 'daughter, it was impossible to speak. Indeed, during the brief period of\\n', 'her existence, the latter had received no impressions from the outward\\n', 'world, save such as might have been afforded by the narrow limits of her\\n', 'privacy. But at length the ceremony of baptism presented to my mind,\\n', 'in its unnerved and agitated condition, a present deliverance from the\\n', 'And many titles of the wise and beautiful, of old and modern times, of\\n', 'my own and foreign lands, came thronging to my lips, with many, many\\n', 'fair titles of the gentle, and the happy, and the good. What prompted\\n', 'me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead? What demon urged me to\\n', 'breathe that sound, which in its very recollection was wont to make ebb\\n', 'the purple blood in torrents from the temples to the heart? What fiend\\n', 'spoke from the recesses of my soul, when amid those dim aisles, and in\\n', 'the syllables--Morella? What more than fiend convulsed the features of\\n', 'my child, and overspread them with hues of death, as starting at that\\n', 'scarcely audible sound, she turned her glassy eyes from the earth to\\n', 'heaven, and falling prostrate on the black slabs of our ancestral vault,\\n', '\\n', 'Distinct, coldly, calmly distinct, fell those few simple sounds within\\n', 'my ear, and thence like molten lead rolled hissingly into my brain.\\n', 'Years--years may pass away, but the memory of that epoch never. Nor was\\n', 'or place, and the stars of my fate faded from heaven, and therefore the\\n', 'earth grew dark, and its figures passed by me like flitting shadows,\\n', 'breathed but one sound within my ears, and the ripples upon the sea\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'young gentleman was remarkable in every respect, and excited in me a\\n', 'something which perplexed me in no little degree. He certainly seemed\\n', 'young--and he made a point of speaking about his youth--yet there were\\n', 'years of age. But in no regard was he more peculiar than in his personal\\n', 'appearance. He was singularly tall and thin. He stooped much. His limbs\\n', 'were exceedingly long and emaciated. His forehead was broad and low. His\\n', 'complexion was absolutely bloodless. His mouth was large and flexible,\\n', 'before seen teeth in a human head. The expression of his smile,\\n', 'however, was by no means unpleasing, as might be supposed; but it had\\n', 'no variation whatever. It was one of profound melancholy--of a phaseless\\n', 'and unceasing gloom. His eyes were abnormally large, and round like\\n', 'those of a cat. The pupils, too, upon any accession or diminution of\\n', 'light, underwent contraction or dilation, just such as is observed in\\n', 'the feline tribe. In moments of excitement the orbs grew bright to a\\n', 'degree almost inconceivable; seeming to emit luminous rays, not of a\\n', 'reflected but of an intrinsic lustre, as does a candle or the sun; yet\\n', 'their ordinary condition was so totally vapid, filmy, and dull as to\\n', 'convey the idea of the eyes of a long-interred corpse.\\n', '\\n', 'These peculiarities of person appeared to cause him much annoyance, and\\n', 'he was continually alluding to them in a sort of half explanatory,\\n', 'wore off. It seemed to be his design rather to insinuate than directly\\n', 'to assert that, physically, he had not always been what he was--that\\n', 'a long series of neuralgic attacks had reduced him from a condition of\\n', 'past he had been attended by a physician, named Templeton--an old\\n', 'gentleman, perhaps seventy years of age--whom he had first encountered\\n', 'at Saratoga, and from whose attention, while there, he either received,\\n', 'or fancied that he received, great benefit. The result was that Bedloe,\\n', 'who was wealthy, had made an arrangement with Dr. Templeton, by\\n', 'which the latter, in consideration of a liberal annual allowance, had\\n', 'consented to devote his time and medical experience exclusively to the\\n', 'care of the invalid.\\n', '\\n', 'Doctor Templeton had been a traveller in his younger days, and at Paris\\n', 'had become a convert, in great measure, to the doctrines of Mesmer. It\\n', 'was altogether by means of magnetic remedies that he had succeeded in\\n', 'alleviating the acute pains of his patient; and this success had very\\n', 'naturally inspired the latter with a certain degree of confidence in the\\n', 'opinions from which the remedies had been educed. The Doctor, however,\\n', 'like all enthusiasts, had struggled hard to make a thorough convert of\\n', 'his pupil, and finally so far gained his point as to induce the sufferer\\n', 'to submit to numerous experiments. By a frequent repetition of these, a\\n', 'result had arisen, which of late days has become so common as to attract\\n', 'Templeton and Bedloe there had grown up, little by little, a very\\n', 'prepared to assert, however, that this rapport extended beyond the\\n', 'limits of the simple sleep-producing power, but this power itself had\\n', 'attained great intensity. At the first attempt to induce the magnetic\\n', 'somnolency, the mesmerist entirely failed. In the fifth or sixth he\\n', 'succeeded very partially, and after long continued effort. Only at the\\n', 'twelfth was the triumph complete. After this the will of the patient\\n', 'acquainted with the two, sleep was brought about almost instantaneously\\n', 'by the mere volition of the operator, even when the invalid was unaware\\n', 'of his presence. It is only now, in the year 1845, when similar miracles\\n', 'apparent impossibility as a matter of serious fact.\\n', '\\n', 'The temperature of Bedloe was, in the highest degree sensitive,\\n', 'excitable, enthusiastic. His imagination was singularly vigorous and\\n', 'creative; and no doubt it derived additional force from the habitual use\\n', 'of morphine, which he swallowed in great quantity, and without which he\\n', 'would have found it impossible to exist. It was his practice to take\\n', 'a very large dose of it immediately after breakfast each morning--or,\\n', 'rather, immediately after a cup of strong coffee, for he ate nothing in\\n', 'the forenoon--and then set forth alone, or attended only by a dog, upon\\n', 'a long ramble among the chain of wild and dreary hills that lie westward\\n', 'and southward of Charlottesville, and are there dignified by the title\\n', 'of the Ragged Mountains.\\n', '\\n', 'Upon a dim, warm, misty day, toward the close of November, and during\\n', 'the strange interregnum of the seasons which in America is termed the\\n', 'Indian Summer, Mr. Bedloe departed as usual for the hills. The day\\n', 'passed, and still he did not return.\\n', '\\n', 'About eight o’clock at night, having become seriously alarmed at his\\n', 'protracted absence, we were about setting out in search of him, when he\\n', 'unexpectedly made his appearance, in health no worse than usual, and\\n', 'in rather more than ordinary spirits. The account which he gave of his\\n', 'expedition, and of the events which had detained him, was a singular one\\n', 'indeed.\\n', '\\n', '“You will remember,” said he, “that it was about nine in the morning\\n', 'mountains, and, about ten, entered a gorge which was entirely new to\\n', 'which presented itself on all sides, although scarcely entitled to be\\n', 'called grand, had about it an indescribable and to me a delicious aspect\\n', 'had been trodden never before by the foot of a human being. So\\n', 'entirely secluded, and in fact inaccessible, except through a series\\n', 'of accidents, is the entrance of the ravine, that it is by no means\\n', 'sole adventurer who had ever penetrated its recesses.\\n', '\\n', '“The thick and peculiar mist, or smoke, which distinguishes the Indian\\n', 'Summer, and which now hung heavily over all objects, served, no doubt,\\n', 'to deepen the vague impressions which these objects created. So dense\\n', 'yards of the path before me. This path was excessively sinuous, and\\n', 'effect--that of enduing all the external world with an intensity of\\n', 'interest. In the quivering of a leaf--in the hue of a blade of grass--in\\n', 'the shape of a trefoil--in the humming of a bee--in the gleaming of a\\n', 'dew-drop--in the breathing of the wind--in the faint odors that came\\n', 'from the forest--there came a whole universe of suggestion--a gay and\\n', 'motley train of rhapsodical and immethodical thought.\\n', '\\n', 'to an absolute groping of the way. And now an indescribable uneasiness\\n', 'strange stories told about these Ragged Hills, and of the uncouth and\\n', 'vague fancies oppressed and disconcerted me--fancies the more\\n', 'distressing because vague. Very suddenly my attention was arrested by\\n', 'the loud beating of a drum.\\n', '\\n', 'of the Archangel. But a new and still more astounding source of interest\\n', 'and perplexity arose. There came a wild rattling or jingling sound, as\\n', 'if of a bunch of large keys, and upon the instant a dusky-visaged and\\n', 'half-naked man rushed past me with a shriek. He came so close to my\\n', 'an instrument composed of an assemblage of steel rings, and shook them\\n', 'vigorously as he ran. Scarcely had he disappeared in the mist before,\\n', 'panting after him, with open mouth and glaring eyes, there darted a huge\\n', '\\n', '“The sight of this monster rather relieved than heightened my\\n', 'and my head and neck. This seemed to dissipate the equivocal sensations\\n', 'proceeded steadily and complacently on my unknown way.\\n', '\\n', '“At length, quite overcome by exertion, and by a certain oppressive\\n', 'there came a feeble gleam of sunshine, and the shadow of the leaves of\\n', 'the tree fell faintly but definitely upon the grass. At this shadow\\n', '\\n', 'perfect command of my senses--and these senses now brought to my soul\\n', 'a world of novel and singular sensation. The heat became all at once\\n', 'like that arising from a full, but gently flowing river, came to my\\n', 'ears, intermingled with the peculiar hum of multitudinous human voices.\\n', '\\n', 'attempt to describe, a strong and brief gust of wind bore off the\\n', 'incumbent fog as if by the wand of an enchanter.\\n', '\\n', 'vast plain, through which wound a majestic river. On the margin of this\\n', 'river stood an Eastern-looking city, such as we read of in the Arabian\\n', 'Tales, but of a character even more singular than any there described.\\n', 'perceive its every nook and corner, as if delineated on a map. The\\n', 'streets seemed innumerable, and crossed each other irregularly in\\n', 'all directions, but were rather long winding alleys than streets, and\\n', 'absolutely swarmed with inhabitants. The houses were wildly picturesque.\\n', 'On every hand was a wilderness of balconies, of verandas, of minarets,\\n', 'of shrines, and fantastically carved oriels. Bazaars abounded; and\\n', 'in these were displayed rich wares in infinite variety and\\n', 'profusion--silks, muslins, the most dazzling cutlery, the most\\n', 'magnificent jewels and gems. Besides these things, were seen, on all\\n', 'sides, banners and palanquins, litters with stately dames close veiled,\\n', 'elephants gorgeously caparisoned, idols grotesquely hewn, drums,\\n', 'banners, and gongs, spears, silver and gilded maces. And amid the\\n', 'crowd, and the clamor, and the general intricacy and confusion--amid\\n', 'the million of black and yellow men, turbaned and robed, and of flowing\\n', 'beard, there roamed a countless multitude of holy filleted bulls, while\\n', 'vast legions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered, chattering and\\n', 'shrieking, about the cornices of the mosques, or clung to the minarets\\n', 'and oriels. From the swarming streets to the banks of the river, there\\n', 'descended innumerable flights of steps leading to bathing places, while\\n', 'the river itself seemed to force a passage with difficulty through the\\n', 'vast fleets of deeply-burthened ships that far and wide encountered\\n', 'its surface. Beyond the limits of the city arose, in frequent majestic\\n', 'groups, the palm and the cocoa, with other gigantic and weird trees of\\n', 'vast age, and here and there might be seen a field of rice, the thatched\\n', 'hut of a peasant, a tank, a stray temple, a gypsy camp, or a solitary\\n', 'graceful maiden taking her way, with a pitcher upon her head, to the\\n', 'banks of the magnificent river.\\n', '\\n', 'of the unmistakable idiosyncrasy of the dream. All was rigorously\\n', 'Now, when one dreams, and, in the dream, suspects that he dreams, the\\n', 'suspicion never fails to confirm itself, and the sleeper is almost\\n', 'immediately aroused. Thus Novalis errs not in saying that ‘we are near\\n', 'describe it, without my suspecting it as a dream, then a dream it might\\n', 'absolutely have been, but, occurring as it did, and suspected and tested\\n', '\\n', 'proceed. You arose and descended into the city.”\\n', '\\n', 'avenue, all in the same direction, and exhibiting in every action the\\n', 'became intensely imbued with personal interest in what was going on.\\n', 'understanding what it was. Against the crowd which environed me,\\n', 'them, and, swiftly, by a circuitous path, reached and entered the city.\\n', 'clad in garments half-Indian, half-European, and officered by gentlemen\\n', 'in a uniform partly British, were engaged, at great odds, with the\\n', 'the nervous ferocity of despair. We were soon overpowered by numbers,\\n', 'and driven to seek refuge in a species of kiosk. Here we barricaded\\n', 'ourselves, and, for the present were secure. From a loop-hole near the\\n', 'surrounding and assaulting a gay palace that overhung the river.\\n', 'Presently, from an upper window of this place, there descended an\\n', 'effeminate-looking person, by means of a string made of the turbans of\\n', 'bank of the river.\\n', '\\n', 'but energetic words to my companions, and, having succeeded in gaining\\n', 'over a few of them to my purpose made a frantic sally from the kiosk.\\n', 'We rushed amid the crowd that surrounded it. They retreated, at first,\\n', 'before us. They rallied, fought madly, and retreated again. In the\\n', 'mean time we were borne far from the kiosk, and became bewildered and\\n', 'entangled among the narrow streets of tall, overhanging houses, into\\n', 'the recesses of which the sun had never been able to shine. The rabble\\n', 'pressed impetuously upon us, harrassing us with their spears, and\\n', 'overwhelming us with flights of arrows. These latter were very\\n', 'remarkable, and resembled in some respects the writhing creese of the\\n', 'Malay. They were made to imitate the body of a creeping serpent, and\\n', 'were long and black, with a poisoned barb. One of them struck me upon\\n', 'a dream. You are not prepared to maintain that you are dead?”\\n', '\\n', 'Bedloe in reply, but, to my astonishment, he hesitated, trembled, became\\n', 'sat erect and rigid in his chair--his teeth chattered, and his eyes were\\n', 'starting from their sockets. “Proceed!” he at length said hoarsely to\\n', 'Bedloe.\\n', '\\n', '“For many minutes,” continued the latter, “my sole sentiment--my sole\\n', 'feeling--was that of darkness and nonentity, with the consciousness of\\n', 'death. At length there seemed to pass a violent and sudden shock through\\n', 'my soul, as if of electricity. With it came the sense of elasticity and\\n', 'presence. The crowd had departed. The tumult had ceased. The city was\\n', 'in comparative repose. Beneath me lay my corpse, with the arrow in my\\n', 'temple, the whole head greatly swollen and disfigured. But all these\\n', 'appeared to be impelled into motion, and flitted buoyantly out of the\\n', 'became my original self, and bent my steps eagerly homeward--but the\\n', 'past had not lost the vividness of the real--and not now, even for an\\n', '\\n', '“Nor was it,” said Templeton, with an air of deep solemnity, “yet it\\n', 'would be difficult to say how otherwise it should be termed. Let us\\n', 'suppose only, that the soul of the man of to-day is upon the verge of\\n', 'some stupendous psychal discoveries. Let us content ourselves with this\\n', 'an unaccountable sentiment of horror has hitherto prevented me from\\n', 'showing.”\\n', '\\n', 'extraordinary character, but its effect upon Bedloe was prodigious. He\\n', 'nearly fainted as he gazed. And yet it was but a miniature portrait--a\\n', 'miraculously accurate one, to be sure--of his own very remarkable\\n', '\\n', '“You will perceive,” said Templeton, “the date of this picture--it\\n', 'is here, scarcely visible, in this corner--1780. In this year was the\\n', 'portrait taken. It is the likeness of a dead friend--a Mr. Oldeb--to\\n', 'Mr. Bedloe, at Saratoga, it was the miraculous similarity which existed\\n', 'between yourself and the painting which induced me to accost you,\\n', 'to seek your friendship, and to bring about those arrangements which\\n', 'resulted in my becoming your constant companion.

The riots, the combat, the massacre,\\n', 'were the actual events of the insurrection of Cheyte Sing, which took\\n', 'place in 1780, when Hastings was put in imminent peril of his life. The\\n', 'man escaping by the string of turbans was Cheyte Sing himself. The party\\n', 'in the kiosk were sepoys and British officers, headed by Hastings.

In an excursion to the Ragged Mountains, a few\\n', 'days since, a slight cold and fever were contracted, attended with\\n', 'great determination of blood to the head. To relieve this, Dr. Templeton\\n', 'resorted to topical bleeding. Leeches were applied to the temples.

This creature fastened itself upon a small artery in\\n', 'the right temple. Its close resemblance to the medicinal leech caused\\n', 'the mistake to be overlooked until too late.\\n', '\\n', 'distinguished from the medicinal leech by its blackness, and especially\\n', 'by its writhing or vermicular motions, which very nearly resemble those\\n', 'of a snake.”\\n', '\\n', 'topic of this remarkable accident, when it occurred to me to ask how it\\n', 'happened that the name of the deceased had been given as Bedlo.\\n', '\\n', 'always supposed the name to be written with an e at the end.”\\n', '\\n', '“Authority?--no,” he replied. “It is a mere typographical error.

Still,\\n', 'contour of the back portion of the head. After some minutes, as if urged\\n', 'face again around and again encountered my burning gaze. Her large dark\\n', 'eyes fell instantly, and a deep blush mantled her cheek. But what was my\\n', 'astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second time\\n', 'avert her head, but that she actually took from her girdle a double\\n', 'eyeglass--elevated it--adjusted it--and then regarded me through it,\\n', 'intently and deliberately, for the space of several minutes.\\n', '\\n', 'thoroughly astounded--astounded only--not offended or disgusted in the\\n', 'slightest degree; although an action so bold in any other woman would\\n', 'have been likely to offend or disgust. But the whole thing was done with\\n', 'so much quietude--so much nonchalance--so much repose--with so\\n', 'evident an air of the highest breeding, in short--that nothing of\\n', 'mere effrontery was perceptible, and my sole sentiments were those of\\n', 'admiration and surprise.\\n', '\\n', 'satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person, and was withdrawing\\n', 'the instrument, when, as if struck by a second thought, she resumed\\n', 'it, and so continued to regard me with fixed attention for the space of\\n', '\\n', 'This action, so remarkable in an American theatre, attracted very\\n', 'general observation, and gave rise to an indefinite movement, or buzz,\\n', 'among the audience, which for a moment filled me with confusion, but\\n', 'produced no visible effect upon the countenance of Madame Lalande.\\n', '\\n', 'Having satisfied her curiosity--if such it was--she dropped the glass,\\n', 'and quietly gave her attention again to the stage; her profile now being\\n', 'convinced that the lady, while pretending to look at the stage was, in\\n', 'fact, attentively regarding myself. It is needless to say what effect\\n', 'this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had upon my\\n', 'excitable mind.\\n', '\\n', 'Having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour, the fair\\n', 'object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended her, and\\n', 'conversation had reference to myself.\\n', '\\n', 'Upon its conclusion, Madame Lalande again turned toward the stage, and,\\n', 'for a few minutes, seemed absorbed in the performance. At the expiration\\n', 'seeing her unfold, for the second time, the eye-glass which hung at her\\n', 'side, fully confront me as before, and, disregarding the renewed buzz\\n', 'of the audience, survey me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous\\n', 'composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my soul.\\n', '\\n', 'This extraordinary behavior, by throwing me into a perfect fever of\\n', 'excitement--into an absolute delirium of love--served rather to embolden\\n', 'everything but the presence and the majestic loveliness of the vision\\n', 'of Madame Lalande, and, upon the instant, made a slight but unmistakable\\n', 'bow.\\n', '\\n', 'She blushed very deeply--then averted her eyes--then slowly and\\n', 'cautiously looked around, apparently to see if my rash action had been\\n', 'noticed--then leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her side.\\n', '\\n', 'expected nothing less than instant exposure; while a vision of pistols\\n', 'upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably through my brain.\\n', 'merely hand the gentleman a play-bill, without speaking, but the reader\\n', 'may form some feeble conception of my astonishment--of my profound\\n', 'amazement--my delirious bewilderment of heart and soul--when, instantly\\n', 'afterward, having again glanced furtively around, she allowed her bright\\n', 'eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own, and then, with a faint\\n', 'smile, disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth, made two distinct,\\n', 'pointed, and unequivocal affirmative inclinations of the head.\\n', '\\n', 'It is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy--upon my transport--upon\\n', 'my illimitable ecstasy of heart. If ever man was mad with excess of\\n', '“love at first sight;” and at first sight, too, it had been appreciated\\n', 'and returned.\\n', '\\n', 'lady so beautiful--so wealthy--evidently so accomplished--of so high\\n', 'breeding--of so lofty a position in society--in every regard so entirely\\n', 'returned the enthusiasm of my love, with an enthusiasm as blind--as\\n', 'uncompromising--as uncalculating--as abandoned--and as utterly unbounded\\n', 'as my own! These delicious fancies and reflections, however, were now\\n', 'interrupted by the falling of the drop-curtain. The audience arose; and\\n', 'made every effort to force my way into closer proximity with Madame\\n', 'gave up the chase, and bent my steps homeward; consoling myself for\\n', 'my disappointment in not having been able to touch even the hem of her\\n', 'form, upon the morrow.\\n', '\\n', 'This morrow at last came, that is to say, a day finally dawned upon a\\n', 'long and weary night of impatience; and then the hours until “one” were\\n', 'snail-paced, dreary, and innumerable. But even Stamboul, it is said,\\n', 'shall have an end, and there came an end to this long delay. The clock\\n', 'Talbot.\\n', '\\n', '“Out,” said the footman--Talbot’s own.\\n', '\\n', 'you, my fine fellow, that this thing is thoroughly impossible and\\n', 'impracticable; Mr. Talbot is not out. What do you mean?”\\n', '\\n', '“Nothing, sir; only Mr. Talbot is not in, that’s all. He rode over to\\n', 'town again for a week.”\\n', '\\n', 'wrath, and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the Talbots to the\\n', 'innermost regions of Erebus. It was evident that my considerate friend,\\n', 'il fanatico, had quite forgotten his appointment with myself--had\\n', 'forgotten it as soon as it was made. At no time was he a very scrupulous\\n', 'man of his word. There was no help for it; so smothering my vexation as\\n', 'been in town only a few weeks, and there were very few, therefore, who\\n', 'claimed her personal acquaintance. These few, being still comparatively\\n', 'strangers, could not, or would not, take the liberty of introducing me\\n', 'conversing with a trio of friends upon the all absorbing subject of my\\n', 'heart, it so happened that the subject itself passed by.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '“Surprisingly beautiful!” exclaimed a second.\\n', '\\n', '“An angel upon earth!” ejaculated a third.\\n', '\\n', 'down the street, sat the enchanting vision of the opera, accompanied by\\n', 'the younger lady who had occupied a portion of her box.\\n', '\\n', '“Her companion also wears remarkably well,” said the one of my trio who\\n', 'had spoken first.\\n', '\\n', '“Astonishingly,” said the second; “still quite a brilliant air, but art\\n', 'will do wonders. Upon my word, she looks better than she did at\\n', '\\n', 'she is as a rush-light to the evening star--a glow-worm to Antares.\\n', '\\n', '“Ha! ha! ha!--why, Simpson, you have an astonishing tact at making\\n', 'lines--\\n', '\\n', 'Ninon, Ninon, Ninon a bas--\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'During this little scene, however, one thing had served greatly to\\n', 'she recognized me; and more than this, she had blessed me, by the\\n', 'most seraphic of all imaginable smiles, with no equivocal mark of the\\n', 'recognition.\\n', '\\n', 'such time as Talbot should think proper to return from the country. In\\n', 'the supreme bliss of meeting her, and of exchanging glances with her\\n', 'once again. This did not occur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight.\\n', 'every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the everlasting “Not\\n', 'come home yet” of his footman.\\n', '\\n', 'lately arrived from Paris--might she not suddenly return?--return before\\n', 'Talbot came back--and might she not be thus lost to me forever? The\\n', 'thought was too terrible to bear. Since my future happiness was at\\n', 'address, and the next morning sent her a full and elaborate letter, in\\n', '\\n', 'circumstances of our first meeting--even to the glances which had passed\\n', 'ever penned, with a frank declaration of my worldly circumstances--of my\\n', 'affluence--and with an offer of my heart and of my hand.\\n', '\\n', 'lapse of a century it came.\\n', '\\n', 'a letter from Madame Lalande--the beautiful, the wealthy, the idolized\\n', 'Madame Lalande. Her eyes--her magnificent eyes, had not belied her\\n', 'noble heart. Like a true Frenchwoman as she was she had obeyed the frank\\n', 'dictates of her reason--the generous impulses of her nature--despising\\n', 'the conventional pruderies of the world. She had not scorned my\\n', 'proposals. She had not sheltered herself in silence. She had not\\n', 'returned my letter unopened. She had even sent me, in reply, one penned\\n', 'by her own exquisite fingers. It ran thus:\\n', '\\n', '“Monsieur Simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle tong of\\n', 'not yet ave do opportunite for to--l’etudier.\\n', '\\n', 'ready speak de too moshe?\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'doubt, on its account, a thousand other extravagances that have now\\n', 'escaped my memory. Still Talbot would not return. Alas! could he have\\n', 'formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering his absence had occasioned\\n', 'his friend, would not his sympathizing nature have flown immediately\\n', 'detained by urgent business--but would shortly return. He begged me not\\n', 'to be impatient--to moderate my transports--to read soothing books--to\\n', 'drink nothing stronger than Hock--and to bring the consolations of\\n', 'philosophy to my aid. The fool! if he could not come himself, why, in\\n', 'the name of every thing rational, could he not have enclosed me a\\n', 'forthwith. My letter was returned by that footman, with the following\\n', 'endorsement in pencil. The scoundrel had joined his master in the\\n', 'country:\\n', '\\n', 'back--so thought best to return letter, knowing your handwriting, and as\\n', 'how you is always, more or less, in a hurry.\\n', '\\n', '“Yours sincerely,\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'deities both master and valet:--but there was little use in anger, and\\n', 'no consolation at all in complaint.\\n', '\\n', 'end. Besides, after the correspondence which had passed between us, what\\n', 'be regarded as indecorous by Madame Lalande? Since the affair of\\n', 'discovered that, about twilight, it was her custom to promenade,\\n', 'attended only by a negro in livery, in a public square overlooked by\\n', 'her windows. Here, amid the luxuriant and shadowing groves, in the\\n', 'accosted her.\\n', '\\n', 'assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance. With a presence of mind\\n', 'truly Parisian, she took the cue at once, and, to greet me, held out the\\n', 'most bewitchingly little of hands. The valet at once fell into the\\n', 'rear, and now, with hearts full to overflowing, we discoursed long and\\n', 'unreservedly of our love.\\n', '\\n', 'As Madame Lalande spoke English even less fluently than she wrote it,\\n', 'our conversation was necessarily in French. In this sweet tongue, so\\n', 'consent to an immediate marriage.\\n', '\\n', 'At this impatience she smiled. She urged the old story of decorum--that\\n', 'bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the opportunity for\\n', 'not possess it--thus, again, there was no possibility of concealing the\\n', 'date of our first knowledge of each other. And then she adverted, with a\\n', 'blush, to the extreme recency of this date. To wed immediately would be\\n', 'improper--would be indecorous--would be outre. All this she said with a\\n', 'charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved and convinced\\n', 'me. She went even so far as to accuse me, laughingly, of rashness--of\\n', 'was--what were her prospects, her connections, her standing in society.\\n', 'She begged me, but with a sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed\\n', 'my love an infatuation--a will o’ the wisp--a fancy or fantasy of the\\n', 'moment--a baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination\\n', 'than of the heart. These things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet\\n', 'twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around us--and then, with a\\n', 'gentle pressure of her fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single sweet\\n', 'instant, all the argumentative fabric she had reared.\\n', '\\n', 'and perseveringly of my devotion, of my passion--of her exceeding\\n', 'with a convincing energy, upon the perils that encompass the course\\n', 'of love--that course of true love that never did run smooth--and thus\\n', 'deduced the manifest danger of rendering that course unnecessarily long.\\n', '\\n', 'This latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her\\n', 'determination. She relented; but there was yet an obstacle, she said,\\n', 'delicate point--for a woman to urge, especially so; in mentioning it,\\n', 'she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her feelings; still, for me,\\n', 'of the husband, should surpass by a few years--even by fifteen or\\n', 'twenty--the age of the wife, was regarded by the world as admissible,\\n', 'and, indeed, as even proper, but she had always entertained the belief\\n', 'that the years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the\\n', 'alas! to a life of unhappiness. Now she was aware that my own age did\\n', 'aware that the years of my Eugenie extended very considerably beyond\\n', 'that sum.\\n', '\\n', 'About all this there was a nobility of soul--a dignity of candor--which\\n', 'could scarcely restrain the excessive transport which possessed me.\\n', '\\n', 'discoursing? Your years surpass in some measure my own. But what then?\\n', 'The customs of the world are so many conventional follies. To those who\\n', 'twenty-two, you say, granted: indeed, you may as well call me, at once,\\n', 'twenty-three. Now you yourself, my dearest Eugenie, can have\\n', 'numbered no more than--can have numbered no more than--no more\\n', 'than--than--than--than--”\\n', '\\n', 'would interrupt me by supplying her true age. But a Frenchwoman is\\n', 'seldom direct, and has always, by way of answer to an embarrassing\\n', 'query, some little practical reply of her own. In the present instance,\\n', 'Eugenie, who for a few moments past had seemed to be searching for\\n', 'something in her bosom, at length let fall upon the grass a miniature,\\n', '\\n', '“Keep it!” she said, with one of her most ravishing smiles. “Keep it\\n', 'for my sake--for the sake of her whom it too flatteringly represents.\\n', 'Besides, upon the back of the trinket you may discover, perhaps, the\\n', 'very information you seem to desire. It is now, to be sure, growing\\n', 'rather dark--but you can examine it at your leisure in the morning. In\\n', 'the meantime, you shall be my escort home to-night. My friends are\\n', 'shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in, in the character of an old\\n', 'acquaintance.”\\n', '\\n', 'dark as we arrived; and in American mansions of the better sort lights\\n', 'seldom, during the heat of summer, make their appearance at this, the\\n', 'most pleasant period of the day. In about an hour after my arrival,\\n', 'to be sure, a single shaded solar lamp was lit in the principal\\n', 'unusual good taste and even splendor; but two other rooms of the suite,\\n', 'and in which the company chiefly assembled, remained, during the whole\\n', 'evening, in a very agreeable shadow. This is a well-conceived custom,\\n', 'giving the party at least a choice of light or shade, and one which our\\n', 'friends over the water could not do better than immediately adopt.\\n', '\\n', 'The evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of my life.\\n', 'Madame Lalande had not overrated the musical abilities of her friends;\\n', 'circle out of Vienna. The instrumental performers were many and of\\n', 'superior talents. The vocalists were chiefly ladies, and no individual\\n', 'sang less than well. At length, upon a peremptory call for “Madame\\n', 'Lalande,” she arose at once, without affectation or demur, from the\\n', 'chaise longue upon which she had sat by my side, and, accompanied by\\n', 'one or two gentlemen and her female friend of the opera, repaired to the\\n', 'pleasure of seeing, although not of hearing, her sing.\\n', '\\n', 'The impression she produced upon the company seemed electrical but the\\n', 'describe it. It arose in part, no doubt, from the sentiment of love\\n', 'sensibility of the singer. It is beyond the reach of art to endow either\\n', 'air or recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers. Her\\n', 'utterance of the romance in Otello--the tone with which she gave the\\n', 'words “Sul mio sasso,” in the Capuletti--is ringing in my memory yet.\\n', 'Her lower tones were absolutely miraculous. Her voice embraced three\\n', 'and, though sufficiently powerful to have filled the San Carlos,\\n', 'executed, with the minutest precision, every difficulty of vocal\\n', 'composition--ascending and descending scales, cadences, or fiorituri. In\\n', 'the final of the Somnambula, she brought about a most remarkable effect\\n', 'at the words:\\n', '\\n', '     Ah! non guinge uman pensiero\\n', '\\n', '     Al contento ond ‘io son piena.\\n', '\\n', 'Here, in imitation of Malibran, she modified the original phrase of\\n', 'interval of two octaves.\\n', '\\n', 'Upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal execution, she\\n', 'feebleness, or rather a certain tremulous indecision of voice in\\n', 'ordinary conversation, had prepared me to anticipate that, in singing,\\n', 'she would not acquit herself with any remarkable ability.\\n', '\\n', 'Our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted, and totally\\n', 'unreserved. She made me relate many of the earlier passages of my life,\\n', 'confiding affection. Encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of\\n', 'my many minor vices, but made full confession of those moral and even\\n', 'of those physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in demanding so\\n', 'much higher a degree of courage, is so much surer an evidence of love.\\n', 'troubled--of a chronic rheumatism--of a twinge of hereditary gout--and,\\n', 'in conclusion, of the disagreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto\\n', 'carefully concealed, weakness of my eyes.\\n', '\\n', '“Upon this latter point,” said Madame Lalande, laughingly, “you have\\n', 'been surely injudicious in coming to confession; for, without the\\n', 'the crime. By the by,” she continued, “have you any recollection--” and\\n', 'became distinctly visible upon her cheek--“have you any recollection,\\n', 'mon cher ami of this little ocular assistant, which now depends from my\\n', 'neck?”\\n', '\\n', 'As she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double eye-glass\\n', 'which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the opera.\\n', '\\n', 'the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my inspection. They\\n', 'formed a complex and magnificent toy, richly chased and filigreed, and\\n', 'help perceiving were of high value.\\n', '\\n', '“Eh bien! mon ami” she resumed with a certain empressment of manner that\\n', 'rather surprised me--“Eh bien! mon ami, you have earnestly besought of\\n', 'me a favor which you have been pleased to denominate priceless. You\\n', 'not be entitled to demand of you a very--a very little boon in return?”\\n', '\\n', 'observation of the company, and restrained by their presence alone\\n', 'from throwing myself impetuously at her feet. “Name it, my beloved, my\\n', 'Eugenie, my own!--name it!--but, alas! it is already yielded ere named.”\\n', '\\n', '“You shall conquer, then, mon ami,” said she, “for the sake of the\\n', 'Eugenie whom you love, this little weakness which you have at last\\n', 'confessed--this weakness more moral than physical--and which, let\\n', 'me assure you, is so unbecoming the nobility of your real nature--so\\n', 'inconsistent with the candor of your usual character--and which, if\\n', 'permitted further control, will assuredly involve you, sooner or later,\\n', 'in some very disagreeable scrape. You shall conquer, for my sake, this\\n', 'affectation which leads you, as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit\\n', 'or implied denial of your infirmity of vision. For, this infirmity\\n', 'you virtually deny, in refusing to employ the customary means for its\\n', 'spectacles;--ah, hush!--you have already consented to wear them, for my\\n', 'and which, though admirable as an aid to vision, is really of no very\\n', 'immense value as a gem. You perceive that, by a trifling modification\\n', 'thus--or thus--it can be adapted to the eyes in the form of spectacles,\\n', 'or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an eye-glass. It is in the former\\n', 'mode, however, and habitually, that you have already consented to wear\\n', 'it for my sake.”\\n', '\\n', 'the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation, of course,\\n', 'a matter altogether out of the question.\\n', '\\n', 'eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning\\n', 'upon my--upon my nose,--and there wear it ever afterward, in the less\\n', 'romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable,\\n', 'form which you desire.”\\n', '\\n', 'Our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements for the\\n', 'scarcely break up before two; and by this hour the vehicle was to be\\n', 'at the door, when, in the confusion occasioned by the departure of the\\n', 'call at the house of a clergyman who would be in waiting; there be\\n', 'married, drop Talbot, and proceed on a short tour to the East, leaving\\n', 'the fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the matter\\n', 'it thought best.\\n', '\\n', 'powerful aid of the glasses. The countenance was a surpassingly\\n', 'beautiful one! Those large luminous eyes!--that proud Grecian\\n', 'and discovered the words--“Eugenie Lalande--aged twenty-seven years and\\n', 'seven months.”\\n', '\\n', 'my good fortune. He professed excessive astonishment, of course, but\\n', 'congratulated me most cordially, and proffered every assistance in his\\n', 'power. In a word, we carried out our arrangement to the letter, and, at\\n', 'say--and driving at a great rate out of town, in a direction Northeast\\n', 'by North, half-North.\\n', '\\n', 'It had been determined for us by Talbot, that, as we were to be up all\\n', 'miles from the city, and there get an early breakfast and some repose,\\n', 'before proceeding upon our route. At four precisely, therefore, the\\n', 'wife out, and ordered breakfast forthwith. In the meantime we were shown\\n', 'into a small parlor, and sat down.\\n', '\\n', 'enraptured, at the angel by my side, the singular idea came, all at\\n', 'once, into my head, that this was really the very first moment since my\\n', 'had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness by daylight at all.\\n', '\\n', '“And now, mon ami,” said she, taking my hand, and so interrupting this\\n', 'train of reflection, “and now, mon cher ami, since we are indissolubly\\n', 'also have a little favor to bestow--a little promise which it is your\\n', 'intention to keep. Ah! let me see! Let me remember! Yes; full easily do\\n', 'last night. Listen! You spoke thus: ‘It is done!--it is most cheerfully\\n', 'dear eye-glass as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest\\n', 'will place it upon my--upon my nose,--and there wear it ever afterward,\\n', 'in the less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more\\n', 'serviceable, form which you desire.’ These were the exact words, my\\n', 'beloved husband, were they not?”\\n', '\\n', 'my beautiful Eugenie, there is no disposition on my part to evade the\\n', 'performance of the trivial promise they imply. See! Behold! they are\\n', 'becoming--rather--are they not?” And here, having arranged the glasses\\n', 'proper position; while Madame Simpson, adjusting her cap, and folding\\n', 'her arms, sat bolt upright in her chair, in a somewhat stiff and prim,\\n', 'and indeed, in a somewhat undignified position.\\n', '\\n', 'rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nose--“My goodness gracious\\n', 'me!--why, what can be the matter with these glasses?” and taking them\\n', 'adjusted them again.\\n', '\\n', 'But if, in the first instance, there had occurred something which\\n', 'occasioned me surprise, in the second, this surprise became\\n', 'elevated into astonishment; and this astonishment was profound--was\\n', 'those--and were those--were those wrinkles, upon the visage of Eugenie\\n', 'Lalande? And oh! Jupiter, and every one of the gods and goddesses,\\n', 'the spectacles violently to the ground, and, leaping to my feet, stood\\n', 'erect in the middle of the floor, confronting Mrs. Simpson, with my arms\\n', 'set a-kimbo, and grinning and foaming, but, at the same time, utterly\\n', 'speechless with terror and with rage.\\n', '\\n', 'Simpson--spoke the English language but very little better than she\\n', 'wrote it, and for this reason she very properly never attempted to speak\\n', 'it upon ordinary occasions. But rage will carry a lady to any\\n', 'extreme; and in the present care it carried Mrs. Simpson to the very\\n', 'extraordinary extreme of attempting to hold a conversation in a tongue\\n', 'that she did not altogether understand.\\n', '\\n', '“Vell, Monsieur,” said she, after surveying me, in great apparent\\n', 'astonishment, for some moments--“Vell, Monsieur?--and vat den?--vat de\\n', 'matter now?

Once upon her feet, she gnashed her gums,\\n', 'brandished her arms, rolled up her sleeves, shook her fist in my face,\\n', 'and concluded the performance by tearing the cap from her head, and with\\n', 'it an immense wig of the most valuable and beautiful black hair,\\n', 'the whole of which she dashed upon the ground with a yell, and there\\n', 'trammpled and danced a fandango upon it, in an absolute ecstasy and\\n', 'agony of rage.\\n', '\\n', 'pigeon-wings, and “Croissart and Froissart!” as she completed\\n', 'another--“Moissart and Voissart and Croissart and Napoleon Bonaparte\\n', 'Froissart!--why, you ineffable old serpent, that’s me--that’s me--d’ye\\n', '\\n', 'Madame Eugenie Lalande, quasi Simpson--formerly Moissart--was, in sober\\n', 'fact, my great, great, grandmother.

By\\n', 'the aid of these, of pearl-powder, of rouge, of false hair, false teeth,\\n', 'and false tournure, as well as of the most skilful modistes of Paris,\\n', 'she contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties en peu\\n', 'passees of the French metropolis. In this respect, indeed, she might\\n', 'have been regarded as little less than the equal of the celebrated Ninon\\n', '\\n', 'She was immensely wealthy, and being left, for the second time, a widow\\n', 'without children, she bethought herself of my existence in America,\\n', 'and for the purpose of making me her heir, paid a visit to the United\\n', 'States, in company with a distant and exceedingly lovely relative of her\\n', 'second husband’s--a Madame Stephanie Lalande.\\n', '\\n', 'At the opera, my great, great, grandmother’s attention was arrested by\\n', 'my notice; and, upon surveying me through her eye-glass, she was struck\\n', 'with a certain family resemblance to herself. Thus interested, and\\n', 'knowing that the heir she sought was actually in the city, she made\\n', 'inquiries of her party respecting me. The gentleman who attended her\\n', 'induced her to renew her scrutiny; and this scrutiny it was which so\\n', 'She returned my bow, however, under the impression that, by some odd\\n', 'of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in respect to the age and charms\\n', 'of course, and so informed me, with perfect truth, that she was “the\\n', 'celebrated widow, Madame Lalande.”\\n', '\\n', 'In the street, next morning, my great, great, grandmother encountered\\n', 'Talbot, an old Parisian acquaintance; and the conversation, very\\n', 'naturally turned upon myself. My deficiencies of vision were then\\n', 'of their notoriety, and my good old relative discovered, much to\\n', 'her chagrin, that she had been deceived in supposing me aware of her\\n', 'open love, in a theatre, to an old woman unknown. By way of punishing me\\n', 'for this imprudence, she concocted with Talbot a plot. He purposely kept\\n', 'out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction. My street inquiries\\n', 'about “the lovely widow, Madame Lalande,” were supposed to refer to\\n', 'the younger lady, of course, and thus the conversation with the three\\n', 'no opportunity of seeing Madame Lalande closely during daylight; and,\\n', 'at her musical soiree, my silly weakness in refusing the aid of glasses\\n', 'effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her age. When\\n', '“Madame Lalande” was called upon to sing, the younger lady was intended;\\n', 'and it was she who arose to obey the call; my great, great, grandmother,\\n', 'to further the deception, arising at the same moment and accompanying\\n', 'her thither, it had been her design to suggest the propriety of my\\n', 'my impression of the youth of my mistress, were executed by Madame\\n', 'Stephanie Lalande. The eyeglass was presented by way of adding a reproof\\n', 'to the hoax--a sting to the epigram of the deception. Its presentation\\n', 'afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon affectation with which\\n', 'glasses of the instrument, as worn by the old lady, had been exchanged\\n', 'by her for a pair better adapted to my years. They suited me, in fact,\\n', '\\n', 'The clergyman, who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot, was a boon\\n', 'companion of Talbot’s, and no priest. He was an excellent “whip,”\\n', ' however; and having doffed his cassock to put on a great-coat, he drove\\n', 'the hack which conveyed the “happy couple” out of town. Talbot took a\\n', 'seat at his side. The two scoundrels were thus “in at the death,”\\n', ' and through a half-open window of the back parlor of the inn, amused\\n', 'be forced to call them both out.\\n', '\\n', 'husband of Madame Lalande--of Madame Stephanie Lalande--with whom my\\n', 'good old relative, besides making me her sole heir when she dies--if\\n', 'she ever does--has been at the trouble of concocting me a match. In\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '     The gods do bear and will allow in kings\\n', '     The things which they abhor in rascal routes.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'chivalrous reign of the third Edward, two seamen belonging to the crew\\n', 'of the “Free and Easy,” a trading schooner plying between Sluys and the\\n', 'Thames, and then at anchor in that river, were much astonished to find\\n', 'themselves seated in the tap-room of an ale-house in the parish of St.\\n', 'Andrews, London--which ale-house bore for sign the portraiture of a\\n', '“Jolly Tar.”\\n', '\\n', 'The room, although ill-contrived, smoke-blackened, low-pitched, and in\\n', 'every other respect agreeing with the general character of such places\\n', 'at the period--was, nevertheless, in the opinion of the grotesque groups\\n', 'scattered here and there within it, sufficiently well adapted to its\\n', 'purpose.\\n', '\\n', 'not the most conspicuous.\\n', '\\n', 'The one who appeared to be the elder, and whom his companion addressed\\n', 'by the characteristic appellation of “Legs,” was at the same time much\\n', 'the taller of the two. He might have measured six feet and a half, and\\n', 'an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to have been the necessary\\n', 'consequence of an altitude so enormous.--Superfluities in height were,\\n', 'however, more than accounted for by deficiencies in other respects.\\n', 'He was exceedingly thin; and might, as his associates asserted, have\\n', 'answered, when drunk, for a pennant at the mast-head, or, when sober,\\n', 'have served for a jib-boom. But these jests, and others of a similar\\n', 'nature, had evidently produced, at no time, any effect upon the\\n', 'cachinnatory muscles of the tar. With high cheek-bones, a large\\n', 'hawk-nose, retreating chin, fallen under-jaw, and huge protruding white\\n', 'eyes, the expression of his countenance, although tinged with a species\\n', 'of dogged indifference to matters and things in general, was not the\\n', 'less utterly solemn and serious beyond all attempts at imitation or\\n', 'description.\\n', '\\n', 'The younger seaman was, in all outward appearance, the converse of his\\n', 'of stumpy bow-legs supported his squat, unwieldy figure, while his\\n', 'unusually short and thick arms, with no ordinary fists at their\\n', 'extremities, swung off dangling from his sides like the fins of a\\n', 'sea-turtle. Small eyes, of no particular color, twinkled far back in his\\n', 'head. His nose remained buried in the mass of flesh which enveloped his\\n', 'round, full, and purple face; and his thick upper-lip rested upon the\\n', 'still thicker one beneath with an air of complacent self-satisfaction,\\n', 'much heightened by the owner’s habit of licking them at intervals.\\n', 'He evidently regarded his tall shipmate with a feeling half-wondrous,\\n', 'half-quizzical; and stared up occasionally in his face as the red\\n', 'setting sun stares up at the crags of Ben Nevis.\\n', '\\n', 'Various and eventful, however, had been the peregrinations of the worthy\\n', 'couple in and about the different tap-houses of the neighbourhood during\\n', 'the earlier hours of the night. Funds even the most ample, are not\\n', 'always everlasting: and it was with empty pockets our friends had\\n', 'ventured upon the present hostelrie.\\n', '\\n', 'At the precise period, then, when this history properly commences, Legs,\\n', 'and his fellow Hugh Tarpaulin, sat, each with both elbows resting upon\\n', 'the large oaken table in the middle of the floor, and with a hand upon\\n', 'either cheek. They were eyeing, from behind a huge flagon of unpaid-for\\n', '“humming-stuff,” the portentous words, “No Chalk,” which to their\\n', 'indignation and astonishment were scored over the doorway by means of\\n', 'that very mineral whose presence they purported to deny. Not that the\\n', 'gift of decyphering written characters--a gift among the commonalty\\n', 'of that day considered little less cabalistical than the art of\\n', 'inditing--could, in strict justice, have been laid to the charge of\\n', 'either disciple of the sea; but there was, to say the truth, a certain\\n', 'twist in the formation of the letters--an indescribable lee-lurch about\\n', 'the whole--which foreboded, in the opinion of both seamen, a long run\\n', 'of dirty weather; and determined them at once, in the allegorical words\\n', 'of Legs himself, to “pump ship, clew up all sail, and scud before the\\n', 'wind.”\\n', '\\n', 'Having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale, and looped up\\n', 'the points of their short doublets, they finally made a bolt for the\\n', 'street. Although Tarpaulin rolled twice into the fire-place, mistaking\\n', 'it for the door, yet their escape was at length happily effected--and\\n', 'half after twelve o’clock found our heroes ripe for mischief, and\\n', 'running for life down a dark alley in the direction of St. Andrew’s\\n', 'Stair, hotly pursued by the landlady of the “Jolly Tar.”\\n', '\\n', 'At the epoch of this eventful tale, and periodically, for many years\\n', 'before and after, all England, but more especially the metropolis,\\n', 'resounded with the fearful cry of “Plague!” The city was in a great\\n', 'measure depopulated--and in those horrible regions, in the vicinity of\\n', 'the Thames, where amid the dark, narrow, and filthy lanes and alleys,\\n', 'the Demon of Disease was supposed to have had his nativity, Awe, Terror,\\n', 'and Superstition were alone to be found stalking abroad.\\n', '\\n', 'By authority of the king such districts were placed under ban, and all\\n', 'persons forbidden, under pain of death, to intrude upon their dismal\\n', 'solitude. Yet neither the mandate of the monarch, nor the huge barriers\\n', 'erected at the entrances of the streets, nor the prospect of that\\n', 'loathsome death which, with almost absolute certainty, overwhelmed\\n', 'the wretch whom no peril could deter from the adventure, prevented the\\n', 'unfurnished and untenanted dwellings from being stripped, by the hand\\n', 'of nightly rapine, of every article, such as iron, brass, or lead-work,\\n', 'which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account.\\n', '\\n', 'Above all, it was usually found, upon the annual winter opening of the\\n', 'barriers, that locks, bolts, and secret cellars, had proved but\\n', 'slender protection to those rich stores of wines and liquors which, in\\n', 'consideration of the risk and trouble of removal, many of the numerous\\n', 'dealers having shops in the neighbourhood had consented to trust, during\\n', 'the period of exile, to so insufficient a security.\\n', '\\n', 'But there were very few of the terror-stricken people who attributed\\n', 'these doings to the agency of human hands. Pest-spirits, plague-goblins,\\n', 'and fever-demons, were the popular imps of mischief; and tales so\\n', 'blood-chilling were hourly told, that the whole mass of forbidden\\n', 'buildings was, at length, enveloped in terror as in a shroud, and\\n', 'the plunderer himself was often scared away by the horrors his own\\n', 'depreciations had created; leaving the entire vast circuit of prohibited\\n', 'district to gloom, silence, pestilence, and death.\\n', '\\n', 'It was by one of the terrific barriers already mentioned, and which\\n', 'indicated the region beyond to be under the Pest-ban, that, in\\n', 'scrambling down an alley, Legs and the worthy Hugh Tarpaulin found their\\n', 'progress suddenly impeded. To return was out of the question, and no\\n', 'time was to be lost, as their pursuers were close upon their heels. With\\n', 'thorough-bred seamen to clamber up the roughly fashioned plank-work\\n', 'was a trifle; and, maddened with the twofold excitement of exercise\\n', 'and liquor, they leaped unhesitatingly down within the enclosure, and\\n', 'holding on their drunken course with shouts and yellings, were soon\\n', 'bewildered in its noisome and intricate recesses.\\n', '\\n', 'Had they not, indeed, been intoxicated beyond moral sense, their reeling\\n', 'footsteps must have been palsied by the horrors of their situation. The\\n', 'air was cold and misty. The paving-stones, loosened from their beds, lay\\n', 'in wild disorder amid the tall, rank grass, which sprang up around the\\n', 'feet and ankles. Fallen houses choked up the streets. The most fetid and\\n', 'poisonous smells everywhere prevailed;--and by the aid of that ghastly\\n', 'light which, even at midnight, never fails to emanate from a vapory and\\n', 'pestilential atmosphere, might be discerned lying in the by-paths and\\n', 'alleys, or rotting in the windowless habitations, the carcass of many\\n', 'a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague in the very\\n', 'perpetration of his robbery.\\n', '\\n', '--But it lay not in the power of images, or sensations, or impediments\\n', 'such as these, to stay the course of men who, naturally brave, and at\\n', 'that time especially, brimful of courage and of “humming-stuff!” would\\n', 'have reeled, as straight as their condition might have permitted,\\n', 'undauntedly into the very jaws of Death. Onward--still onward stalked\\n', 'the grim Legs, making the desolate solemnity echo and re-echo with yells\\n', 'like the terrific war-whoop of the Indian: and onward, still onward\\n', 'rolled the dumpy Tarpaulin, hanging on to the doublet of his more active\\n', 'companion, and far surpassing the latter’s most strenuous exertions in\\n', 'the way of vocal music, by bull-roarings in basso, from the profundity\\n', 'of his stentorian lungs.\\n', '\\n', 'They had now evidently reached the strong hold of the pestilence. Their\\n', 'way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and more horrible--the\\n', 'paths more narrow and more intricate. Huge stones and beams falling\\n', 'momently from the decaying roofs above them, gave evidence, by their\\n', 'sullen and heavy descent, of the vast height of the surrounding houses;\\n', 'and while actual exertion became necessary to force a passage through\\n', 'frequent heaps of rubbish, it was by no means seldom that the hand fell\\n', 'upon a skeleton or rested upon a more fleshly corpse.\\n', '\\n', 'Suddenly, as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall and\\n', 'ghastly-looking building, a yell more than usually shrill from the\\n', 'throat of the excited Legs, was replied to from within, in a rapid\\n', 'succession of wild, laughter-like, and fiendish shrieks. Nothing daunted\\n', 'at sounds which, of such a nature, at such a time, and in such a place,\\n', 'might have curdled the very blood in hearts less irrevocably on fire,\\n', 'the drunken couple rushed headlong against the door, burst it open, and\\n', 'staggered into the midst of things with a volley of curses.\\n', '\\n', 'The room within which they found themselves proved to be the shop of\\n', 'an undertaker; but an open trap-door, in a corner of the floor near the\\n', 'entrance, looked down upon a long range of wine-cellars, whose depths\\n', 'the occasional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed to be well stored\\n', 'with their appropriate contents. In the middle of the room stood a\\n', 'table--in the centre of which again arose a huge tub of what appeared\\n', 'to be punch. Bottles of various wines and cordials, together with\\n', 'jugs, pitchers, and flagons of every shape and quality, were scattered\\n', 'profusely upon the board. Around it, upon coffin-tressels, was seated a\\n', '\\n', 'Fronting the entrance, and elevated a little above his companions, sat a\\n', 'personage who appeared to be the president of the table. His stature was\\n', 'gaunt and tall, and Legs was confounded to behold in him a figure\\n', 'more emaciated than himself. His face was as yellow as saffron--but\\n', 'no feature excepting one alone, was sufficiently marked to merit a\\n', 'particular description. This one consisted in a forehead so unusually\\n', 'and hideously lofty, as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown\\n', 'of flesh superadded upon the natural head. His mouth was puckered and\\n', 'dimpled into an expression of ghastly affability, and his eyes, as\\n', 'indeed the eyes of all at table, were glazed over with the fumes\\n', 'of intoxication. This gentleman was clothed from head to foot in a\\n', 'richly-embroidered black silk-velvet pall, wrapped negligently around\\n', 'his form after the fashion of a Spanish cloak.--His head was stuck full\\n', 'of sable hearse-plumes, which he nodded to and fro with a jaunty and\\n', 'knowing air; and, in his right hand, he held a huge human thigh-bone,\\n', 'with which he appeared to have been just knocking down some member of\\n', 'the company for a song.\\n', '\\n', 'Opposite him, and with her back to the door, was a lady of no whit the\\n', 'less extraordinary character. Although quite as tall as the person just\\n', 'described, she had no right to complain of his unnatural emaciation. She\\n', 'was evidently in the last stage of a dropsy; and her figure resembled\\n', 'nearly that of the huge puncheon of October beer which stood, with the\\n', 'head driven in, close by her side, in a corner of the chamber. Her\\n', 'face was exceedingly round, red, and full; and the same peculiarity, or\\n', 'before mentioned in the case of the president--that is to say, only one\\n', 'feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a separate\\n', 'characterization: indeed the acute Tarpaulin immediately observed that\\n', 'the same remark might have applied to each individual person of the\\n', 'party; every one of whom seemed to possess a monopoly of some particular\\n', 'portion of physiognomy. With the lady in question this portion proved\\n', 'to be the mouth. Commencing at the right ear, it swept with a terrific\\n', 'chasm to the left--the short pendants which she wore in either auricle\\n', 'continually bobbing into the aperture. She made, however, every exertion\\n', 'to keep her mouth closed and look dignified, in a dress consisting of a\\n', 'newly starched and ironed shroud coming up close under her chin, with a\\n', 'crimpled ruffle of cambric muslin.\\n', '\\n', 'At her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom she appeared to\\n', 'patronise. This delicate little creature, in the trembling of her wasted\\n', 'fingers, in the livid hue of her lips, and in the slight hectic spot\\n', 'which tinged her otherwise leaden complexion, gave evident indications\\n', 'of a galloping consumption. An air of gave extreme haut ton, however,\\n', 'pervaded her whole appearance; she wore in a graceful and degage manner,\\n', 'a large and beautiful winding-sheet of the finest India lawn; her hair\\n', 'hung in ringlets over her neck; a soft smile played about her mouth; but\\n', 'her nose, extremely long, thin, sinuous, flexible and pimpled, hung down\\n', 'far below her under lip, and in spite of the delicate manner in which\\n', 'she now and then moved it to one side or the other with her tongue, gave\\n', 'to her countenance a somewhat equivocal expression.\\n', '\\n', 'Over against her, and upon the left of the dropsical lady, was seated a\\n', 'little puffy, wheezing, and gouty old man, whose cheeks reposed upon the\\n', 'shoulders of their owner, like two huge bladders of Oporto wine. With\\n', 'his arms folded, and with one bandaged leg deposited upon the table,\\n', 'he seemed to think himself entitled to some consideration. He evidently\\n', 'prided himself much upon every inch of his personal appearance, but took\\n', 'more especial delight in calling attention to his gaudy-colored surtout.\\n', 'This, to say the truth, must have cost him no little money, and was made\\n', 'to fit him exceedingly well--being fashioned from one of the curiously\\n', 'embroidered silken covers appertaining to those glorious escutcheons\\n', 'which, in England and elsewhere, are customarily hung up, in some\\n', 'conspicuous place, upon the dwellings of departed aristocracy.\\n', '\\n', 'Next to him, and at the right hand of the president, was a gentleman\\n', 'in long white hose and cotton drawers. His frame shook, in a ridiculous\\n', 'manner, with a fit of what Tarpaulin called “the horrors.” His jaws,\\n', 'which had been newly shaved, were tightly tied up by a bandage of\\n', 'muslin; and his arms being fastened in a similar way at the wrists,\\n', 'table; a precaution rendered necessary, in the opinion of Legs, by\\n', 'prodigious ears, nevertheless, which it was no doubt found impossible\\n', 'to confine, towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment, and were\\n', 'occasionally pricked up in a spasm, at the sound of the drawing of a\\n', 'cork.\\n', '\\n', 'Fronting him, sixthly and lastly, was situated a singularly\\n', 'stiff-looking personage, who, being afflicted with paralysis, must,\\n', 'to speak seriously, have felt very ill at ease in his unaccommodating\\n', 'habiliments. He was habited, somewhat uniquely, in a new and handsome\\n', 'mahogany coffin. Its top or head-piece pressed upon the skull of the\\n', 'wearer, and extended over it in the fashion of a hood, giving to the\\n', 'entire face an air of indescribable interest. Arm-holes had been cut in\\n', 'the sides, for the sake not more of elegance than of convenience; but\\n', 'the dress, nevertheless, prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect\\n', 'as his associates; and as he lay reclining against his tressel, at an\\n', 'angle of forty-five degrees, a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled up their\\n', 'awful whites towards the ceiling in absolute amazement at their own\\n', 'enormity.\\n', '\\n', 'Before each of the party lay a portion of a skull, which was used as\\n', 'a drinking cup. Overhead was suspended a human skeleton, by means of a\\n', 'rope tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring in the ceiling.\\n', 'The other limb, confined by no such fetter, stuck off from the body at\\n', 'right angles, causing the whole loose and rattling frame to dangle and\\n', 'twirl about at the caprice of every occasional puff of wind which found\\n', 'its way into the apartment. In the cranium of this hideous thing lay\\n', 'quantity of ignited charcoal, which threw a fitful but vivid light over\\n', 'the entire scene; while coffins, and other wares appertaining to the\\n', 'shop of an undertaker, were piled high up around the room, and against\\n', 'the windows, preventing any ray from escaping into the street.\\n', '\\n', 'At sight of this extraordinary assembly, and of their still more\\n', 'extraordinary paraphernalia, our two seamen did not conduct themselves\\n', 'with that degree of decorum which might have been expected. Legs,\\n', 'leaning against the wall near which he happened to be standing, dropped\\n', 'his lower jaw still lower than usual, and spread open his eyes to their\\n', 'fullest extent: while Hugh Tarpaulin, stooping down so as to bring his\\n', 'nose upon a level with the table, and spreading out a palm upon either\\n', 'knee, burst into a long, loud, and obstreperous roar of very ill-timed\\n', 'and immoderate laughter.\\n', '\\n', 'Without, however, taking offence at behaviour so excessively rude, the\\n', 'tall president smiled very graciously upon the intruders--nodded to them\\n', 'in a dignified manner with his head of sable plumes--and, arising, took\\n', 'each by an arm, and led him to a seat which some others of the company\\n', 'had placed in the meantime for his accommodation. Legs to all this\\n', 'offered not the slightest resistance, but sat down as he was directed;\\n', 'while the gallant Hugh, removing his coffin tressel from its station\\n', 'near the head of the table, to the vicinity of the little consumptive\\n', 'lady in the winding sheet, plumped down by her side in high glee,\\n', 'and pouring out a skull of red wine, quaffed it to their better\\n', 'acquaintance. But at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the coffin\\n', 'seemed exceedingly nettled; and serious consequences might have ensued,\\n', 'had not the president, rapping upon the table with his truncheon,\\n', 'diverted the attention of all present to the following speech:\\n', '\\n', '“It becomes our duty upon the present happy occasion”--\\n', '\\n', '“Avast there!” interrupted Legs, looking very serious, “avast there a\\n', 'have here, rigged off like the foul fiends, and swilling the snug blue\\n', 'ruin stowed away for the winter by my honest shipmate, Will Wimble the\\n', 'undertaker!”\\n', '\\n', 'At this unpardonable piece of ill-breeding, all the original company\\n', 'half started to their feet, and uttered the same rapid succession of\\n', 'wild fiendish shrieks which had before caught the attention of the\\n', 'seamen. The president, however, was the first to recover his composure,\\n', 'and at length, turning to Legs with great dignity, recommenced:\\n', '\\n', '“Most willingly will we gratify any reasonable curiosity on the part of\\n', 'guests so illustrious, unbidden though they be. Know then that in these\\n', 'title of ‘King Pest the First.’\\n', '\\n', '“This apartment, which you no doubt profanely suppose to be the shop of\\n', 'Will Wimble the undertaker--a man whom we know not, and whose plebeian\\n', 'appellation has never before this night thwarted our royal ears--this\\n', 'councils of our kingdom, and to other sacred and lofty purposes.\\n', '\\n', '“The noble lady who sits opposite is Queen Pest, our Serene Consort. The\\n', 'other exalted personages whom you behold are all of our family, and\\n', 'wear the insignia of the blood royal under the respective titles of\\n', '‘His Grace the Arch Duke Pest-Iferous’--‘His Grace the Duke\\n', 'Pest-Ilential’--‘His Grace the Duke Tem-Pest’--and ‘Her Serene Highness\\n', 'the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.’\\n', '\\n', '“As regards,” continued he, “your demand of the business upon which we\\n', 'sit here in council, we might be pardoned for replying that it concerns,\\n', 'and concerns alone, our own private and regal interest, and is in no\\n', 'manner important to any other than ourself. But in consideration of\\n', 'those rights to which as guests and strangers you may feel yourselves\\n', 'entitled, we will furthermore explain that we are here this night,\\n', 'prepared by deep research and accurate investigation, to examine,\\n', 'analyze, and thoroughly determine the indefinable spirit--the\\n', 'incomprehensible qualities and nature--of those inestimable treasures of\\n', 'the palate, the wines, ales, and liqueurs of this goodly metropolis: by\\n', 'so doing to advance not more our own designs than the true welfare of\\n', 'that unearthly sovereign whose reign is over us all, whose dominions are\\n', 'unlimited, and whose name is ‘Death’.”\\n', '\\n', '“Whose name is Davy Jones!” ejaculated Tarpaulin, helping the lady by\\n', 'his side to a skull of liqueur, and pouring out a second for himself.\\n', '\\n', '“Profane varlet!” said the president, now turning his attention to\\n', 'the worthy Hugh, “profane and execrable wretch!--we have said, that in\\n', 'consideration of those rights which, even in thy filthy person, we feel\\n', 'no inclination to violate, we have condescended to make reply to thy\\n', 'rude and unseasonable inquiries. We nevertheless, for your unhallowed\\n', 'intrusion upon our councils, believe it our duty to mulct thee and thy\\n', 'companion in each a gallon of Black Strap--having imbibed which to the\\n', 'prosperity of our kingdom--at a single draught--and upon your bended\\n', 'knees--ye shall be forthwith free either to proceed upon your way, or\\n', 'remain and be admitted to the privileges of our table, according to your\\n', 'respective and individual pleasures.”\\n', '\\n', '“It would be a matter of utter impossibility,” replied Legs, whom the\\n', 'assumptions and dignity of King Pest the First had evidently inspired\\n', 'some feelings of respect, and who arose and steadied himself by the\\n', 'table as he spoke--“It would, please your majesty, be a matter of utter\\n', 'impossibility to stow away in my hold even one-fourth part of the same\\n', 'liquor which your majesty has just mentioned. To say nothing of the\\n', 'stuffs placed on board in the forenoon by way of ballast, and not to\\n', 'mention the various ales and liqueurs shipped this evening at different\\n', 'and duly paid for at the sign of the ‘Jolly Tar.’ You will, therefore,\\n', 'please your majesty, be so good as to take the will for the deed--for by\\n', 'of all a drop of that villainous bilge-water that answers to the hall of\\n', '‘Black Strap.’”\\n', '\\n', '“Belay that!” interrupted Tarpaulin, astonished not more at the length\\n', 'of his companion’s speech than at the nature of his refusal--“Belay that\\n', 'and as for the matter of your share of the cargo, why rather than raise\\n', '\\n', '“This proceeding,” interposed the president, “is by no means in\\n', 'accordance with the terms of the mulct or sentence, which is in its\\n', 'nature Median, and not to be altered or recalled. The conditions we have\\n', 'imposed must be fulfilled to the letter, and that without a moment’s\\n', 'hesitation--in failure of which fulfilment we decree that you do here be\\n', 'tied neck and heels together, and duly drowned as rebels in yon hogshead\\n', 'of October beer!”\\n', '\\n', 'decree!--a most worthy and upright, and holy condemnation!” shouted the\\n', 'Pest family altogether. The king elevated his forehead into innumerable\\n', 'wrinkles; the gouty little old man puffed like a pair of bellows; the\\n', 'lady of the winding sheet waved her nose to and fro; the gentleman in\\n', 'the cotton drawers pricked up his ears; she of the shroud gasped like a\\n', 'dying fish; and he of the coffin looked stiff and rolled up his eyes.\\n', '\\n', '“Ugh! ugh! ugh!” chuckled Tarpaulin without heeding the general\\n', 'marlin-spike, that as for the matter of two or three gallons more or\\n', 'less of Black Strap, it was a trifle to a tight sea-boat like myself not\\n', 'overstowed--but when it comes to drinking the health of the Devil (whom\\n', 'God assoilzie) and going down upon my marrow bones to his ill-favored\\n', 'be nobody in the whole world, but Tim Hurlygurly the stage-player--why!\\n', 'it’s quite another guess sort of a thing, and utterly and altogether\\n', 'past my comprehension.”\\n', '\\n', 'He was not allowed to finish this speech in tranquillity. At the name\\n', 'Tim Hurlygurly the whole assembly leaped from their name seats.\\n', '\\n', '“Treason!” shouted his Majesty King Pest the First.\\n', '\\n', '“Treason!” said the little man with the gout.\\n', '\\n', '“Treason!” screamed the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.\\n', '\\n', '“Treason!” muttered the gentleman with his jaws tied up.\\n', '\\n', '“Treason!” growled he of the coffin.\\n', '\\n', '“Treason! treason!” shrieked her majesty of the mouth; and, seizing by\\n', 'the hinder part of his breeches the unfortunate Tarpaulin, who had just\\n', 'commenced pouring out for himself a skull of liqueur, she lifted him\\n', 'high into the air, and let him fall without ceremony into the huge open\\n', 'puncheon of his beloved ale.
